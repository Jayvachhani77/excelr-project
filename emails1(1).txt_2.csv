likely need to do initial stack compliance tests at the lowest load we would 
operate the plant.

Since the emission guarantees from GE will likely be for a range of 50 to 100

85 MW per turbine) as the mimimum turbine load.

Do you have to follow in your father's footsteps when you grow up?
How would it be if I kicked the ball through the clouds and God caught it?
Can you see God?
Where is God?
Why did Dolly die (pathology, not philosophy)?  Was it fleas and worms?

And when he was  mad at Neil:  Mom, you picked the wrong husband.

Michael has been peppering me with questions lately:

Do you have to be rich to run for president?
Do you have to follow in your father's footsteps when you grow up?
How would it be if I kicked the ball through the clouds and God caught it?
Can you see God?
Where is God?
Why did Dolly die (pathology, not philosophy)?  Was it fleas and worms?

And when he was  mad at Neil:  Mom, you picked the wrong husband.

I'm sure there have been more - this was just Sunday and Monday!

We're having a small get together Wednesday, November 15 at Champs (located
in the Uptown Park shopping center, near McCormick & Schmick at the corner
of 610 and Post Oak).  I'm sure there's a lot of us who didn't get to say
good-bye so, stop by for a drink and wish Dewey good luck in his new
adventure.

        Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary
the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother there, and
the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, ""Dear
woman, here is your son,"" and to the disciple, ""Here is your mother."" From
that time on, this disciple took her into his home.
        John 19:25-27 (NIV)

        Even while dying on the cross, Jesus was concerned about his family.
He instructed John to care for Mary, Jesus' mother. Our families are
precious gifts from God, and we should value and care for them under all
circumstances. Neither Christian work nor key responsibilities in any job or
position excuse us from caring for our families. What can you do today to
show your love to your family?

 Little Amy was in the garden filling in a hole when her neighbor peered over the fence. Interested in what the cheek-faced youngster was doing, he politely asked, ""What are you up to there, Amy?"" 

 ""My goldfish died,"" replied Amy tearfully, without looking up, ""and I've just buried him."" 

 The neighbor was concerned, ""That's an awfully big hole for a goldfish, isn't it?"" 

 Amy patted down the last heap of earth then replied, ""That's because he's inside your damn cat.""

10)  You are guaranteed to get at least a little something in the sack.

9)  If you get tired, you can wait 10 minutes and go at it again.

8)  The uglier you look, the easier it is to get some.

7)  You don't have to compliment the person that gives you some.

6)  It's ok when the person you're with fantasizes you're someone else because you are.

5)  20 years from now you'll still enjoy candy.

4)  If you don't like what you get, you can always go next door.

3)  It doesn't matter if the kids hear you moaning and groaning.

2)  Less guilt the morning after.

University of Texas police have smashed a suspected terrorist cell. 
Three terrorists, Bin Losin, Bin Whinin, and Bin Cryin were apprehended 
on the UT campus shortly after the defeat of the Longhorn football team
by the University of Oklahoma Sooners. University police warn a fourth 
terrorist, Bin Winnin, is still at large. However, sources within 
the department concede that Winnin would be very conspicuous on the UT
campus and suspect he has fled to the campus of Oklahoma University.

These are actually pretty good:


RULES FOR MEN TO LIVE BY....
>
>1. Any Man who brings a camera to a stag night may be legally killed and
>eaten by his fellow partygoers.
>
>2. Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.
>
>3. It is ok for a man to cry under the following circumstances:
>         a. When a heroic dog dies to save it's master
>         b. The moment Angelina Jolie starts unbuttoning her blouse
>         c. After wrecking your boss' car.
>         d. One hour, 12 minutes, 37 seconds into ""The Crying Game"".
>         e. When your Date is using her teeth
>
>4. Unless he murdered someone in your family, you must bail a friend
>out of jail within 12 hours.
>
>5. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend move
>         a. Your legs have been severed in a freak threshing accident
>         b. You'd rather stay home and watch speed buggy reruns.
>
>7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off
>limits forever, unless you actually marry her.
>
>8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy who's running
late is 5 minutes. Maximum waiting time: 6 minutes. For a girl, you have to
wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10
scale.
>
>9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a Mate's fridge is
>forbidden.  Gripe at will if the temperature is unsuitable.
>
>10. No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for another man
>(in fact, even remembering your Mate's birthday is strictly optional).
>
>11. On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops, not the
>weakest.
>
>12. While your girlfriend must bond with your Mates' girlfriends within 30
>minutes of meeting them, you are not required to make nice with her gal
>pals' significant dick-heads - low level sports bonding is all the law
>requires (sorry ladies, it's called a double standard and we drew the short
>straw on that one).
>
>13. Unless you have signed a lucrative endorsement contract, do not
>appear in public wearing more than one Nike swoosh.
>
>14. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you may
>always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's
>playing.
>
>15. You may flatulate in front of a woman only after you have brought her
>to climax. If you trap her head under the covers for the purpose of
>flatulent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend.
>
>16. It is permissible to quaff a fruity chick drink only when you're
sunning on a tropical beach....and it's delivered by a topless
supermodel...and it's free.
>
>17. Only in situations of Moral and/or Ass peril are you allowed to kick
>another guy in the nuts.
>
>18. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.
>
>19. Friends don't let friends wear Speedos. Ever. Issue closed.
>
>20. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem---you didn't see
>nothin'.
>
>21. Women who claim they ""love to watch sports"" must be treated as spies
>until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to drink as
>much beer as the other sports watchers.
>
>22. You must offer heartfelt and public condolences over the death of a
>girlfriend's cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire and threw
>it into a ceiling fan.
>
>23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must
>remain sober enough to fight.
>
>24. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of
>pizza, but not both. That's just plain mean.
>
>25. If you complement a guy on his six-pack, you'd better be talking
>about his choice of beer.
>
>26. Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a Mate of yours,
>except if she's withholding sex pending your response.
>
>27. Phrases that may not be uttered to another man while lifting
>weights:
>         a. Yeah, Baby, Push it!
>         b. C'mon, give me one more! Harder!
>         c. Another set and we can hit the showers! d.
>         Nice Ass, are you a Sagitarius?
>
>28. Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal footing:
>both urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other situations, an
>almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need.
>
>29. Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than you are
>able to have sex with her. Keep a stopwatch by the phone; Hang up if
necessary.
>
>30. When a Mate is trying to hook you up, you may sabotage him only in a
>manner that gives you no chance of getting laid either.
>
>31. You cannot rat out a co-worker who shows up at work with a massive
>hangover. You may however, hide the aspirin, smear his chair with
limburger cheese, turn the brightness dial all the way down so he thinks his
monitor is broken, and have him paged over the loudspeaker every seven
minutes.
>
>32. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly ""just a friend""
>have carnal drunken monkey sex, the fact that your feeling weird and
guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a
big mistake it was.
>

Subject:	Quality Moves to utilize on your next date

God Bless America. If anyone uses one of these moves please report back to me with your results.  I will attempt the Shanghai Shampoo on my date tonight.

HOW TO IMPRESS YOUR GIRLFRIEND
These are techniques that have been sent to me by various Bunthaus heads. I want to again stress that in no way do we condone the techniques listed here or practice these. Except maybe the Turkey Shoot and the Rear Admiral. And definitely the Spicey Stanley.
Here is a fairly extensive compilation of some of the extraordinary sexual activities that can be performed by men: 
1. Tea bag - As you are sitting on a girl's face, repeatedly dip your scrotum in and out of her mouth, similar to a tea bag in a cup of hot water. An old favorite. 
2. Hot Lunch - While receiving head from a woman, you shit on her chest. (a.k.a. the Cleveland Steamer)
3. The Stranger - Sitting on your hand until it falls asleep and then jerking off, eliciting the feeling of a hand job from someone else.
4. Donkey Punch - Banging a girl doggy style and then moments before you cum, sticking your dick in her ass, and then punching her in the back of the head. This gives a tremendous sensation, but for it to work correctly, the girl must be knocked out so that her asshole tightens up.
5. Golden Shower - Any form of peeing on a girl. (aka: watersports)
6. Pearl Necklace - Well known. Whenever you cum on the neck/cleavage area of a girl, it takes on the look of beautiful jewelry.
7. Coyote - This occurs when you wake up in the room of a nasty skank and you know you've got to give her the slip. However, you realize that your arm is wrapped around her. Therefore, you must gnaw off your own arm to get out of this situation. Can be very painful.
8. Purple Mushroom - This occurs when a woman is giving you oral sex and you withdraw your penis in order to poke it back into her cheek. It should leave a lasting impression similar to a purple mushroom.
9. The Flying Camel - A personal favorite. As she is lying on her back and you are hammering her from your knees, you carefully balance yourself without using your arms to prop yourself up. You then to flap your arms and let out a long, shrieking howl. Strictly a class move. 
10. Double Fishhook - From the doggy-style position, you hook your pinky fingers in her mouth and pull back to achieve deeper penetration.
11. The Ram - Again, you're attacking from behind, when you start ramming her head against the wall in a rhythmic motion. The force of the wall should allow for deeper penetration. Very handy for those lulls in penile sensitivity.
12. Dog in a Bathtub - This is the proper name for when you attempt to insert your nuts into a girl's ass. It is so named because it can be just as hard as keeping a dog in the tub while giving it a bath.
13. The Bronco - Back to reality with this classic. You start by going doggy style and then just when she is really enjoying it, you grab onto her tits as tightly as possible and yell another girl's name. This gives you the feeling of riding a bronco as she tries to buck you off. 
14. Pink Glove - This frequently happens during sex when a girl is not wet enough. When you pull out to give her the money, the inside of her twat sticks to your hog. Thus, the pink glove.
15. The Fountain of You - While sitting on her face and having her eat your ass, jerk off like a madman. Build up as much pressure as possible before releasing, spewing like a venerable geyser all over her face, neck and tits. (Better in her bed) 
16. New York Style Taco - Anytime when you are so drunk that when you go down on her, you puke on her box. Happy trails!
17. Dirty Sanchez - While banging a girl doggy style, quickly stick 2 fingers deep into her starfish, then reach around and wipe the residue on her upper lip, providing her a mustache.
18. Western Grip - When jerking off, turn your hand around, so that your thumb is facing towards you. It is the same grip that rodeo folks use; hence, western. 
19. The Blumpkin - You need to find a real tramp to do this right. It involves having her suck you off while you're on the shitter.
20. The Bismark - Another one involving oral sex. Right before you are about to spew, pull out and shoot all over her face. Follow that with a punch and smear the blood and jism together.
21. Jelly Doughnut - A derivation of the Bismark. All you have to do is punch her in the nose while you are getting head. 
22. Woody Woodpecker - While a chick is sucking on your balls, repeatedly tap the head of your cock on her forehead.
23. Tossing salad - Well known by now. A prison act where one person is forced to chow starfish with the help of whatever condiments are available, i.e. Jello, jism, etc
24. The Fish Eye - Working from behind, you shove your finger in her pooper. Thereupon, she turns around in a one-eyed winking motion to see what the hell you are doing.
25. Tuna Melt - You're down on a chick, lapping away, and you discover that it's her time of the month. By no means do you stop though. When the whale spews, tartar sauce with a hint of raspberry smothers your face. 
26. The Fur Ball - You're chomping away at some mighty Zena who has a mane between her legs the size of Lionel Richie's afro, when a mammoth fur ball gets lodged in your throat. You punch her. 
27. The Chili Dog - You take a dump on the girl's chest and then titty fuck her.
28. Gaylord Perry - Going to only one knuckle during an anal probe is for wimps. Make this famous knuckle-ball pitcher proud and use multiple digits on that virgin corn hole. A minimum of 2 knuckles required (either on one finger or on multiple). 
29. The Rear Admiral - An absolute blast. When getting a chick from behind (with both partners standing), make sure you don't let her grab onto anything when she is bent over. Then, drive your hips into her backside so that the momentum pushes her forward. The goal is to push her into a wall or table, or have her trip and fall on her face. You attain the status of Admiral when you can push her around the room without crashing into anything and not using your hands to grab onto her hips.
30. Glass Bottom Boat - Putting saran wrap over the skank's face and taking a dump.
31. Ray Bans - Put your nuts over her eye sockets while getting head. You're can is on her forehead. Yes, it may be anatomically impossible, but it is definitely worth a try. 
32. The Snowmobile - When plugging a girl while she's on all fours, reach around and sweep out her arms so she falls on her face. 
33. The Dutch Oven - Also well known. Whenever you fart while humping, pull the covers over her head. Don't let her out until all movement ceases. 
34. Smoking Pole - Self Explanatory. Don't use fire.
35. Rusty Trombone - Getting the reacharound while getting your salad tossed. Also known as milking the prostate.
36. Turkey Shoot - When you're coming, come on her face and let it drip off her chin so it looks like that red shit on the turkey's chin.
37. Stovepiping - Taking it in the Tush.
38. Rusty Anchor - After a healthy term of the Stovepiping, the recipient gets to enjoy a good fudgesicle.
39. Sandpiper - A stovepiping on the local beach, desert, or playground sandbox. Also known as the Sandblast. 
40. Lucky Pierre - the middle man in a three way buttfuck. Also known as the french sandwich.

42.Blump- To suck someone's dick while they are taking a dump.

47.Flatulence- The emergency vehicle that picks you up after you are run over by a steamroller. 
48.Butt Rodeo- When you're going at it with a girl, you flip her over real fast, start ramming her in the ass and yell as loud as possible ""BUTT RODEO!"" You then see how long you can ride her till she tosses ya off!
49.Bargoyle- The hideous old hair-spray hag who seems to live at your local watering hole. She usually smokes endlessly, spends hundreds of dollars a night on video-poker, and makes sexually threatening comments to frightened college freshmen.

56.The Kangmin - while a girl is reciting bad poetry, you take her from behind. 
57.The Flaming Amazon- This one's for all you pyromaniacs out there. When you're screwing some chick, right when your about to cum, pull out and quickly grab the nearest lighter and set her pubes on fire, then extinguish the flames with your jizz!
58.The Screwnicorn -When a dyke puts her strap-on dildo on her forehead and proceeds to go at her partner like a crazed unicorn.
59.Split pissonality -When you're taking a leak and you get two streams out of the one hole! 
60.A Short in the Cord- A ""code"" phrase used by the common man to refer to Testicular Tendon Tangle Syndrome. Ex. ""Oh fuck! My nuts are killing me... I think I've got a short in the cord.""

64.Anal Boot- An anal boot is when you take a pitcher of beer, everyone spits in it, someone stirs it with their cock and then the mixture is poured through the crack of a man ass into the waiting mouth of the loser of a bet or drinking game. 
65.Australian Death Grip- The act of grabbing a woman by the haunches/crotch and staring deeply into her eyes until you're slapped or kissed. A recommended tactic for very crowded bars. Another great opportunity for wagering among friends.
66.Fumilingus -When a man (or woman) performs cunnilingus on a woman and she farts directly in his/her face. 
67.Intoxicourse- Having sexual intercourse whilst piss-drunk.
68.Valsalva -The act of pinching shut (with thumb and forefinger) a woman's nose while receiving fellatio; most effective when employed just prior to the release point due to the gag reflex and ensuing swallow that the woman is forced to do to continue breathing. A great first date ploy, as it sets the stage for what the rules of engagement will be going forward.
69.Insta-gasm -Pre-mature ejaculation at the sight of a beautiful woman. ie: ""She was so fine, I had an insta-gasm before I could get her clothes off!""
70.Manual Deconstipation -This is where you get out the hand cream and go in manually for the hammerhead by breaking it into smaller chunks and pulling it out a piece at a time.

73.Pegging - having a female take you in the rear with a strap on.

76. Angry dragon - This involves the girl giving the guy head and as he is about to cum slapping the girl on the back of the head causing the cum to come out her nose. Great care should be used to not slap her mouth shut.
77. Tony Danza - a takeoff of the donkey punch is called the Tony Danza. When you are about to cum while doing a girl from behind, you say ""who's the boss?"" and stick it in her ass. Before she says anything you shout ""TONY DANZA!"" and punch her in the back of the head.
78. Alaskan firedragon - another good take off is one of the angry dragon that is called the alaskan firedragon. When a girl is giving you a blowjob, cum in her mouth unexpectedly and plug up her mouth at the same time. Then whisper in her ear ""i have syphilis"" so she spews it out her nose.
79. The Walrus - when she's giving u a blowjob and u cum in her mouth unexpectadly, cover up her mouth and punch her in the stomach. 
80. The Fat Lip - If you get poison ivy and finger a girl, her labia lips will swell. A la, the fat lip.
81. Sleeping Bag - If you're going down on a really fat girl, you pull her enormous stomach roll of fat over your head.
82. Hummer Bird - when a girl is giving a guy a hummer, and he's enjoying it, she bites on his bird. 
83. Bloody Mary - when a drunk guy is going down on a girl and without even realizing it after he's done, he realizes Mary was very Bloody
84. The Houdini - this maneuver is accomplished while going at it doggy style. As you feel you are about to cum, you pull out and spit on the small of her back (making her think you've finished...). It's at the point when she turns around when *BAM!* You bust your load in her face (in the eye if you've got proper aiming techniques down.) Also known as the Doug Hennings and the David Copperfield.
85. Upperdecking - This one takes practice. This maneuver requires a toilet with a tank above it, like the ones in most homes. Instead of crapping in the bowl, you shit in the tank (i.e. upperdecking). Now don't flush. When the following victim flushes, the rancid waste fills the bowl. If you play your cards right, it may ferment 
86. Journey into darkness - This is the most disturbing of all. It entails shitting into another person's asshole. Not for beginners.
87. Rocky Balboa - dont shower for 2 weeks, then diarrhea down her throat at any point during sexual contact.
88. Rocky Balboa Title Punch - same as the Rocky Balboa, but in that non-showering 2 weeks all you eat is corn. 
I don't usually do this, but I have to give credit to Sascha and Zach for the next 2. I'm only doing this because they are my bosses kids... 
89. The McDonald's Quick Draw - Get your girlfriend to talk dirty into the intercom, making the order guy start to beat off. Then while pulling up to the window, have her give you falatio till you are about to blow your beefy chunk-load. Upon pulling up to the window, tell your girl friend to yell ""Draw!"". Then on ""three"", both you and the guy blow your loads either on her or eachother.
90. Uncle Jemima - the typical dirty chef at your local Denny's or other low-class food establishment who occasionally becomes disgruntled, and takes out his frustration on your meal, via ""the ass wipe"" or the ""French Toast Strut"" seen in Road Trip. 
91. Airtight - this is where a girl has a cock in each of her three holes, hence, airtight.
92. The Throne of Lightning - This is done by fucking a girl while you shit in a toilet. When you're going to blow your load, turn her over and dunk her head in the toilet, while she's bobbing for your turd plummet a river of semen in her ass. Not to be confused with ""Ride the Lightning,"" a Metallica album
93. Abe Lincoln - You're getting a girl up the ass and give her a swift donkey punch to the back of her head, knocking her unconscious. You then turn her around and jerk off and blow your load all over her face. Then you shave her beaver and take the clippings and spread it where you jizzed on her, making a beard that looks like good ol Honest Abe's. 
94. Thanksgiving - Just like the holiday, Thanksgiving is when you do a girl and then she puts her two big butt cheeks on your face like holiday hams. An overcooked thanksgiving is similar to this but instead of just putting the cheeks on your head she farts on it too. 
95. PEUM - An acronym coined by a group of drunk assholes that defines the annoying (and uncontrollable) tendency to piss in multiple directions after a raucous fuck: Post-Ejaculatory Urinary Misfire. 
96. The Beverly Hills Whiffer -This move is restricted to those women who think they're God's gift to the world. Find a woman of the above description. Take her home and start doggie styling her. When you're about to blow, corkscrew two fingers into her ass, scraping as much shit as you can from her. Pull out your fingers, reach around her head to stick one finger in each nostril. Pull her head back so she can see you while you yell ""So, you think your shit don't stink now ?!"" 
97. Shanghai Shampoo - Fuck a chick until you've built up a load large enough to paint a room. Blow it all in her hair, rub it in thoroughly. When it dries it will resemble the crunchy noodles often served with chop suey. 
98 . Frosting the Cake - When you are about to cum, blow a load all over her chest. Then take your dick and evenly spread the Jism around the breasts and over the nipples. Then stick some candles on it and start singing ""Happy Birthday."" Then blow out the candles 
99. Spicey Stanley - When a girl takes hot sauce and pours it on your cock. She then proceeds to give you a blowjob, making sure all of the hot sauce is gone.

Effective October 1st...BPA transmission will be the following prices...

BPA non-firm point to point (or network) will be $2.92 with 1.9% losses

BPA non-firm on the intertie will be $3.34 with 3% losses

Losses could be expected to add up to $5 of the total price--do not put losses into the purchase from BPA Transmission in Enpower--losses for BPA will be settled at the end of the month in a single annuity.

Total price for MPC to CAISO at MALIN on BPA non-firm all the way will be $6.26
Total price for MPC to CAISO at NOB on BPA NON-FIRM all the way will be $6.26--Remember to check tranny sheet for PGE-tranny availability--WE HAVE NO MORE LT FIRM FROM BIG EDDY TO NOB--

NEVP called at 21:00 and informed us the cut.  Dynegy was not able to resupply the energy so I bought APS tranny and power from EPE for $70.00 and will show it in the EL PASO model as a sell from EPE to DYNEGY 8MW @ $70 Palo Verde.  The Tranny from APS was $3.50, and I will show an annuity for this amount billed to Dynegy.  I built two annuities for the tranny purchase from APS and its subsequent billing to Dynegy (674830 & 674831).  The EPEC deals that relate to the cut are 674832 and 674833.

As time progressed, things eventually were discussed regarding me that did not go well for Lonnie.  It is definitely not okay for him to talk to me (because of my past relationships) and I don't want to cause any more confusion for him with Tony.  Itsn't this childish!!!  I'm a grown ass woman, dealing with this shit regarding someone who doesn't mean a damn thing to me.  (I hope I'm not too late!)

There is an interconnect problem on NIGS/NICOR deal #351901.  Unify is only 
showing the purchase from excelr Energy Services at point name NIG/NGPL 
Central Point.  The deal shows for 1,458 mmbtu.  The sales to the transaction 
is missing.  Could you please look into this and let me know as I am trying 
to get this cleared.

Thanks,

Just a FYI---Recent developments---there is a slim chance that you may here from Tony Conway or Donnell in the near future trying to be nosey about me and Lonnie...please keep everything on the downlow.  As time progressed, things eventually were discussed regarding me that did not go well for Lonnie.  It is definitely not okay for him to talk to me (because of my past relationships) and I don't want to cause any more confusion for him with Tony.  Itsn't this childish!!!  I'm a grown ass woman, dealing with this shit regarding someone who doesn't mean a damn thing to me.  (I hope I'm not too late!)

I hope we can roll tonight so I can fill you in, I have a 5:30 hair appointment, so I'll be leaving at 4:50 so let me know.

Also, sorry about the choir,  what's wrong with Doren, he's seems to be sick alot.  Greg will probably ""fire his ass"" this week for messing up his ""Big Day"" on Easter.  That's a shame!

You mean to tell me you wore the new dress without the blouse/jacket.  That is wonderful, I told you not to worry about your arms.  You did look real good in the dress, the colors were beautiful.

8. Diverts attention from the fact that you also came to work drunk. 

7. People stop stealing your pens after they've seen where you keep them. 

6. You want to see if it's like the dream. 

5. To stop those creepy programmer guys from looking down your blouse. 

4. ""I'd love to chip in... but I left my wallet in my pants."" 

3. Inventive way to finally meet that 'special' person in Human Resources. 

2. Can take advantage of your computer monitor radiation to work on your 
tan. 

And...drum roll...the Number One reason to go to work naked : 

Your boss will never say, ""I wanna see your ass in here by 8:00!"" 
ever again.

""Ten Reasons To Go To Work Naked"" 

10. No one ever steals your chair. 

9. Gives ""bad hair day"" a whole new meaning. 

8. Diverts attention from the fact that you also came to work drunk. 

7. People stop stealing your pens after they've seen where you keep them. 

6. You want to see if it's like the dream. 

5. To stop those creepy programmer guys from looking down your blouse. 

4. ""I'd love to chip in... but I left my wallet in my pants."" 

3. Inventive way to finally meet that 'special' person in Human Resources. 

2. Can take advantage of your computer monitor radiation to work on your 
tan.

Your boss will never say, ""I wanna see your ass in here by 8:00!""

April 27th has been selected for work weekend. Chris will be going with his 
highschool buddies (toby, bobby, etc.)
Pig will be drinking Beliken Beer in Belize at the Victoria House,,,,which 
means we will not eat well. We can, however, drink well. Chris I would lay 
your hands on a back up CO2 can. I would hate to have a cold keg and no way 
to get the beer out of it.
Chad says he is in.
I'm in.
Joe hopefully is in.
Chet and Brad you guys are invited to come.

We will be moving the Pig stand to the bone yard location and moving bone 
yard box to the new location selected near the windmill and tank in the half 
section. Moving feed pens as well.
Standard closing and taping of other blinds and pulling motors for summer.

Looking forward to it.

Please confirm if you are IN or OUT.

For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. ""We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!"" The man said, ""You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife."" The agent said, ""Then you are not the right man for this job.""

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. ""I tried, but I can't kill my wife."" The agent said, ""You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.""

Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, ""This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair.""

blast
>> >>
>> >>6:20  Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
>> >>
>> >>7:30  Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)

>> >>
>> >>8:53  Crack open second beer
>> >>
>> >>8:58  Crack open...(you get the idea)
>> >>
>> >>10:30  Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for
smoooooth 95
>> >>
>> >>10:35  Headed for San Antonio
>> >>
>> >>10:50  Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
>> >>
>> >>11:10  We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a
liquor
>> >>store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
>> >>
>> >>11:50  Arrive at the tailgate spot.  Awesome day.  Not a single cloud
in
>> >>the sky.  About 70 degrees.
>> >>
>> >>11:55  I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
>> >>
>> >>11:56  I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
>> >>
>> >>12:15  The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.  We're on the
>> >>second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred
>> >>of us).  We're hooting and hollering like wildmen.  The band doubles
back
>> >>to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes
>> >>of Texas.  AWESOME MOMENT.
>> >>
>> >>12:25  In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping
>> >>chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and
certain
>> >>of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
>> >>
>> >>1:00  The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.  Again,
we

right
>> >>below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight
songs.
>> >>  Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain
>> >>convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
>> >>
>> >>1:30  I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
>> >>""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
>> >>
>> >>1:47  I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans.  They are taunting me.
I
>> >>am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out
of
>> >>Nebraska.  I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to
play
>> >>what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop
Out.""
>> >>Remember flop out for a dollar?  The rules are similar.  I tell this
>> >>Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop
>> >>out"" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix
for
>> >>the Fiesta Bowl.   And then I spoke these memorable words:  ""And not
those
>> >>damn refundable tickets, either!  You request those non-refundable,
>> >>non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!""   He backs down.  He is unworthy.
I
>> >>call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable
and
>> >>non-transferrable.  Price:  $712.  He is humbled.  He lowers his head
in
>> >>shame.  I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas
>> >>fans. I am KING and these are my subjects.  I distribute the 11 beers
in my
>> >>pants to the cheering masses.  I RULE the pre-game kingdom.
>> >>
>> >>2:34  Kickoff.  Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour
my
>> >>first stiffy.
>> >>
>> >>2:45  I notice something troubling:  Nebraska is big.  Nebraska is
fast.
>> >>Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
>> >>
>> >>3:01  The first quarter mercifully ends.  9 yards total offense for
Texas.
>> >>Zero first downs for Texas.  I'm still talking shit.  I pour another
stiffy
>> >>from the Traveler.
>> >>
>> >>3:36  Four minutes to go in the first half:  the Traveler is a dead
>> >>soldier.  I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants.  While I
am
>> >>standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and
>> >>rolls out of the end zone.  Safety.
>> >>
>> >>3:56  Halftime score:  Nebraska 15, Texas 0.  I wish I had another
>> >>Traveler.
>> >>
>> >>4:11  While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at
halftime, I
>> >>attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
>> >>""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock.""  He is unamused.
>> >>
>> >>4:21  I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants.  I
share
>> >>my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me.  Surprisingly,
they
>> >>are equipped with a flask full of vodka.  I send them off to purchase
$5
>> >>Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka.  I have not lost faith.
>> >>Nebraska is a bunch of pussies.
>> >>
>> >>4:51  No more vodka.  The girls sitting behind me have fled for their
>> >>lives.  I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
>> >>
>> >>5:18  Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0.  I am beginning to lose faith.
This

field.
>> >>
>> >>5:27  I call Southwest Airlines:  ""I'm sorry, sir.  Those tickets have
been
>> >>confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
>> >>
>> >>5:37  I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession
>> >>counter.  As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be
>> >>sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock.  I am
enraged by
>> >>this policy.  I ask loudly:  ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last
call
>> >>over the fucking PA system??!!""

>> >>awaking from my coma, ""Iz we winnig?  Did wez scort?""  Alas, the answer
is
>> >>no, we were not winning and we did not score.  The largest (by far)
cheer

walking

the

zone.
>> >>I cheer wildly.  I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my
tongue in
>> >>it.  I am thirsty.
>> >>
>> >>6:16  Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck.  I
would
>> >>taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am
too
>> >>drunk to form complete sentences.  With my last cognitive thought of
the
>> >>evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
>> >>October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
>> >>
>> >>6:30  Back in the car.  On the way back to Austin for the 8:00
>> >>Texas-Arizona tip off.  We can still salvage the day!  I crack open a
beer.
>> >>  It is warm.  I don't care.
>> >>
>> >>7:12  We have stopped for gas.  I am hungry.  I go inside the store.  I
>> >>walk past the beer frig.  I notice a Zima.  I've never had a Zima.  I
>> >>wonder if it's any good.  I pull a Zima from the frig.  I twist the top
off
>> >>and drink the Zima in three swallows.  Zima sucks.  I replace the empty
>> >>bottle in the frig.
>> >>
>> >>7:17  There is a Blimpie Subs in the store.  I walk to where the
>> >>ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub.  There is no
one
>> >>there.  I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black
>> >>olives.  I eat them.  I am still hungry.  I lean further over the
counter
>> >>and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami.  I walk out of the store
>> >>grunting and eating Pastrami.  The patrons in the store fear me.  I
don't
>> >>care.
>> >>
>> >>8:01  We are in South Austin.  I have been drinking warm beer and
singing
>> >>Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour.  My truck-mate is tired of my
>> >>singing.  He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other
good
>> >>songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon""
and
>> >>that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
>> >>excessive.  Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its
own.
>> >>I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
>> >>
>> >>8:30  We arrive at the Erwin Center.  My truckmate, against my loud and
>> >>profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking
garage.
>> >>I tell him he's an idiot.  I tell him we will never get out.  I tell
him we
>> >>may as well pitch a fucking tent here.  He ignores me.  I think he's
still
>> >>pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes.  I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
>> >>
>> >>8:47  I am rallying.  I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants.  We're
going
>> >>to kick the shit out of Arizona.
>> >>
>> >>9:11  Halftime score:  Texas 31, Arizona 29.  I am pleased.  I go to
the
>> >>bathroom to pee for the 67th time today.  I giggle to myself because of
the
>> >>new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice.""  There are no Arizona fans
in
>> >>the bathroom.  I am disappointed.  I tell myself (out loud)  that I
have a
>> >>""Niiiiiice cock.""  No one is amused but me.
>> >>
>> >>9:41  I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.
>> >>Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center, much less
Bud
>> >>Light out of a can.  I am stopped by an usher:  ""Where did you get
that,
>> >>sir?""  I tell him (no shit):  ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them
up
>> >>with those little plastic footballs.  Would you mind throwing this away
for
>> >>me?""  I take the last swig and hand it to him.  He is confused.  I
pretend
>> >>I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead.  I duck
into
>> >>some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me.  I sneak into
a
>> >>large group of people and sit down.  The usher walks by harmlessly.  I
am
>> >>giggling like a little girl.  I crack open another can of Bud Light.
>> >>
>> >>9:52  I am lost.  In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lost my
bearings.
>> >>I have no ticket stub.  I cannot find my seats.  Texas is losing.
>> >>
>> >>10:09  Texas is being screwed by the refs.  I am enraged.  I have
cleared
>> >>out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
>> >>surrounding chairs with it.  A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps
I
>> >>shouldn't take it so seriously.  I tell him to fuck off.
>> >>
>> >>10:15  After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER
seen,""
>> >>I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.
>> >>However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my
left
>> >>eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye.  I am now bleeding

""I'm
>> >>taking this a bit seriously.""
>> >>
>> >>10:22  I am standing in the bathroom peeing.  I'm so drunk I am swaying
and
>> >>grunting.  I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye.  My pants are
>> >>bloody.  I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist.  I
look
>> >>like I should be in an episode of Cops.
>> >>
>> >>10:43  Texas has lost.  I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and
>> >>make my way for the exits.  I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
>> >>samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
>> >>merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
>> >>
>> >>10:59  With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage.  I walk
up

him

truck,

notice

flights,

lift

lined

the

second
>> >>floor.  I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking
facility,
>> >>and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below.  My friend looks at
me

the

>> >>
>> >>12:11  We are moving.  We are out of beer.  I jump from the truck and
go

my

of

doors in

dat

6

Pig, the cart is in fine shape and has been taken to Austin by Chris and is 
being stored at their yard. He advises that it should be retreived promptly, 
theft concerns.

Chad and I have been investigating Trailer costs. 400 to 500, unless we get 
lucky on a used one and they are scarce and we would still pay 350 for it.

Nobby Tires and lift kit can be done at Mission Equiptment for 800. to do it 
ourselves (read chad) will cost at least 500 i guess in parts.

My thoughs. If you are still uncomfortable with transporting in your truck, 
then we need to spend the money to get the trailer and drive as is and built 
a box on the back. If you think it is ok, then consider spending money to do 
tire and suspension job.
I will be in AUstin in a few weeks for depo and will be prepared to bring 
unit home in a) purchased trailer b)rented trailer c)pigs truck.
Need to make a decision here.

Joe: Any word on borrowing friends mothers trailer? Any interest in becoming 
a part owner? Any chance of being able to borrow Kim's grandfather's big ass 
trailer to be pulled by my truck???

Trailer issues per chris, pulling one axle trailer that distance is tricky. 
May wobble if load not well balanced. Probably ride better in back of truck 
or on longer two axle trailer which will track better.

Subject: CPR Texas style


Two cowboys from Texas walk
into a roadhouse to wash the
trail dust from their throats.
They stand at the bar,
drinking a beer and talking
about current cattle prices.
Suddenly, a woman at a nearby
table, who is eating a sandwich,
begins to cough.
After a minute or so, it becomes
apparent that she is in real distress.
One of the cowboys looks at her
and say, ""kin ya swaller?""
The woman shakes her head, no.
""Kin ya breathe?""
The woman begins to turn blue
and shakes her head.
The cowboy walks over to the woman,
lifts up the back of her dress,
yanks down her panties, and slowly
runs his tongue from the back
of her thigh up to the small
of her back.
The woman is so shocked, that
she has a violent spasm and the
obstruction flies out of her mouth.
As she begins to breathe again,
the cowboy walks slowly back to the
bar and takes a drink from his beer.
His partner says,
""Ya know, I'd heard of that there

never seen nobody do it.""",Abusive

April 27th has been selected for work weekend. Chris will be going with his 
highschool buddies (toby, bobby, etc.)
Pig will be drinking Beliken Beer in Belize at the Victoria House,,,,which 
means we will not eat well. We can, however, drink well. Chris I would lay 
your hands on a back up CO2 can. I would hate to have a cold keg and no way 
to get the beer out of it.
Chad says he is in.
I'm in.
Joe hopefully is in.
Chet and Brad you guys are invited to come.

We will be moving the Pig stand to the bone yard location and moving bone 
yard box to the new location selected near the windmill and tank in the half 
section. Moving feed pens as well.
Standard closing and taping of other blinds and pulling motors for summer.

Looking forward to it.

Please confirm if you are IN or OUT.

If so, no need to send out a new contract.  Just send a copy to Dick Forrest.
This came about when Dick Forrest called me last week stating that he could not find a copy of our contract, that's why I had Terry request another copy be sent.

A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak.
After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor replied,
""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka
next to the water glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""  So next
Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon,
he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.  Upon his
return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:

1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy,  
Junior and the Spook.
8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, ""Take this
And eat it for it is my body."" He did not say ""Eat me""
12. The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,""
13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for
the grub, yeah God.
14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St. Peter's,
not a peter pulling contest at! St. Taffy's.


The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings good luck to
everyone who passes it on. The one who breaks the chain will have bad
luck. Do not keep this letter. Do not send money. Just forward it to five of
your friends to whom you wish good luck and a great laugh.
You will see that something good happens to you four days from now if
the chain is not broken.

Subject:	FW: If Santa Answered His Mail Honestly

this is good stuff enjoy


If Santa answered his mail honestly...

Dear Santa I wud like a kool toy space ranjur fer Xmas. Iv ben a gud
boy all yeer.
Yer Frend, BiLLy

Dear Billy, Nice spelling. You're on your way to a career in lawn
care. How about I send you a f....... book so you can learn to read and
write?
I'm giving your older brother the space ranger. At least HE can spell!
Santa


 
Dear Santa, I have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I
ask for is peace and joy in the world for everybody!
Love, Sarah

Dear Sarah, Your parents smoked pot when they had you, didn't they?
Santa


 Dear Santa, I don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas,
I'd like for my mommy and daddy to get back together. Please see what
you can do.
Love,Teddy

Dear Teddy, Look, your dad's banging the babysitter like a screen
door in a hurricane. Do you think he's gonna give that up to come back
to your frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly? It's time to give up
that dream. Let me get you some nice Legos instead. Santa

 Dear Santa, I want a new bike, a Playstation, a train, some G.I.
Joes, a dog, a drum kit, a pony and a tuba.
Love, Francis

Dear Francis, Who names their kid ""Francis"" nowadays? I bet
you're retarded. Santa

 Dear Santa, I left milk and cookies for you under the tree, and I
left carrots for your reindeer outside the back door.
Love, Susan

Dear Susan, Milk gives me the runs and carrots make the deer fart
in my face when riding in the sleigh. You want to do me a favour? Leave
me a bottle of scotch. Santa

 
Dear Santa, What do you do the other 364 days of the year? Are
you busy making toys? Your friend, Thomas

Dear Thomas, All the toys are made in China. I have a condo in Vegas,
where I spend most of my time making low-budget porno films. I unwind
by drinking myself silly and squeezing the asses of cocktail
waitresses while losing money at the craps table. Hey, you wanted to know.
Santa

 
Dear Santa, Do you see us when we're sleeping, do you really know
when we're awake, like in the song?
Love, Jessica

Dear Jessica, Are you really that gullible? Good luck in whatever
you do. I'm skipping your house. Santa

 Dear Santa, I really really want a puppy this year. Please please
please PLEASE PLEASE could I have one?
Timmy

Timmy, That whiney begging shit may work with your folks, but
that crap doesn't work with me. You're getting a sweater again. Santa

 Dearest Santa, We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you
get into our home? Love, Marky

Mark, First, stop calling yourself ""Marky"", that's why you're
getting your ass whipped at school. Second, you don't live in a house,
you live in a low-rent apartment complex. Third, I get inside your pad
just like all the burglars do, through your bedroom window.

A 20 year old gets drunk,some asshole cops treat them like shit and they mouth off to the asshole cops, who being the only ones able to excercise the power trip, get the last word.  Same thing happened to me in Lincoln and I was not a football player.  I had no sanctions and my charges were dropped.  He will miss the opener because he's a player.  When will espn give equal time to all of the other teams who have drunk 20 year olds getting into trouble.

How are you by the way?  I really miss having you around, especially this time of year.  OUT

Maybe if you worked out instead of playing that stupid game of tennis, you wouldn't get 'pansy', err I mean ''Tennis elbow'.  Do I need to remind you that you are under contract and don't get paid for non-softball related injuries. (Alou)  You really need to stop the after hours trading.

hey culo. well, i looked up ""fag"" on websters and it had a picture
of you sucking jerry's balls you homo.  i informed you guys that i
needed to rest my elbow and would not be able to play softball
last week.  that was plenty of time, it wasn't like i bailed out
at the last minute you pillow biter.  if i cannot even hold a
pencil when my tendinitis acts up then i really do not want to
take a chance with it, so deal with it.  even so, i called kevin
after i heard your message (but inadvertently erased it) and told
him i would play if the games were late and you really needed me.
never mind the fact that i had a ton of work to do and i was up
until 3:00 am doing that work; yet i still said that i would go
out there. i applaud you for batting left-handed, since it
couldn't have been any worse than you batting right-handed. as far
as not speaking to me for three days why not make it more?  it
really doesn't bother me.  if you're going to insult me at least
know how to spell my name mr moolknar it's spelled m-i-h-a-l-y.

that could barely run, yet you can't show up or even try to get

showed up and hobbled around the field for us.  I can't walk
without pain in my knee, but I showed up.  I had to catch and bat
left handed cuz I couldn't put any weight on it, but I showed up.

would help the team.  I'm not going to talk to you for a few

I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will ""water out"" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

I am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for western Canada.  We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shut-ins at a dollar.  I am going to put Steve South and Paul Lucci in charge of presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.  What do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.  Is it as simple as gathering and processing?

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."" 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

?????????????PAKISTAN HOLIDAY VACATION 

?????A married couple were on holiday vacation in Pakistan. They were 
?????touring around the marketplace looking 
?????at the goods and such, when they passed this small sandal shop. From 
?????inside they heard a gentleman with a Pakistani accent say, 
?????You foreigners! Come in. Come indo my humble shop."" 

?????So the married couple walked in. The Pakistani man said to them, ""I 
?????have some special sandals I tink you would be interested in. Dey make 
?????you wild at sex like a great desert camel."" 

?????While, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after what 
?????the man claimed, her husband felt he really didn't need them, being 
?????the sex god that he was. 

?????The husband asked the man, ""How could sandals make you into a sex 
?????freak?"" 

?????The Pakistani man replied, ""Just try dem on, Saiheeb."" 

?????The husband, after much badgering from his wife, finally conceded to 
?????try them on. As soon as he slipped them onto his feet, he got this 
?????wild look in his eyes; something his wife hadn't seen in many years-- 
?????raw sexual power. 

?????In the blink of an eye, the husband grabbed the Pakistani man, bent 
?????him over a table and yanked down his 
?????pants. He then ripped down his own pants and grabbed a firm hold of 
?????the Pakistani. 

?????The Pakistani then began screaming, 
?????""YOU HAVE DEM ON DE WRONG FEET!""

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."" 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."" 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

?????????????PAKISTAN HOLIDAY VACATION 

?????A married couple were on holiday vacation in Pakistan. They were 
?????touring around the marketplace looking 
?????at the goods and such, when they passed this small sandal shop. From 
?????inside they heard a gentleman with a Pakistani accent say, 
?????You foreigners! Come in. Come indo my humble shop."" 

?????So the married couple walked in. The Pakistani man said to them, ""I 
?????have some special sandals I tink you would be interested in. Dey make 
?????you wild at sex like a great desert camel."" 

?????While, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after what 
?????the man claimed, her husband felt he really didn't need them, being 
?????the sex god that he was. 

?????The husband asked the man, ""How could sandals make you into a sex 
?????freak?"" 

?????The Pakistani man replied, ""Just try dem on, Saiheeb."" 

?????The husband, after much badgering from his wife, finally conceded to 
?????try them on. As soon as he slipped them onto his feet, he got this 
?????wild look in his eyes; something his wife hadn't seen in many years-- 
?????raw sexual power. 

?????In the blink of an eye, the husband grabbed the Pakistani man, bent 
?????him over a table and yanked down his 
?????pants. He then ripped down his own pants and grabbed a firm hold of 
?????the Pakistani. 

?????The Pakistani then began screaming, 
?????""YOU HAVE DEM ON DE WRONG FEET!""

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."" 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

?????????????PAKISTAN HOLIDAY VACATION 

?????A married couple were on holiday vacation in Pakistan. They were 
?????touring around the marketplace looking 
?????at the goods and such, when they passed this small sandal shop. From 
?????inside they heard a gentleman with a Pakistani accent say, 
?????You foreigners! Come in. Come indo my humble shop."" 

?????So the married couple walked in. The Pakistani man said to them, ""I 
?????have some special sandals I tink you would be interested in. Dey make 
?????you wild at sex like a great desert camel."" 

?????While, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after what 
?????the man claimed, her husband felt he really didn't need them, being 
?????the sex god that he was. 

?????The husband asked the man, ""How could sandals make you into a sex 
?????freak?"" 

?????The Pakistani man replied, ""Just try dem on, Saiheeb."" 

?????The husband, after much badgering from his wife, finally conceded to 
?????try them on. As soon as he slipped them onto his feet, he got this 
?????wild look in his eyes; something his wife hadn't seen in many years-- 
?????raw sexual power. 

?????In the blink of an eye, the husband grabbed the Pakistani man, bent 
?????him over a table and yanked down his 
?????pants. He then ripped down his own pants and grabbed a firm hold of 
?????the Pakistani. 

?????The Pakistani then began screaming, 
?????""YOU HAVE DEM ON DE WRONG FEET!""

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."" 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

For those tired of the usual ""friend"" poems, a touch of truth!


When you are sad,.............I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.
When you are scared,.........I will laugh at you and tease you about it
every chance I get.
When you are worried,.........I will tell you how much worse it could be and
to quit complaining.
When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your
dumb butt.
When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the
porcelain god.
When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt.
This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end.
Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.

Hope it made you laugh - but you know I got your back!!!!!!!!

snake, would you bite someone with an exercise stick?  Sounds like a time

As if you guys needed any tips...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  I wish you were a door so I could bang you all day long.

2.  (Lick finger and wipe on her shirt)  Let's get  you out of these wet
clothes.

3.  Nice legs...what time do they open?

4.  Do you work for UPS? I could have sworn I saw you checking out my
     package.

5.  You've got 206 bones in your body, want one more?

6.  Can I buy you a drink or do you just want the money?

7.  I may not be the best looking guy in here, but I'm the only one
    talking to you.

8.  I'm a bird watcher and I'm looking for a Big Breasted Bed
    Thrasher, have you seen one?

9.  I'm fighting the urge to make you the happiest woman on earth
     tonight.

10.  Wanna play army? I'll lay down and you can blow the hell outta
       me.

11.  I wish you were a Pony Carousel outside Walmart, so could ride
      you all day long for a quarter.

12.  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that was a braille name tag.

13.  I'd really like to see how you look when I'm naked

14.  Is that a ladder in your stockings or the stairway the heaven?

15.  You might not be the best looking girl here, but beauty is only
       a light switch away

16.  Are those real?

17.  You must be the limp doctor because I've got a stiffy.

18.  You can feel the magic between us...No, lower!

19.  I'd walk a million miles for one of your smiles, and even
       farther for that thing you do with your tongue.

20.  Girl, if you were a porch I'd take out all the nails and screw
       ya
21.  If it's true that we are what we eat, then I could be you by

ASK THE FOOL

This weekly e-mail offers answers to questions that perplex most
beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an
investing-related lesson, as well. Enjoy!

-- Q.  What do you think of viaticals as investments?

-- A. Viatical settlements have grown in popularity in recent
years. But they're not without risk and they may make some
people uncomfortable.

Viatical settlements are when a terminally ill person sells his
or her life insurance policy to someone else. Imagine John,
stricken with a fatal form of cancer. He's 36 and is expected to
live only three more years. If he needs cash to pay for medical
bills or just to spend and enjoy, he might sell his life
insurance policy to Jane. If it's set to pay $100,000 on his
death, Jane might pay $66,000 for it. That way he gets a lot of
cash now and Jane expects to get the $100,000 in about three
years. At that rate, she'd be earning roughly a 15 percent
annual return.

There are many risks, though. John may hang on for seven years,
significantly reducing Jane's return. Indeed, a cure for his
cancer might be discovered. John may even outlive Jane! It's
true that these settlements can provide a service for sick
people, but they're not necessarily win-win. The middlemen
arranging these settlements take cuts. Also, if John lives, he's
without his life insurance policy and few insurers will want to
insure him, as he's been so sick recently.

We're uneasy about investing in something that has us rooting
for speedy deaths and against medical breakthroughs. Also, there
have been many instances of fraud with viaticals.

-- Q. What does ""shrinkage"" mean in the business world?

-- A. It refers to the loss of inventory that happens through
usual ways, such as accidental breakage, theft, weather damage,
etc.

area or post your question on the Ask a Foolish Question

INVESTING BASICS - IN THE MARGINS

If you're new to investing, you've probably stared at an income
statement (sometimes called a statement of operations) and
scratched your head, wondering what it's telling you. Let us
help.

First, understand that the income statement summarizes sales and
profits over a period of time. It might cover three months or a
year, for example. It will usually offer information for the
year-ago period as well, so you can compare the two and spot
trends.

Here's a slightly dated but nevertheless interesting example.
Let's look at Eskimo Pie Corp.'s income statement for fiscal
year 1998. At the top, as with every income statement, you'll
find net sales (sometimes called revenues). For Eskimo Pie,
they're $63.5 million.

From now on, as we work down the income statement, various costs
will be subtracted from the revenues, leaving different levels
of profit. The item you'll find just under revenues is ""cost of
goods sold"" (abbreviated as COGS and sometimes called cost of
sales), which represents the cost of producing the products or
services sold. For Eskimo Pie it's $37.4 million. Subtract the
COGS from revenues, and you'll get a gross profit of $26.1
million.

To find the gross profit margin, simply divide the gross profit
by revenues. $26.1 million divided by $63.5 million yields a
gross margin of 41 percent. (Compare results with industry
peers. For example, at a similar time, gross margin was 35
percent for Ben & Jerry's, which has a somewhat different
business model.)

Next, the remaining costs involved in operating the business,
such as support staff salaries, utility bills and advertising
expenses, are subtracted, leaving the operating profit. Eskimo
Pie's operating profit is $1.8 million. Divide this by revenues,
and you get a slim operating margin of 2.8 percent. This reveals
the profitability of the company's principal business. (Ben &
Jerry's: 4.3 percent.)

Finally, after items such as taxes and interest payments are
accounted for, we come to net income, near the bottom of the
statement. Eskimo Pie's is $0.8 million. Divide that by revenues
and you get a net profit margin of 1.3 percent. (Ben & Jerry's:
3 percent.) The last part of the income statement is where the
company divides its net income by shares outstanding, to arrive
at earnings per share (EPS).

That's it!

 Hey Fool! Want to know the SECRET to long-term investing?
 Compounding and dollar-cost averaging! Start investing with
 as little as $20! Just $2.99 per order.
 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196113


ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I want to open a brokerage account, but the firms I called
require between $1,000 and $5,000 upfront, just to open an
account. What can I do?

-- A. Many brokerages don't have minimums. Details about and
ratings for scores of discount brokerages, both traditional and
online, can be found in SmartMoney magazine, the American
Association of Individual Investors Journal and other
periodicals. Online brokerages are also reviewed and rated at
gomez.com.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196114

Note that commissions for discount brokerages have fallen to as
low as $5 or $10 per trade. (And some of them are offering free
trades to those with certain minimum balances.) This is a far
cry from the typical discount commission of $30 to $50 a few
years ago and the hundreds of dollars that some full-service
brokerages will still charge you today.

-- Q. I'm 14 years old. How much risk should I apply to what I'm
investing?

-- A. We love questions like this! If only all 14-year olds were
learning about investing.

Anyone can afford to take on some risk by investing in stocks --
as long as the money won't be withdrawn within the next five or
more years. If the money you're investing is for college, stocks
aren't a good idea, as the market could drop in the short term.
Those investing for the long haul can patiently ride out
downturns. Short-term investors should stick to safer plays,
like money market funds.

You're smart to start young. Let's say you invest $500 and it
earns the average annual market rate of 11 percent. In 30 years,
when you're only 44, it'll become $11,446. Sock it away until
retirement at 65 and it'll be nearly $100,000. Add to it over
the years and you're looking at early retirement!

Got some questions of your own for the Fool? Head to our Help
area or post your question on the Ask a Foolish Question
discussion board.

INVESTING BASICS - CALLING ALL WOMEN

If you know a woman who isn't yet investing, clip out this
article and pass it on to her. She may thank you one day from
the bottom of her wallet.

Many women (and men, too) are steering clear of the stock
market, and they're paying a high price for it. Consider these
facts. Wives tend to be less involved than husbands in household
investing and retirement planning. Most married women outlive
their husbands. Fully 80 percent of all widows in poverty became
poor only after the death of their husbands. In 1992, 87 percent
of the elderly poor in America were women.

If we've now depressed you, hold on. There's good news, too.
More women are investing today than in the past. A 1997 study
commissioned by the National Association of Securities Dealers
found that 47 percent of investors were women, up from 37
percent in 1990.

When women invest, they can do very well. According to recent
National Association of Investors Corp. (NAIC) statistics, the
average annual lifetime return for all-women investment clubs
was 17.9 percent, compared with 15.6 percent for all-men clubs
(in 1997). Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, professors at the
University of California at Davis business school, offer an
explanation. In a 1998 study, they found that men are more
likely than women to be overconfident and to trade frequently.
Single men, for example, traded 67 percent more than single
women, reaping lower returns.

Here are some guidelines for women -- and heck, men --
interested in getting started:

1. Take the time to learn first. Don't jump into any investment
without understanding it and being comfortable with it. Read
""One Up on Wall Street"" by Peter Lynch or our ""You Have More
Than You Think.""
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196117
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196118

2. Don't be afraid to take on some risk. Sticking to low-risk
choices like bonds or money market funds dooms you to lower
returns. As long as you're investing for five to ten or more
years, you can afford to ride out any short-term market
downturns.

3. Consider forming an investment club. Learn how with the NAIC
at better-investing.org.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I'm interested in REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts),
but I don't understand what ""FFO"" refers to. Can you explain?

-- A. REITs look and act much like ordinary stocks, but peek
under their hoods and you'll see a different kind of company.
REITs typically own many properties, such as offices, hotels or
apartments. With most companies, net income is a useful number
to evaluate, reflecting the profits left over from sales after
all expenses have been subtracted. With REITs, though, net
income isn't as meaningful.

According to accounting rules, the value of REIT properties is
decreased over time, with depreciation charged against net
income, reducing it. In reality, however, these properties are
probably not falling in value and may even be appreciating. So a
REIT's net income tends to understate its health. This is why,
with REITs, you should look at the ""funds from operation,"" or
FFO, instead. They ignore the effect of depreciation and other
non-cash charges to help you see a REIT's true performance.

-- Q. I often see S&P futures referred to on CNBC. Can you
explain what futures are and why they're important?

-- A. Futures are typically for commodities like lumber,
soybeans and orange juice. They represent contracts between two
parties to buy or sell a certain amount for a specified price at
a set future date. (Fail to pay attention, and you risk having
to take delivery of truckloads of pork bellies!)

With S&P 500 futures, each day the party who bet wrong is
obligated to pony up cash based on the price of the S&P 500.
Futures are bought by some investors to protect themselves
against unfavorable price swings or by speculators betting on
where the market is going. They can be very risky.

Un-Foolish short-term investors pay a lot of attention to S&P
futures, as they can indicate the market's likely moves before
trading begins for the day. We don't fret about futures, though,
remembering that for most of this century, the S&P 500 has
advanced about 11 percent per year, on average.

_________________________________________________________________


INVESTING BASICS - DEBATING DEBT

Many investors think that debt on a company's balance sheet is a
red flag. In truth, though, debt can be both bad and good.

First, the bad. If a company is saddled with a lot of debt, it's
locked into interest payments that it must make. If it doesn't
have the cash to cover these at any point, it's in deep doodoo.
Many individuals can probably relate to this, having experienced
the dark side of debt when racking up charges on credit cards.

Now, the good. Consider that most people would never be able to
buy their homes without debt. Without car and school loans, many
of us would probably be driving used cars and taking
correspondence courses we found on matchbook covers.

Debt can be a boon for businesses, too. Many great companies,
such as Federal Express and the Walt Disney Co., came to life
because of early loans to their founders. Established companies
can make good use of debt, as well, borrowing to expand
operations and grow business. Interest payments also decrease a
company's taxable income, as they're deductible. Investors
willing to consider companies with debt need to evaluate whether
the debt taken on is manageable and whether the capital raised
and invested is earning more than it costs.

Perhaps you're worried about the debt load of
Fingernail-on-Blackboard Car Alarm Co. (ticker: AIEEE). Glance
at the notes in the annual report and you may find that the
effective interest rate for its debt is just 5 percent. If AIEEE
is putting the borrowed funds to work earning say, 8 percent,
then things aren't so bad.

When companies need money, they typically have two main choices:
They can issue more stock or debt. Issuing stock can dilute the
value of existing shares. Issuing debt can sometimes be more
efficient, as its after-tax cost can be much cheaper than
equity. All things being equal, though, we prefer to see little
debt on a balance sheet.

Companies that can grow without using debt or issuing extra
stock are in a more powerful position than other firms. Still,
you needn't balk at the first sight of debt. Just evaluate it
carefully.

 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D168091


ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. What's a mock portfolio?

-- A. Mock portfolios are a great tool for people new to
investing and for those trying out new investing methods. You
simply go through all the motions of investing, stopping short
of actually plunking down your hard-earned cash. Research some
companies, decide which ones you'd buy, and then set up a
pretend portfolio, either on paper or online. (Many websites
offer online portfolio tracking -- and we're one of them.) Keep
track of details such as when you ""bought"" the shares and at
what price. Then track your performance, aiming to beat the
market.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D168092

-- Q. I've heard you sing the praises of the Standard & Poor's
(S&P) 500 index fund on your radio show, but I'm wondering what
other indexes are out there.

-- A. A bunch of indexes exist, with each one representing a
particular group of companies. We'll highlight just a few. The
most famous one is the Dow Jones Industrial Index, which
includes 30 flagship American giants, such as Exxon, Wal-Mart,
Merck, Coca-Cola and Microsoft. The S&P 500 also focuses on
large companies, including 500 of America's biggest and best.

The Russell 3000 Index includes 3,000 of the largest U.S.
companies based on market capitalization (current share price
multiplied by number of shares outstanding). These 3,000
constitute about 98 percent of the U.S. market. For a measure of
small-cap companies, look to the Russell 2000. It's composed of
the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000. The Wilshire
5000 is just about the broadest index of American companies. It
began with 5,000 but now contains more than 7,000.

There are many more indexes. Some are for international regions
such as Latin America or the Far East. Others address sectors
such as utilities, semiconductors, the Internet and fried
chicken. (Just kidding about the chicken.)

INVESTING BASICS - RULES FOR REVOLUTIONARIES

In order to help readers find books that offer valuable business
insights coupled with sparkling writing, we launched a monthly
book award last year, called The Jester Award. The first winner
of the Jester was Guy Kawasaki's new book, ""Rules for
Revolutionaries"" (HarperBusiness, $15). In it, he lays out some
bold guidelines for those who want to bring about business
revolutions. Here are a few:
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D168095

1. ""Don't worry, be crappy."" Yes, you read that right. It's
Kawasaki's inimitable way of reminding us that it can take
almost forever to perfect something, and that it's often best to
release a not-quite-perfect product and then work on improving
its next generation. He illustrates this with the 1984 Macintosh
computer, which was shipped in a less-than-perfect
configuration: only 128K of RAM, no hard drive, no
documentation, and so on. Waiting to perfect the product would
have meant giving the competition an edge and losing the
confidence of software developers.

2. ""Eat your own dog food."" This sounds crazy, but think about
it. By using your own company's products or services, you'll
understand what the customer experience is like and you'll be
able to flag problems quickly. Forrest Mars Sr., the man who
built Mars Inc., did taste his own company's dog food
(literally), a practice that continues today at the company.
Kawasaki offers the example of Gillette, which maintains a
shaving laboratory where 300 employees per day come in unshaven
and test the company's and competitors' products. Similarly,
bicycle manufacturer Cannondale encourages its employees to
commute by Cannondale bikes, so that they can offer feedback on
products.

3. ""Eat like a bird, poop like an elephant."" (Really, we're not
making this stuff up!) Birds actually eat a lot -- sometimes 50
percent of their weight every day. And elephants can poop 165
pounds per day. The idea here is that you should soak up as much
information as you can find and then share it.

If you're looking for a well-written, engaging book to help you
stay on the cutting edge of the best thinking and writing on
personal finance and investing, keep an eye out for Jester Award
winners. To nominate any book for a Jester Award, drop an e-mail

Subject: something like this
Date: Mon, 17 Sep 2001 23:22:02 EDT

If I were President George W. Bush's Speech Writer. By Mitchell R. Robb

Good evening my fellow Americans.
First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New York and all
Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You can rest assured that
anything and everything that can be done to assure the safety of our country
will be done.
This is the greatest country in the world and we will get through this
trying
time.
Now is the time for all people to set aside our petty differences and
show the world that no one or nothing can destroy the fortitude of the
American people.
To the people responsible for today's tragedy, I say this: Are you fucking
kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped too tight?
Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not know who you are fucking
with? Americans are so hungry to kill, that we shoot at each other every
day.
We will relish that opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you
forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started fucking
around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over in Japan? We
slapped
them all over the Pacific and roasted about 2 million of them in their own
back yard. That's what we in America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen
Texas
on a map? Ever wonder why it's so big? Because  we wanted it that way,
Mexico
started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our lawns. England?
We
sent them packing. Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good 'ole
USA. The only reason he got away the first time is because it's too hard to
shoot someone when you're doubled over laughing at them. Our soldiers aren't
trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now he couldn't stop a pack of
cub scouts from taking over his shitty little country. Trust us, Afghanistan
will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden.
There's not a hole deep enough or a mountain high enough that's going to
keep
your camel riding asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that
harbors him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he was
there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that have pissed us
off
in the past. This is America. We kick ass. This is what we do. Go ahead and
laugh now, but the Tomahawks are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.
God bless America!

YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED=20

Q. Should an investor be concerned if one or more officers of a=20
company sell shares of its stock that they own?=20

A. Although it may look like a red flag, it isn't necessarily=20
one. Many executives today receive a large part of their=20
compensation in stock options. So when they have to buy a house=20
or make a college tuition payment, they sell some shares. They=20
may also be trying to diversify their investments, not wanting=20
to have too much of their portfolio in one company.=20

On the other hand, one insider (or many insiders) selling might=20
indeed signal a loss of faith in the company. If you're worried,=20
you might want to take a closer look at the company's recent=20
performance. Perhaps fire up your computer and see what people=20
interested in the company are saying about it online, on message=20
boards.=20


Q. What does ""insured by FDIC"" mean, and what does it NOT=20
insure?=20

A. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) insures our=20
traditional checking, savings and money market accounts (as well=20
as CDs) held at banks and thrifts for up to $100,000. Note,=20
though, that the FDIC does not cover stocks, bonds, mutual=20
funds, life insurance policies, annuities and the like. For=20
these, check with your financial service company to see what=20
kind of insurance may be provided.=20

Learn more about the FDIC at their website. To make sure you are=20
stashing your short-term cash in the most profitable place,=20
check out our Savings Center.=20
http://www.fdic.gov/
http://www.fool.com/savings/savings.htm

-----------------------------------------------------------------
THIS WEEK'S LESSON=20

OPTIONS 101
Imagine you want to invest in Legume Gas Works (ticker: BEANZ).=20
You can buy shares the usual way -- or you can buy options.=20
Here's an introduction to options.=20

There are two main types: calls and puts. A call gives you the=20
right to buy a set amount of shares at a set price within a=20
certain period of time (often just a few months). For this=20
right, you pay a price premium. Puts are similar, but give you=20
the right to sell shares.=20

If Legume is selling for $50 per share and you expect it to=20
rise, you could buy ""October $55"" call options for it. Let's say=20
you snap up calls to buy 100 shares, for $6 each, or a total of=20
$600. If just before your options expire Legume is selling for=20
$65 per share, you can exercise your options and buy 100 shares=20
for $5,500. Then you can keep them or sell them for $6,500.=20

If you sell, you make a $1,000 profit, right? Nope. You paid=20
$600, remember? So your profit is down to $400 -- less, when you=20
account for trading commissions.=20

Options are risky. If Legume stays at $55 or falls, your $600=20
would be entirely lost. It has to top $61 per share -- $55 plus=20
$6 -- by October for you to profit.=20

Some folks like options because of the leverage they offer. They=20
point out that if you only have $1,000, you can only buy 20=20
shares of a $50 stock. Alternatively, that $1,000 could buy many=20
more options tied to hundreds of shares of stock. True enough.=20
With options, though, timing is critical. If things don't go=20
your way in a short-term time frame, your option will expire=20
worthless.=20

Most options expire unexercised and worthless. (Those most=20
likely to profit from options are the ones who ""write"" or sell=20
the options.) That's because options are really about buying=20
time, not stocks. If you're sure that Legume's stock will rise,=20
you're probably best off buying its stock. Then if it doesn't=20
behave as you expected it to, you can either sell the shares or=20
hang on patiently.=20

Options are not for beginning investors, and even more advanced=20
investors might consider steering clear.=20

You can read more about options at this Motley Fool FAQ.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. What's a mock portfolio?

-- A. Mock portfolios are a great tool for people new to
investing and for those trying out new investing methods. You
simply go through all the motions of investing, stopping short
of actually plunking down your hard-earned cash. Research some
companies, decide which ones you'd buy, and then set up a
pretend portfolio, either on paper or online. (Many websites
offer online portfolio tracking -- and we're one of them.) Keep
track of details such as when you ""bought"" the shares and at
what price. Then track your performance, aiming to beat the
market.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D168092

-- Q. I've heard you sing the praises of the Standard & Poor's
(S&P) 500 index fund on your radio show, but I'm wondering what
other indexes are out there.

-- A. A bunch of indexes exist, with each one representing a
particular group of companies. We'll highlight just a few. The
most famous one is the Dow Jones Industrial Index, which
includes 30 flagship American giants, such as Exxon, Wal-Mart,
Merck, Coca-Cola and Microsoft. The S&P 500 also focuses on
large companies, including 500 of America's biggest and best.

The Russell 3000 Index includes 3,000 of the largest U.S.
companies based on market capitalization (current share price
multiplied by number of shares outstanding). These 3,000
constitute about 98 percent of the U.S. market. For a measure of
small-cap companies, look to the Russell 2000. It's composed of
the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000. The Wilshire
5000 is just about the broadest index of American companies. It
began with 5,000 but now contains more than 7,000.

There are many more indexes. Some are for international regions
such as Latin America or the Far East. Others address sectors
such as utilities, semiconductors, the Internet and fried
chicken. (Just kidding about the chicken.)

INVESTING BASICS - RULES FOR REVOLUTIONARIES

In order to help readers find books that offer valuable business
insights coupled with sparkling writing, we launched a monthly
book award last year, called The Jester Award. The first winner
of the Jester was Guy Kawasaki's new book, ""Rules for
Revolutionaries"" (HarperBusiness, $15). In it, he lays out some
bold guidelines for those who want to bring about business
revolutions. Here are a few:
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D168095

1. ""Don't worry, be crappy."" Yes, you read that right. It's
Kawasaki's inimitable way of reminding us that it can take
almost forever to perfect something, and that it's often best to
release a not-quite-perfect product and then work on improving
its next generation. He illustrates this with the 1984 Macintosh
computer, which was shipped in a less-than-perfect
configuration: only 128K of RAM, no hard drive, no
documentation, and so on. Waiting to perfect the product would
have meant giving the competition an edge and losing the
confidence of software developers.

2. ""Eat your own dog food."" This sounds crazy, but think about
it. By using your own company's products or services, you'll
understand what the customer experience is like and you'll be
able to flag problems quickly. Forrest Mars Sr., the man who
built Mars Inc., did taste his own company's dog food
(literally), a practice that continues today at the company.
Kawasaki offers the example of Gillette, which maintains a
shaving laboratory where 300 employees per day come in unshaven
and test the company's and competitors' products. Similarly,
bicycle manufacturer Cannondale encourages its employees to
commute by Cannondale bikes, so that they can offer feedback on
products.

3. ""Eat like a bird, poop like an elephant."" (Really, we're not
making this stuff up!) Birds actually eat a lot -- sometimes 50
percent of their weight every day. And elephants can poop 165
pounds per day. The idea here is that you should soak up as much
information as you can find and then share it.

If you're looking for a well-written, engaging book to help you
stay on the cutting edge of the best thinking and writing on
personal finance and investing, keep an eye out for Jester Award
winners. To nominate any book for a Jester Award, drop an e-mail
to: Jester@fool.com.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I'm interested in REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts),
but I don't understand what ""FFO"" refers to. Can you explain?

-- A. REITs look and act much like ordinary stocks, but peek
under their hoods and you'll see a different kind of company.
REITs typically own many properties, such as offices, hotels or
apartments. With most companies, net income is a useful number
to evaluate, reflecting the profits left over from sales after
all expenses have been subtracted. With REITs, though, net
income isn't as meaningful.

According to accounting rules, the value of REIT properties is
decreased over time, with depreciation charged against net
income, reducing it. In reality, however, these properties are
probably not falling in value and may even be appreciating. So a
REIT's net income tends to understate its health. This is why,
with REITs, you should look at the ""funds from operation,"" or
FFO, instead. They ignore the effect of depreciation and other
non-cash charges to help you see a REIT's true performance.

-- Q. I often see S&P futures referred to on CNBC. Can you
explain what futures are and why they're important?

-- A. Futures are typically for commodities like lumber,
soybeans and orange juice. They represent contracts between two
parties to buy or sell a certain amount for a specified price at
a set future date. (Fail to pay attention, and you risk having
to take delivery of truckloads of pork bellies!)

With S&P 500 futures, each day the party who bet wrong is
obligated to pony up cash based on the price of the S&P 500.
Futures are bought by some investors to protect themselves
against unfavorable price swings or by speculators betting on
where the market is going. They can be very risky.

Un-Foolish short-term investors pay a lot of attention to S&P
futures, as they can indicate the market's likely moves before
trading begins for the day. We don't fret about futures, though,
remembering that for most of this century, the S&P 500 has
advanced about 11 percent per year, on average.

INVESTING BASICS - DEBATING DEBT

Many investors think that debt on a company's balance sheet is a
red flag. In truth, though, debt can be both bad and good.

First, the bad. If a company is saddled with a lot of debt, it's
locked into interest payments that it must make. If it doesn't
have the cash to cover these at any point, it's in deep doodoo.
Many individuals can probably relate to this, having experienced
the dark side of debt when racking up charges on credit cards.

Now, the good. Consider that most people would never be able to
buy their homes without debt. Without car and school loans, many
of us would probably be driving used cars and taking
correspondence courses we found on matchbook covers.

Debt can be a boon for businesses, too. Many great companies,
such as Federal Express and the Walt Disney Co., came to life
because of early loans to their founders. Established companies
can make good use of debt, as well, borrowing to expand
operations and grow business. Interest payments also decrease a
company's taxable income, as they're deductible. Investors
willing to consider companies with debt need to evaluate whether
the debt taken on is manageable and whether the capital raised
and invested is earning more than it costs.

Perhaps you're worried about the debt load of
Fingernail-on-Blackboard Car Alarm Co. (ticker: AIEEE). Glance
at the notes in the annual report and you may find that the
effective interest rate for its debt is just 5 percent. If AIEEE
is putting the borrowed funds to work earning say, 8 percent,
then things aren't so bad.

When companies need money, they typically have two main choices:
They can issue more stock or debt. Issuing stock can dilute the
value of existing shares. Issuing debt can sometimes be more
efficient, as its after-tax cost can be much cheaper than
equity. All things being equal, though, we prefer to see little
debt on a balance sheet.

Companies that can grow without using debt or issuing extra
stock are in a more powerful position than other firms. Still,
you needn't balk at the first sight of debt. Just evaluate it
carefully.

 Hey Fool! Want to know the SECRET to long-term investing?
 Compounding and dollar-cost averaging! Start investing with
 as little as $20! Just $2.99 per order.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I want to open a brokerage account, but the firms I called
require between $1,000 and $5,000 upfront, just to open an
account. What can I do?

-- A. Many brokerages don't have minimums. Details about and
ratings for scores of discount brokerages, both traditional and
online, can be found in SmartMoney magazine, the American
Association of Individual Investors Journal and other
periodicals. Online brokerages are also reviewed and rated at
gomez.com.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196114

Note that commissions for discount brokerages have fallen to as
low as $5 or $10 per trade. (And some of them are offering free
trades to those with certain minimum balances.) This is a far
cry from the typical discount commission of $30 to $50 a few
years ago and the hundreds of dollars that some full-service
brokerages will still charge you today.

-- Q. I'm 14 years old. How much risk should I apply to what I'm
investing?

-- A. We love questions like this! If only all 14-year olds were
learning about investing.

Anyone can afford to take on some risk by investing in stocks --
as long as the money won't be withdrawn within the next five or
more years. If the money you're investing is for college, stocks
aren't a good idea, as the market could drop in the short term.
Those investing for the long haul can patiently ride out
downturns. Short-term investors should stick to safer plays,
like money market funds.

You're smart to start young. Let's say you invest $500 and it
earns the average annual market rate of 11 percent. In 30 years,
when you're only 44, it'll become $11,446. Sock it away until
retirement at 65 and it'll be nearly $100,000. Add to it over
the years and you're looking at early retirement!

area or post your question on the Ask a Foolish Question

INVESTING BASICS - CALLING ALL WOMEN

If you know a woman who isn't yet investing, clip out this
article and pass it on to her. She may thank you one day from
the bottom of her wallet.

Many women (and men, too) are steering clear of the stock
market, and they're paying a high price for it. Consider these
facts. Wives tend to be less involved than husbands in household
investing and retirement planning. Most married women outlive
their husbands. Fully 80 percent of all widows in poverty became
poor only after the death of their husbands. In 1992, 87 percent
of the elderly poor in America were women.

If we've now depressed you, hold on. There's good news, too.
More women are investing today than in the past. A 1997 study
commissioned by the National Association of Securities Dealers
found that 47 percent of investors were women, up from 37
percent in 1990.

When women invest, they can do very well. According to recent
National Association of Investors Corp. (NAIC) statistics, the
average annual lifetime return for all-women investment clubs
was 17.9 percent, compared with 15.6 percent for all-men clubs
(in 1997). Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, professors at the
University of California at Davis business school, offer an
explanation. In a 1998 study, they found that men are more
likely than women to be overconfident and to trade frequently.
Single men, for example, traded 67 percent more than single
women, reaping lower returns.

Here are some guidelines for women -- and heck, men --
interested in getting started:

1. Take the time to learn first. Don't jump into any investment
without understanding it and being comfortable with it. Read
""One Up on Wall Street"" by Peter Lynch or our ""You Have More
Than You Think.""
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196117
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196118

2. Don't be afraid to take on some risk. Sticking to low-risk
choices like bonds or money market funds dooms you to lower
returns. As long as you're investing for five to ten or more
years, you can afford to ride out any short-term market
downturns.

3. Consider forming an investment club. Learn how with the NAIC
at better-investing.org.

ASK THE FOOL

This weekly e-mail offers answers to questions that perplex most
beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an
investing-related lesson, as well. Enjoy!

-- Q.  What do you think of viaticals as investments?

-- A. Viatical settlements have grown in popularity in recent
years. But they're not without risk and they may make some
people uncomfortable.

Viatical settlements are when a terminally ill person sells his
or her life insurance policy to someone else. Imagine John,
stricken with a fatal form of cancer. He's 36 and is expected to
live only three more years. If he needs cash to pay for medical
bills or just to spend and enjoy, he might sell his life
insurance policy to Jane. If it's set to pay $100,000 on his
death, Jane might pay $66,000 for it. That way he gets a lot of
cash now and Jane expects to get the $100,000 in about three
years. At that rate, she'd be earning roughly a 15 percent
annual return.

There are many risks, though. John may hang on for seven years,
significantly reducing Jane's return. Indeed, a cure for his
cancer might be discovered. John may even outlive Jane! It's
true that these settlements can provide a service for sick
people, but they're not necessarily win-win. The middlemen
arranging these settlements take cuts. Also, if John lives, he's
without his life insurance policy and few insurers will want to
insure him, as he's been so sick recently.

We're uneasy about investing in something that has us rooting
for speedy deaths and against medical breakthroughs. Also, there
have been many instances of fraud with viaticals.

-- Q. What does ""shrinkage"" mean in the business world?

-- A. It refers to the loss of inventory that happens through
usual ways, such as accidental breakage, theft, weather damage,
etc.

INVESTING BASICS - IN THE MARGINS

If you're new to investing, you've probably stared at an income
statement (sometimes called a statement of operations) and
scratched your head, wondering what it's telling you. Let us
help.

First, understand that the income statement summarizes sales and
profits over a period of time. It might cover three months or a
year, for example. It will usually offer information for the
year-ago period as well, so you can compare the two and spot
trends.

Here's a slightly dated but nevertheless interesting example.
Let's look at Eskimo Pie Corp.'s income statement for fiscal
year 1998. At the top, as with every income statement, you'll
find net sales (sometimes called revenues). For Eskimo Pie,
they're $63.5 million.

From now on, as we work down the income statement, various costs
will be subtracted from the revenues, leaving different levels
of profit. The item you'll find just under revenues is ""cost of
goods sold"" (abbreviated as COGS and sometimes called cost of
sales), which represents the cost of producing the products or
services sold. For Eskimo Pie it's $37.4 million. Subtract the
COGS from revenues, and you'll get a gross profit of $26.1
million.

To find the gross profit margin, simply divide the gross profit
by revenues. $26.1 million divided by $63.5 million yields a
gross margin of 41 percent. (Compare results with industry
peers. For example, at a similar time, gross margin was 35
percent for Ben & Jerry's, which has a somewhat different
business model.)

Next, the remaining costs involved in operating the business,
such as support staff salaries, utility bills and advertising
expenses, are subtracted, leaving the operating profit. Eskimo
Pie's operating profit is $1.8 million. Divide this by revenues,
and you get a slim operating margin of 2.8 percent. This reveals
the profitability of the company's principal business. (Ben &
Jerry's: 4.3 percent.)

Finally, after items such as taxes and interest payments are
accounted for, we come to net income, near the bottom of the
statement. Eskimo Pie's is $0.8 million. Divide that by revenues
and you get a net profit margin of 1.3 percent. (Ben & Jerry's:
3 percent.) The last part of the income statement is where the
company divides its net income by shares outstanding, to arrive
at earnings per share (EPS).

That's it!

ASK THE FOOL

This weekly e-mail offers answers to questions that perplex most
beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an
investing-related lesson, as well. Enjoy!

-- Q.  What do you think of viaticals as investments?

-- A. Viatical settlements have grown in popularity in recent
years. But they're not without risk and they may make some
people uncomfortable.

Viatical settlements are when a terminally ill person sells his
or her life insurance policy to someone else. Imagine John,
stricken with a fatal form of cancer. He's 36 and is expected to
live only three more years. If he needs cash to pay for medical
bills or just to spend and enjoy, he might sell his life
insurance policy to Jane. If it's set to pay $100,000 on his
death, Jane might pay $66,000 for it. That way he gets a lot of
cash now and Jane expects to get the $100,000 in about three
years. At that rate, she'd be earning roughly a 15 percent
annual return.

There are many risks, though. John may hang on for seven years,
significantly reducing Jane's return. Indeed, a cure for his
cancer might be discovered. John may even outlive Jane! It's
true that these settlements can provide a service for sick
people, but they're not necessarily win-win. The middlemen
arranging these settlements take cuts. Also, if John lives, he's
without his life insurance policy and few insurers will want to
insure him, as he's been so sick recently.

We're uneasy about investing in something that has us rooting
for speedy deaths and against medical breakthroughs. Also, there
have been many instances of fraud with viaticals.

-- Q. What does ""shrinkage"" mean in the business world?

-- A. It refers to the loss of inventory that happens through
usual ways, such as accidental breakage, theft, weather damage,
etc.

INVESTING BASICS - IN THE MARGINS

If you're new to investing, you've probably stared at an income
statement (sometimes called a statement of operations) and
scratched your head, wondering what it's telling you. Let us
help.

First, understand that the income statement summarizes sales and
profits over a period of time. It might cover three months or a
year, for example. It will usually offer information for the
year-ago period as well, so you can compare the two and spot
trends.

Here's a slightly dated but nevertheless interesting example.
Let's look at Eskimo Pie Corp.'s income statement for fiscal
year 1998. At the top, as with every income statement, you'll
find net sales (sometimes called revenues). For Eskimo Pie,
they're $63.5 million.

From now on, as we work down the income statement, various costs
will be subtracted from the revenues, leaving different levels
of profit. The item you'll find just under revenues is ""cost of
goods sold"" (abbreviated as COGS and sometimes called cost of
sales), which represents the cost of producing the products or
services sold. For Eskimo Pie it's $37.4 million. Subtract the
COGS from revenues, and you'll get a gross profit of $26.1
million.

To find the gross profit margin, simply divide the gross profit
by revenues. $26.1 million divided by $63.5 million yields a
gross margin of 41 percent. (Compare results with industry
peers. For example, at a similar time, gross margin was 35
percent for Ben & Jerry's, which has a somewhat different
business model.)

Next, the remaining costs involved in operating the business,
such as support staff salaries, utility bills and advertising
expenses, are subtracted, leaving the operating profit. Eskimo
Pie's operating profit is $1.8 million. Divide this by revenues,
and you get a slim operating margin of 2.8 percent. This reveals
the profitability of the company's principal business. (Ben &
Jerry's: 4.3 percent.)

Finally, after items such as taxes and interest payments are
accounted for, we come to net income, near the bottom of the
statement. Eskimo Pie's is $0.8 million. Divide that by revenues
and you get a net profit margin of 1.3 percent. (Ben & Jerry's:
3 percent.) The last part of the income statement is where the
company divides its net income by shares outstanding, to arrive
at earnings per share (EPS).

That's it!

 as little as $20! Just $2.99 per order.
 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196113


ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I want to open a brokerage account, but the firms I called
require between $1,000 and $5,000 upfront, just to open an
account. What can I do?

-- A. Many brokerages don't have minimums. Details about and
ratings for scores of discount brokerages, both traditional and
online, can be found in SmartMoney magazine, the American
Association of Individual Investors Journal and other
periodicals. Online brokerages are also reviewed and rated at
gomez.com.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196114

Note that commissions for discount brokerages have fallen to as
low as $5 or $10 per trade. (And some of them are offering free
trades to those with certain minimum balances.) This is a far
cry from the typical discount commission of $30 to $50 a few
years ago and the hundreds of dollars that some full-service
brokerages will still charge you today.

-- Q. I'm 14 years old. How much risk should I apply to what I'm
investing?

-- A. We love questions like this! If only all 14-year olds were
learning about investing.

Anyone can afford to take on some risk by investing in stocks --
as long as the money won't be withdrawn within the next five or
more years. If the money you're investing is for college, stocks
aren't a good idea, as the market could drop in the short term.
Those investing for the long haul can patiently ride out
downturns. Short-term investors should stick to safer plays,
like money market funds.

You're smart to start young. Let's say you invest $500 and it
earns the average annual market rate of 11 percent. In 30 years,
when you're only 44, it'll become $11,446. Sock it away until
retirement at 65 and it'll be nearly $100,000. Add to it over
the years and you're looking at early retirement!

Got some questions of your own for the Fool? Head to our Help
area or post your question on the Ask a Foolish Question
discussion board.

INVESTING BASICS - CALLING ALL WOMEN

If you know a woman who isn't yet investing, clip out this
article and pass it on to her. She may thank you one day from
the bottom of her wallet.

Many women (and men, too) are steering clear of the stock
market, and they're paying a high price for it. Consider these
facts. Wives tend to be less involved than husbands in household
investing and retirement planning. Most married women outlive
their husbands. Fully 80 percent of all widows in poverty became
poor only after the death of their husbands. In 1992, 87 percent
of the elderly poor in America were women.

If we've now depressed you, hold on. There's good news, too.
More women are investing today than in the past. A 1997 study
commissioned by the National Association of Securities Dealers
found that 47 percent of investors were women, up from 37
percent in 1990.

When women invest, they can do very well. According to recent
National Association of Investors Corp. (NAIC) statistics, the
average annual lifetime return for all-women investment clubs
was 17.9 percent, compared with 15.6 percent for all-men clubs
(in 1997). Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, professors at the
University of California at Davis business school, offer an
explanation. In a 1998 study, they found that men are more
likely than women to be overconfident and to trade frequently.
Single men, for example, traded 67 percent more than single
women, reaping lower returns.

Here are some guidelines for women -- and heck, men --
interested in getting started:

1. Take the time to learn first. Don't jump into any investment
without understanding it and being comfortable with it. Read
""One Up on Wall Street"" by Peter Lynch or our ""You Have More
Than You Think.""
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196117
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196118

2. Don't be afraid to take on some risk. Sticking to low-risk
choices like bonds or money market funds dooms you to lower
returns. As long as you're investing for five to ten or more
years, you can afford to ride out any short-term market
downturns.

3. Consider forming an investment club. Learn how with the NAIC
at better-investing.org.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I'm interested in REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts),
but I don't understand what ""FFO"" refers to. Can you explain?

-- A. REITs look and act much like ordinary stocks, but peek
under their hoods and you'll see a different kind of company.
REITs typically own many properties, such as offices, hotels or
apartments. With most companies, net income is a useful number
to evaluate, reflecting the profits left over from sales after
all expenses have been subtracted. With REITs, though, net
income isn't as meaningful.

According to accounting rules, the value of REIT properties is
decreased over time, with depreciation charged against net
income, reducing it. In reality, however, these properties are
probably not falling in value and may even be appreciating. So a
REIT's net income tends to understate its health. This is why,
with REITs, you should look at the ""funds from operation,"" or
FFO, instead. They ignore the effect of depreciation and other
non-cash charges to help you see a REIT's true performance.

-- Q. I often see S&P futures referred to on CNBC. Can you
explain what futures are and why they're important?

-- A. Futures are typically for commodities like lumber,
soybeans and orange juice. They represent contracts between two
parties to buy or sell a certain amount for a specified price at
a set future date. (Fail to pay attention, and you risk having
to take delivery of truckloads of pork bellies!)

With S&P 500 futures, each day the party who bet wrong is
obligated to pony up cash based on the price of the S&P 500.
Futures are bought by some investors to protect themselves
against unfavorable price swings or by speculators betting on
where the market is going. They can be very risky.

Un-Foolish short-term investors pay a lot of attention to S&P
futures, as they can indicate the market's likely moves before
trading begins for the day. We don't fret about futures, though,
remembering that for most of this century, the S&P 500 has
advanced about 11 percent per year, on average.

INVESTING BASICS - DEBATING DEBT

Many investors think that debt on a company's balance sheet is a
red flag. In truth, though, debt can be both bad and good.

First, the bad. If a company is saddled with a lot of debt, it's
locked into interest payments that it must make. If it doesn't
have the cash to cover these at any point, it's in deep doodoo.
Many individuals can probably relate to this, having experienced
the dark side of debt when racking up charges on credit cards.

Now, the good. Consider that most people would never be able to
buy their homes without debt. Without car and school loans, many
of us would probably be driving used cars and taking
correspondence courses we found on matchbook covers.

Debt can be a boon for businesses, too. Many great companies,
such as Federal Express and the Walt Disney Co., came to life
because of early loans to their founders. Established companies
can make good use of debt, as well, borrowing to expand
operations and grow business. Interest payments also decrease a
company's taxable income, as they're deductible. Investors
willing to consider companies with debt need to evaluate whether
the debt taken on is manageable and whether the capital raised
and invested is earning more than it costs.

Perhaps you're worried about the debt load of
Fingernail-on-Blackboard Car Alarm Co. (ticker: AIEEE). Glance
at the notes in the annual report and you may find that the
effective interest rate for its debt is just 5 percent. If AIEEE
is putting the borrowed funds to work earning say, 8 percent,
then things aren't so bad.

When companies need money, they typically have two main choices:
They can issue more stock or debt. Issuing stock can dilute the
value of existing shares. Issuing debt can sometimes be more
efficient, as its after-tax cost can be much cheaper than
equity. All things being equal, though, we prefer to see little
debt on a balance sheet.

Companies that can grow without using debt or issuing extra
stock are in a more powerful position than other firms. Still,
you needn't balk at the first sight of debt. Just evaluate it
carefully.

 http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D168091


ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. What's a mock portfolio?

-- A. Mock portfolios are a great tool for people new to
investing and for those trying out new investing methods. You
simply go through all the motions of investing, stopping short
of actually plunking down your hard-earned cash. Research some
companies, decide which ones you'd buy, and then set up a
pretend portfolio, either on paper or online. (Many websites
offer online portfolio tracking -- and we're one of them.) Keep
track of details such as when you ""bought"" the shares and at
what price. Then track your performance, aiming to beat the
market.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D168092

-- Q. I've heard you sing the praises of the Standard & Poor's
(S&P) 500 index fund on your radio show, but I'm wondering what
other indexes are out there.

-- A. A bunch of indexes exist, with each one representing a
particular group of companies. We'll highlight just a few. The
most famous one is the Dow Jones Industrial Index, which
includes 30 flagship American giants, such as Exxon, Wal-Mart,
Merck, Coca-Cola and Microsoft. The S&P 500 also focuses on
large companies, including 500 of America's biggest and best.

The Russell 3000 Index includes 3,000 of the largest U.S.
companies based on market capitalization (current share price
multiplied by number of shares outstanding). These 3,000
constitute about 98 percent of the U.S. market. For a measure of
small-cap companies, look to the Russell 2000. It's composed of
the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000. The Wilshire
5000 is just about the broadest index of American companies. It
began with 5,000 but now contains more than 7,000.

There are many more indexes. Some are for international regions
such as Latin America or the Far East. Others address sectors
such as utilities, semiconductors, the Internet and fried
chicken. (Just kidding about the chicken.)

INVESTING BASICS - RULES FOR REVOLUTIONARIES

In order to help readers find books that offer valuable business
insights coupled with sparkling writing, we launched a monthly
book award last year, called The Jester Award. The first winner
of the Jester was Guy Kawasaki's new book, ""Rules for
Revolutionaries"" (HarperBusiness, $15). In it, he lays out some
bold guidelines for those who want to bring about business
revolutions. Here are a few:
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D168095

1. ""Don't worry, be crappy."" Yes, you read that right. It's
Kawasaki's inimitable way of reminding us that it can take
almost forever to perfect something, and that it's often best to
release a not-quite-perfect product and then work on improving
its next generation. He illustrates this with the 1984 Macintosh
computer, which was shipped in a less-than-perfect
configuration: only 128K of RAM, no hard drive, no
documentation, and so on. Waiting to perfect the product would
have meant giving the competition an edge and losing the
confidence of software developers.

2. ""Eat your own dog food."" This sounds crazy, but think about
it. By using your own company's products or services, you'll
understand what the customer experience is like and you'll be
able to flag problems quickly. Forrest Mars Sr., the man who
built Mars Inc., did taste his own company's dog food
(literally), a practice that continues today at the company.
Kawasaki offers the example of Gillette, which maintains a
shaving laboratory where 300 employees per day come in unshaven
and test the company's and competitors' products. Similarly,
bicycle manufacturer Cannondale encourages its employees to
commute by Cannondale bikes, so that they can offer feedback on
products.

3. ""Eat like a bird, poop like an elephant."" (Really, we're not
making this stuff up!) Birds actually eat a lot -- sometimes 50
percent of their weight every day. And elephants can poop 165
pounds per day. The idea here is that you should soak up as much
information as you can find and then share it.

If you're looking for a well-written, engaging book to help you
stay on the cutting edge of the best thinking and writing on
personal finance and investing, keep an eye out for Jester Award
winners. To nominate any book for a Jester Award, drop an e-mail
to: Jester@fool.com.

If I were President George W. Bush's Speech Writer. By Mitchell R. Robb

Good evening my fellow Americans.
First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New York and all
Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You can rest assured that
anything and everything that can be done to assure the safety of our country
will be done.
This is the greatest country in the world and we will get through this
trying
time.
Now is the time for all people to set aside our petty differences and
show the world that no one or nothing can destroy the fortitude of the
American people.
To the people responsible for today's tragedy, I say this: Are you fucking
kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped too tight?
Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not know who you are fucking
with? Americans are so hungry to kill, that we shoot at each other every
day.
We will relish that opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you
forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started fucking
around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over in Japan? We
slapped
them all over the Pacific and roasted about 2 million of them in their own
back yard. That's what we in America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen
Texas
on a map? Ever wonder why it's so big? Because  we wanted it that way,
Mexico
started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our lawns. England?
We
sent them packing. Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good 'ole
USA. The only reason he got away the first time is because it's too hard to
shoot someone when you're doubled over laughing at them. Our soldiers aren't
trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now he couldn't stop a pack of
cub scouts from taking over his shitty little country. Trust us, Afghanistan
will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden.
There's not a hole deep enough or a mountain high enough that's going to
keep
your camel riding asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that
harbors him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he was
there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that have pissed us
off
in the past. This is America. We kick ass. This is what we do. Go ahead and
laugh now, but the Tomahawks are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.
God bless America!

To the people responsible for today's tragedy, I say this: Are you fucking
kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped too tight?
Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not know who you are fucking
with? Americans are so hungry to kill, that we shoot at each other every
day.
We will relish that opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you
forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started fucking
around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over in Japan? We
slapped
them all over the Pacific and roasted about 2 million of them in their own
back yard. That's what we in America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen
Texas
on a map? Ever wonder why it's so big? Because  we wanted it that way,
Mexico
started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our lawns. England?
We
sent them packing. Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good 'ole
USA. The only reason he got away the first time is because it's too hard to
shoot someone when you're doubled over laughing at them. Our soldiers aren't
trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now he couldn't stop a pack of
cub scouts from taking over his shitty little country. Trust us, Afghanistan
will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden.
There's not a hole deep enough or a mountain high enough that's going to
keep
your camel riding asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that
harbors him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he was
there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that have pissed us
off
in the past. This is America. We kick ass. This is what we do. Go ahead and
laugh now, but the Tomahawks are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.
God bless America!

 I included a copy of the Berg anti-trust and unfair competition
complaint filed by Tom Girardi and others in Los Angeles.  Tom Girardi is
the single best plaintiff's lawyer in southern California.  You may recall
his results against PG&E, Lockheed etc. where recovered billions of dollars.
He is well funded and has really good lawyers that work for him. He is
reputed to have close associations with many state court judges in Los
Angeles.

 Both Dick Odom and Michael Molland have been opposite Tom Girardi
for other clients.  Dick represented Roberts & Stevens in a complicated
securities case Fightertown v. Roberts & Stevens  that was tried for 8
weeks.   Tom Girardi posted $320M as damages in the case.  He received a
verdict of $7.0M which was eliminated by Dick's motion for JNOV.  Dick is
one of the very few trial lawyers that have gone head to head with Tom in
significant trial and won.  Dick was recently retained in another case where
Tom Girardi is the plaintiff's lawyer.  Apparently, we knew somebody who
happened to be with Tom Girardi when he received Brobeck's appearance.  His
comment was something to the effect of ""Oh shit. Not those bastards again.""

 Not many defendants have the courage to take a case where Girardi is
the plaintiff's counsel to trial.  Very few of the companies that have taken
him to trial have won.

 Mike Molland has also had several cases opposite Tom Girardi where
Michael represented Browning Ferris Industries as its lead trial lawyer in
the mid 1990s in the serial litigation that arose from the waste disposal
crisis  in Los Angeles County during that time. Girardi's firm sued BFI in
those and other cases during that time.  Michael was able to get BFI
dismissed from all but one of those cases early in the process. The other
case was stayed.

 I know we did not discuss these capabilities when you and Jim were
in San Francisco --in large part, because we did not have the Berg complaint
in hand at the time.  If excelr is considering lining up local counsel in Los
Angeles in the event that it is brought into the Berg case, I hope that you
will consider Dick.

set aside Ralph Ellison to send a brief missive to all y'all in the hopes
that it may atone for anything bizarre which may have occurred in the most
recent communique.  i vaguely recall some coherency at the beginning, but by
four thirty in the morn God only knows what was written.



mother are you listening to that tape?



not a whole lot to report on the itinerary front, though i hope for a
gathering on either Easter weekend or the one after.  does that present a
problem for anyone?  let me know por favor and be quick about it - tickets
muy inflexible will be purchased as soon as i hear from a woman in ye olde
boston towne.



wrote said woman a love letter the other day - nay, the other week as it
took about five revisions - and just now my heart is in my throat as we are
waiting for the reply.  never, never reread a love letter - how could what
must surely be the #1 rule of writing those things have been unknown to me?



upon recollection it has occurred to me that my older male siblings did not
learn me jack shit about the amorous side of life - pitching woo and goin'
courting.  thanks for nada, boys - your collective inattention left me in
the rather hapless position of having to make a study of mack daddy murry
trying to smooth talk danna, and strangely enough it was none other than the
Paternal Unit who imparted the most influence on me.  so basically that
letter reads like pops talking to Arthur and borrows heavily from the time
he tried to talk my ass into going to the palo pinto county prom with candy
hodgkins.



makes us just about cringe out loud even fourteen years removed, that memory
does.  yuck.



well next month am headed to guam for a few days of fun in the sun with an
ozzie mate and a new yorker.  not the most exotic locale, but should be
packed with enough randy nubile nipponese lasses to bring out the sexual
Tyrannosaurus in yours truly.  yeah baby!



so sad about tom landry, but not quite as sad as watching phil collins make
a laughingstock of himself in that absurd super bowl halftime show.  john,
you used to make excuses for him, but i will stomach them no more!



by the way, has anyone actually received an email from the Great She-
Elephant, or does she just read them?  since when did the path of passivity
suit you best, camille-san?  for pete's sake turn off the petula clark
record, stop watching the stock market channel as if something immediately
discernible is about to happen, stub out the ciggie and give a holler!



well there is a whole lot more to say but i reckon it just might be better
done in a matter of weeks in person, face to face, mano a mano

and soul to soul (SRV!)   and so it is until then, sans the comfort of the
bosom of my clan, that i remain much like the proverbial dog without a bone,
the gook without a bowl of rice, chico without the man and a pimp without
his bitches.  see y'all soon - miss y'all heaps

Subject: Fred and Marilyn Promis vs. NEPCO, LSP, LSP-Kendall, NRG and
Granite Power Partners 


ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION; PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

Tom and Mike:

As you may know, NEPCO and the project Owners are named in a personal injury
lawsuit that was served on NEPCO earlier this month in Cook County,
Illinois.  I tender the case by letter to Dick Corp for their defense and
indemnity since it involved one their employees who broke his leg on the
jobsite in Kendall, Illinois.  I cited paragraph 4 (b) and (d) of the JVA as
my authority for shifting the risk to Dick, however was silent on Paragraph
11 and 19 which actually says we should have purchased a GL policy for the
JV to protect the JV and its partners.  As a cost saving measure agreed by
the JV partners, no policy was purchase because each Dick and NEPCO would
rely on the GL policy of their own (Dick's and excelr's) to protect
themselves against third party claims. Paragraph 19 is an indemnity which
states the JV partners share risk 50/50 without respect to who is at fault
except for willful actions.  It also states the JV will indemnify the JV
members, which only works if the JV had purchased a GL policy and in the
absence of a GL policy then the intent would be that each party will utilize
the others GL policy and share in the deductible cost.  Dick has responded
in writing and said it will defend and indemnity NEPCO through its GL policy
(Travelers) but says the JV partners must share in their $250,000
deductible, or $125K per partner.  That hurts, but not as bad as if this
were handled by excelr's policy which has a self insured deductible of $2
Million.

In the end, I agree to some extent with Dick's response for pure third party
claims, but I have some trouble with the concept of claims coming from their
own employees of which they would have immunity from suit under the workers
compensation act.  Dick pays up to it's cap on liability under the WC act
and then theoretically has 50% deductible liability under the GL policy for
claims against the other JV partner.  Had this not been a JV relationship,
we would have had Dick paying all of the defense and indemnity as a
subcontractor.  The JVA is silent on this split in liability for claims by
either parties' own employees, however, I look back to the paragraphs I
cited to Roger Peters (Par. 4 (b) and (d)) and they say with respect to
subcontracts, of which Dick and NEPCO were expected to perform their
respective scopes of work under (see 4 (b)), each such subcontract shall
oblige the subcontractor to indemnify the JV and each of the parties from
and against all expense, liability and claims resulting from its
construction/engineering work.  This language would say that Dick should
take 100% of the claim.  

The bottom line, the JVA is vague in respect to claims by its own employees.
If this were the only claim, I would say lets share the loss because the
benefit and exposure flows both ways.  In reality though, most if not all of
the claims will come from construction workers (Dick employees).  So sharing
the loss is not reasonable especially since the Travelers lawyer has said
the common practice of Union hired employees in the Chicago area is to bring
numerous accident injury claims against owners and GCs as the project winds
down.  He said to expect more claims like this because he sees this on other
Dick jobs.

Gail and Bob,  This message is more for informational purposes since the
claim has been accepted by Dick Corp although Travelers did not afford me
much selection of counsel since they went ahead and assigned it to a Chicago
lawyer, Chic Marasa.  His number and address is:  (312) 345-7229, Law
offices of Chic Marasa, One East Wacker Drive, Suite 3450, Chicago, Illinois
60601.  We may want to have one of you monitor the outside lawyer hired by
Travelers and make sure our interests are served.  I sent the complaint and
my tender letter to Richard Sanders on August 10th.  Gail,  I spoke to Chic
and he sounds nice, single and available if you are interested. Juuust
kidding.

could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no 
limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what 
capacity it can sell as firm.  Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be 
less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.  If you think this 
passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it.  

My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as ""firm"" or ""interruptible"" 
since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except 
to assure us over the phone that it is firm!  I'd like to check to see if PNM 
is comfortable with all this before we file anything.

2920,scott-s/_sent_mail/317.,<8542895.1075846738967.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Lorraine:  here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my 
comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a 
draft to send around to the usual suspects.  

1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs 
of the acquired capacity.  

 -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue 
associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to 
other shippers.  
 - Net costs will be separately recorded.

2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access 
to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to 
limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to 
other pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain 
the ""no tying"" part).

3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  

 - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction
 - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or 
advantage to any affiliated entity.

4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's 
customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?  

 - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods 
in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM 
shippers should be minimal.  
 - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly 
preferential treatment of TW.

5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing 
open access operations?  

 - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to 
transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco 
Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with 
TW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's 
tariff.  
 - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS 
(right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on 
TW's system.  
 - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be 
able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service 
agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with 
PNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of 
likely scenarios.

6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new 
facilities?  

 - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan 
Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of 
prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the 
PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives 
available to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to 
transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to 
delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding 
the San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by 
effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's 
system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable 
both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

                              *An Army grunt stands in the rain with a 35 
pound pack on his back, 15 lb. weapon in hand, after having

with a 45 lb. pack on his back, weapon in hand, after having
                              jumped from an airplane and marched 18 miles, 
and says with a smile, ""This is good shit!"" 

                              *A Navy SEAL lies in the mud, 55 LB pack on his 
back, weapon in hand, after swimming 10 miles to shore,
                              crawling through a swamp and marching 25 miles 
at night past the enemy positions, says with a grin, ""This

have a sneaking suspicion it's not going to happen- call me a cynic, but i'm 
getting bad vibes, n'est pas?? damn!? claudia is driving me nuts- and i've 
had this horrible weighty sense of deja vu- couldn't figure it out til last 
week marci mentioned something that triggered?the memory: i was, of course 
bitching about how sick i am of her badgering and lecturing me to 'party' w/ 
her at her shady discos, and marci laughingly says it's prob b/c she's 
secretly a lesbian, and is trying to hit on me.....aughhhhh1? she's kim 
barton!? although i'm not saying for sure i think kim's a lesbo (yeah, right- 
she's just nuts, at the very least....) and i k! now claudia's straight- but 
it's those boarding school kids- clingy and desperate for attention, but 
soooooo much more sophisticated and wordly than just a silly little 
conservative texas girl who has had the same friends for 15 years- basically 
just fell off the potato truck...i'm soooooo naive.? it's annoying how she 
manipultes her provenence when it's convenient- she's sooooooo texas when 
it's cute to be wholesome and outdoorsy and fun, but she'd totally 
'international' when it comes to interacting with other cultures, and how 
many 'experiences' she's had.? ohhh, she's seen fire and she's seen rain, 
alright.....just want to say to her that just b/c daddy sent her away with a 
whole bunch of other spoiled brats that never learned to socialize and behave 
properly b/c they didn't HAVE to- daddy  and 'the family' would always get 
her out of any sticky situation......maybe she's not quite as worldly and 
fabulous as she thinks.? i can not TELL you how many 'lectur! es' she's given 
me about how i'm not social enough, and if i would just let her take me under 
her wing, she could really help me grow up ( can you HEAR the 
condescention?)? i sit there and just nod dumbly, then? am fuming and it's 
all i can do to walk away w/ out slapping the haughty, self-satisfied 
expression off her face.? would like then to tell her that i've probably been 
doing more than she has been socially, but she wouldn't know b/c i'm not 
doing them w/ her...and wouldn't want to invite her along.? it would kill 
her!? she really thinks i go to the library at night, or turn my ringer off 
and read at 9:30.? bless her heart- it she weren't so pushy (my GOD- do you 
remember how bad kim was our sophmore and jr year?? constantly calling and 
putting me on guilt trips, harassing me to spend the night, and i'd have to 
finally give up, and throw her a bone and do it just to placate her?)? i'd 
just tell her i'm hanging out w/ other people! , but don't want her to go 
nuts!? well, enough venting for now....did tell her i'd be in california til 
dec 18th so she wouldn't call me- either in london or houston.? i am really 
sneaky......anyways- hope all is well- wish you were coming w/ kates- it'd be

Subject: Hangover Classification


Hey JB - You don't how any of these feel do you?
Later - Jenny

Hangover Classification

1 Star Hangover:
 No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere
 disco nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy. Be  glad
 that you are able to function relatively well. However, you are still
parched. You can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way. Even
vegetarians are craving a steakbomb and a side of gravy fries from any
truck stop USA.

2 Star Hangover:
No pain. Something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have
the attention span and mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you =
chug
to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut, which =
is craving rootie tootie fresh and fruity pancake breakfast from IHOP. =
Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels and even though you have a =
nice demeanor about the office, you are costing your employer valuable =
money because all you really can handle is surfing internet porn and =
writing junk e-mails.

3 Star Hangover:
Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely a space shot
and so not productive. Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her =
perfume
reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends =
after the bouncer 86'd you at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now =
if you were in your bed with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub watching =
the E! fashion awards. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 3 =
Snapples and a liter of diet coke- yet you haven't peed once.

4 Star Hangover:
Life sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or
else you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being
late and has given you a lecture for wreaking of booze. You wore nice
clothes but that can't hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial
spot shaving, (girls, it looks like you put your make-up on while
riding the bumper cars) your teeth have sweaters, your eyes look like
one big vein and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the
class picture of Revere High, '76. You would shoot your mother for one =
or all
of the following: 1. The clock to strike 6pm. 2. The entire appetizer =
list from      TGIFridays or 3. A time machine so you could go back and =
NOT have gone out the night before.

5 Star Hangover:
aka Dante's 4th Circle of Hell. You have a second heartbeat in your
head which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the next
cube. Vodka vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy.
You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from
brushing your teeth. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva
so your tongue is suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the =
last
of the moisture left in your body. Death seems pretty good right now. =
Your
boss doesn't even get mad at you and your co-workers think that your dog
just died because you look so pathetic. You should have called in sick
because let's face it, all you can manage to do is bitch about your =
state-
which is a mystery to you because you definitely don't remember who you =
were
with,  where you were, what you drank and why there is a stranger still
sleeping in your bed, unaccompanied, at your house. The only thing you =
can do is
smoke a bong hit and pass out. It's when you wake up a few hours later
with a lesser star hangover that you eat a large pizza, an order of Kung =
Pao
Chicken, a ham and cheese omelet and a batch of rice krispie treats.

I have not heard from you in quite a while.

So what have you been up to and how is excelr treating you. when are you going 
to London.

All is well here...well work is very stressful, but it's cool and i do love 
my job despite all the bitching i do.
It's just a lot of strss.
I've made some big move and actually won a big project over a VP.
You will be seing me soon in Houston. (can't tell you more)

Anyway
Partying like crazy..that's all I do..girls..girls...and more girls...i can't 
even remember all their names OUPS>
Still in love with Shannon, and no she is still not in my life and yes she is 
still in Houston...I hope life helps a little on this one.
Partying..like 4-5 times a week..
But above all, working out like an animal. It's been really good and i'm 
starting to look like i did at excelr...a machine.
Running a lot and working out...

So what is up with you?

morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.

1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not

over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

this is funny


HAVING A BAD DAY? 

For all of you who occasionally have a really bad day  when you just need to 
take it out on  someone!!!? Don't take that bad day out on someone you know,  
take it out on someone you DON'T know!!! 

Now get this.? I was sitting at my desk, when I  remembered a phone call I 
had 
to make. I  found the number and dialed it. 

A man answered nicely saying, ""Hello?"" 

I politely said, ""This is Patrick Hannifin, could I  please speak to Robin 
Carter?"" 

Suddenly the phone was slammed down on me!? I  couldn't believe that anyone 
could be that  rude. 

I tracked down Robin's correct number and called  her.? I had transposed the 
last two  digits incorrectly. 

After I hung up with Robin, I spotted the wrong  number still lying there on 
my  desk. 

I decided to call it again.  

When the same person once more answered, I  yelled? ""You're a jackass!"" and 
hung  up. 

Next to his phone number I wrote the word?  ""jackass,"" and put it in my desk 
drawer. 

Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills, or  had a really bad day, I'd 
call him  up. 

He'd answer, and I'd yell, ""You're a jackass!"". It  would always cheer me up. 

Later in the year the phone company introduced caller  ID.? This was a real 
disappointment for  me, I would have to stop calling the jackass.  

Then one day I had an idea.? I dialed his  number, then heard his 
voice,""Hello."" 

I made up a name.? ""Hi, this is Mike Smith with  the sales office of the 
telephone company and  I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with our 
caller ID program?"" 

He went, ""No!"" and slammed the phone down.? I  quickly called him back and 
said, ""That's  because you're a jackass!"" 

[Keep reading, it gets better.] 

An old lady at the mall really took her time pulling  out of the parking 
place. I didn't think she  was ever going to leave. 

Finally, she got the car in reverse and she began to  move ... very slowly 
backing out of the  slot. 

I backed up a little more to give her plenty of room  to pull out. 

Great, I thought, she's finally leaving. 

All of a sudden this black Camaro comes flying up the  parking aisle in the 
wrong direction and  pulls into her space. 

I started honking my horn and yelling, ""You can't  just do that, Buddy. I was 
here  first!"" 

The guy climbed out of his Camaro completely ignoring  me.? He walked toward 
the mall as if he didn't even hear me.  

I thought to myself, this guy's a jackass, there sure  a lot of jackasses in 
this world. 

Then I noticed he had a ""For Sale"" sign in the back  window of his car. 

I wrote down the number. Then I hunted for another  place to park. 

A couple of days later, I'm at home sitting at my  desk.? I had just gotten 
off the phone  after calling my jackass friend and yelling, ""You're a 
jackass!""? (It's  
really easy to call him now since I have his number  on speed dial.) 

I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black  Camaro lying on my desk 
and thought I'd  better call this guy, too. 

After a couple rings someone answered the phone and  said, ""Hello.""? I said, 
""Is this the man  with the black Camaro for sale?"" 

""Yes, it is."" 

""Can you tell me where I can see it?"" 

""Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th street.? It's a  yellow house and the car's 
parked right out  front."" 

I said, ""What's your name?""  

""My name is Don Hansen.""  

""When's a good time to catch you, Don?"" 

""I'm home in the evenings.""  

""Listen Don, can I tell you something?"" 

""Yes."" 

""Don, you're a jackass!""? And I slammed the  phone down. 

After I hung up I added Don Hansen's number to my  speed dialer. 

For a while things, seemed to be going better for  me. 

Now when I had a problem I had two jackasses to  call. 

Then, after several months of calling the jackasses  and hanging up on them, 
it just wasn't as  enjoyable as it used to be. 

I gave the problem some serious thought and came up  with a solution: 

First, I had my phone dial Jackass #1. 

A man answered nicely saying,""Hello."" 

I yelled ""You're a jackass!"", but I didn't hang  up. 

The jackass said, ""Are you still there?"" 

I said, ""Yeah."" 

He said, ""Stop calling me.""  

I said, ""No."" 

He said, ""What's your name, Pal?"" 

I said, ""Don Hansen.""  

He said ""Where do you live?""  

""1802 West 34th Street.? It's a yellow house and  my black Camaro's parked 
out 
front."" 

""I'm coming over right now, Don.? You'd better  start saying your prayers."" 

""Yeah, like I'm really scared, Jackass!"" and I hung  up. 

Then I called Jackass #2.? He answered,  ""Hello."" 

I said, ""Hello, Jackass!""  

He said, ""If I ever find out who you  are..."" 

""You'll what?"" 

""I'll kick your butt.""  

""Well, here's your chance.? I'm coming over  right now, Jackass!"" 

And I hung up. 

Then I picked up the phone and called the  police. 

I told them I was at 1802 West 34th Street and that I  was going to kill my 
gay lover as soon as he  got home. 

Another quick call to Channel 13 about the gang war  going on down W. 34th 
Street. 

After that I climbed into my car and headed over to  34th Street to watch the 
whole  thing. 

Glorious!? Watching two Jackasses kicking the  crap out of each other in 
front 
of 6 squad  cars, a police helicopter, and channel 13 news cameras!!! 

It was one of the greatest experiences of my  life! 

Names changed to protect the guilty. 


O.K. Now stop laughing and crying, people are going to think you are a nut; 
especially the people on the other side of your wall.

could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no 
limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what 
capacity it can sell as firm.  Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be 
less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.  If you think this 
passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it.  

My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as ""firm"" or ""interruptible"" 
since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except 
to assure us over the phone that it is firm!  I'd like to check to see if PNM 
is comfortable with all this before we file anything.

Words by Lorenz Hart and Music by Richard Rodgers (1930)

Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
Gosh, how they weigh me down
Ten cents a dance, pansies and rough guys
Tough guys who tear my gown

Seven to midnight I hear drums
Loudly the saxophone blows
Trumpets are tearing my eardrums
Customers crush my toes

Sometimes I think I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket
Come on, big boy, ten cents a dance!

2951,scott-s/all_documents/93.,<25828964.1075846658717.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Lorraine:  here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my 
comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a 
draft to send around to the usual suspects.  

1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs 
of the acquired capacity.  

 -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue 
associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to 
other shippers.  
 - Net costs will be separately recorded.

2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access 
to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to 
limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to 
other pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain 
the ""no tying"" part).

3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  

 - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction
 - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or 
advantage to any affiliated entity.

4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's 
customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?  

 - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods 
in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM 
shippers should be minimal.  
 - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly 
preferential treatment of TW.

5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing 
open access operations?  

 - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to 
transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco 
Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with 
TW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's 
tariff.  
 - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS 
(right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on 
TW's system.  
 - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be 
able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service 
agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with 
PNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of 
likely scenarios.

6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new 
facilities?  

 - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan 
Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of 
prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the 
PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives 
available to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to 
transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to 
delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding 
the San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by 
effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's 
system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable 
both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently.

Hey JB - You don't how any of these feel do you?
Later - Jenny

Hangover Classification

1 Star Hangover:
 No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere
 disco nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy. Be  glad
 that you are able to function relatively well. However, you are still
parched. You can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way. Even
vegetarians are craving a steakbomb and a side of gravy fries from any
truck stop USA.

2 Star Hangover:
No pain. Something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have
the attention span and mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you =
chug
to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut, which =
is craving rootie tootie fresh and fruity pancake breakfast from IHOP. =
Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels and even though you have a =
nice demeanor about the office, you are costing your employer valuable =
money because all you really can handle is surfing internet porn and =
writing junk e-mails.

3 Star Hangover:
Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely a space shot
and so not productive. Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her =
perfume
reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends =
after the bouncer 86'd you at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now =
if you were in your bed with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub watching =
the E! fashion awards. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 3 =
Snapples and a liter of diet coke- yet you haven't peed once.

4 Star Hangover:
Life sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or
else you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being
late and has given you a lecture for wreaking of booze. You wore nice
clothes but that can't hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial
spot shaving, (girls, it looks like you put your make-up on while
riding the bumper cars) your teeth have sweaters, your eyes look like
one big vein and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the
class picture of Revere High, '76. You would shoot your mother for one =
or all
of the following: 1. The clock to strike 6pm. 2. The entire appetizer =
list from      TGIFridays or 3. A time machine so you could go back and =
NOT have gone out the night before.

5 Star Hangover:
aka Dante's 4th Circle of Hell. You have a second heartbeat in your
head which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the next
cube. Vodka vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy.
You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from
brushing your teeth. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva
so your tongue is suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the =
last
of the moisture left in your body. Death seems pretty good right now. =
Your
boss doesn't even get mad at you and your co-workers think that your dog
just died because you look so pathetic. You should have called in sick
because let's face it, all you can manage to do is bitch about your =
state-
which is a mystery to you because you definitely don't remember who you =
were
with,  where you were, what you drank and why there is a stranger still
sleeping in your bed, unaccompanied, at your house. The only thing you =
can do is
smoke a bong hit and pass out. It's when you wake up a few hours later
with a lesser star hangover that you eat a large pizza, an order of Kung =
Pao
Chicken, a ham and cheese omelet and a batch of rice krispie treats.

whole bunch of other spoiled brats that never learned to socialize and behave 
properly b/c they didn't HAVE to- daddy  and 'the family' would always get 
her out of any sticky situation......maybe she's not quite as worldly and 
fabulous as she thinks.? i can not TELL you how many 'lectur! es' she's given 
me about how i'm not social enough, and if i would just let her take me under 
her wing, she could really help me grow up ( can you HEAR the 
condescention?)? i sit there and just nod dumbly, then? am fuming and it's 
all i can do to walk away w/ out slapping the haughty, self-satisfied 
expression off her face.? would like then to tell her that i've probably been 
doing more than she has been socially, but she wouldn't know b/c i'm not 
doing them w/ her...and wouldn't want to invite her along.? it would kill 
her!? she really thinks i go to the library at night, or turn my ringer off 
and read at 9:30.? bless her heart- it she weren't so pushy (my GOD- do you 
remember how bad kim was our sophmore and jr year?? constantly calling and 
putting me on guilt trips, harassing me to spend the night, and i'd have to 
finally give up, and throw her a bone and do it just to placate her?)? i'd 
just tell her i'm hanging out w/ other people! , but don't want her to go 
nuts!? well, enough venting for now....did tell her i'd be in california til 
dec 18th so she wouldn't call me- either in london or houston.? i am really 
sneaky......anyways- hope all is well- wish you were coming w/ kates- it'd be

could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no 
limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what 
capacity it can sell as firm.  Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be 
less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.  If you think this 
passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it.  

My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as ""firm"" or ""interruptible"" 
since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except 
to assure us over the phone that it is firm!  I'd like to check to see if PNM 
is comfortable with all this before we file anything.

Ruth Etting
Words by Lorenz Hart and Music by Richard Rodgers (1930)

Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
Gosh, how they weigh me down
Ten cents a dance, pansies and rough guys
Tough guys who tear my gown

Seven to midnight I hear drums
Loudly the saxophone blows
Trumpets are tearing my eardrums
Customers crush my toes

Sometimes I think I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket

2960,scott-s/discussion_threads/70.,<16530256.1075846684224.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Lorraine:  here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my 
comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a 
draft to send around to the usual suspects.  

1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs 
of the acquired capacity.  

 -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue 
associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to 
other shippers.  
 - Net costs will be separately recorded.

2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access 
to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to 
limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to 
other pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain 
the ""no tying"" part).

3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  

 - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction
 - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or 
advantage to any affiliated entity.

4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's 
customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?  

 - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods 
in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM 
shippers should be minimal.  
 - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly 
preferential treatment of TW.

5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing 
open access operations?  

 - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to 
transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco 
Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with 
TW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's 
tariff.  
 - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS 
(right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on 
TW's system.  
 - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be 
able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service 
agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with 
PNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of 
likely scenarios.

6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new 
facilities?  

 - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan 
Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of 
prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the 
PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives 
available to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to 
transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to 
delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding 
the San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by 
effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's 
system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable 
both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently.

HAVING A BAD DAY? 

For all of you who occasionally have a really bad day  when you just need to 
take it out on  someone!!!? Don't take that bad day out on someone you know,  
take it out on someone you DON'T know!!! 

Now get this.? I was sitting at my desk, when I  remembered a phone call I 
had 
to make. I  found the number and dialed it. 

A man answered nicely saying, ""Hello?"" 

I politely said, ""This is Patrick Hannifin, could I  please speak to Robin 
Carter?"" 

Suddenly the phone was slammed down on me!? I  couldn't believe that anyone 
could be that  rude. 

I tracked down Robin's correct number and called  her.? I had transposed the 
last two  digits incorrectly. 

After I hung up with Robin, I spotted the wrong  number still lying there on 
my  desk. 

I decided to call it again.  

When the same person once more answered, I  yelled? ""You're a jackass!"" and 
hung  up. 

Next to his phone number I wrote the word?  ""jackass,"" and put it in my desk 
drawer. 

Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills, or  had a really bad day, I'd 
call him  up. 

He'd answer, and I'd yell, ""You're a jackass!"". It  would always cheer me up. 

Later in the year the phone company introduced caller  ID.? This was a real 
disappointment for  me, I would have to stop calling the jackass.  

Then one day I had an idea.? I dialed his  number, then heard his 
voice,""Hello."" 

I made up a name.? ""Hi, this is Mike Smith with  the sales office of the 
telephone company and  I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with our 
caller ID program?"" 

He went, ""No!"" and slammed the phone down.? I  quickly called him back and 
said, ""That's  because you're a jackass!"" 

[Keep reading, it gets better.] 

An old lady at the mall really took her time pulling  out of the parking 
place. I didn't think she  was ever going to leave. 

Finally, she got the car in reverse and she began to  move ... very slowly 
backing out of the  slot. 

I backed up a little more to give her plenty of room  to pull out. 

Great, I thought, she's finally leaving. 

All of a sudden this black Camaro comes flying up the  parking aisle in the 
wrong direction and  pulls into her space. 

I started honking my horn and yelling, ""You can't  just do that, Buddy. I was 
here  first!"" 

The guy climbed out of his Camaro completely ignoring  me.? He walked toward 
the mall as if he didn't even hear me.  

I thought to myself, this guy's a jackass, there sure  a lot of jackasses in 
this world. 

Then I noticed he had a ""For Sale"" sign in the back  window of his car. 

I wrote down the number. Then I hunted for another  place to park. 

A couple of days later, I'm at home sitting at my  desk.? I had just gotten 
off the phone  after calling my jackass friend and yelling, ""You're a 
jackass!""? (It's  
really easy to call him now since I have his number  on speed dial.) 

I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black  Camaro lying on my desk 
and thought I'd  better call this guy, too. 

After a couple rings someone answered the phone and  said, ""Hello.""? I said, 
""Is this the man  with the black Camaro for sale?"" 

""Yes, it is."" 

""Can you tell me where I can see it?"" 

""Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th street.? It's a  yellow house and the car's 
parked right out  front."" 

I said, ""What's your name?""  

""My name is Don Hansen.""  

""When's a good time to catch you, Don?"" 

""I'm home in the evenings.""  

""Listen Don, can I tell you something?"" 

""Yes."" 

""Don, you're a jackass!""? And I slammed the  phone down. 

After I hung up I added Don Hansen's number to my  speed dialer. 

For a while things, seemed to be going better for  me. 

Now when I had a problem I had two jackasses to  call. 

Then, after several months of calling the jackasses  and hanging up on them, 
it just wasn't as  enjoyable as it used to be. 

I gave the problem some serious thought and came up  with a solution: 

First, I had my phone dial Jackass #1. 

A man answered nicely saying,""Hello."" 

I yelled ""You're a jackass!"", but I didn't hang  up. 

The jackass said, ""Are you still there?"" 

I said, ""Yeah."" 

He said, ""Stop calling me.""  

I said, ""No."" 

He said, ""What's your name, Pal?"" 

I said, ""Don Hansen.""  

He said ""Where do you live?""  

""1802 West 34th Street.? It's a yellow house and  my black Camaro's parked 
out 
front."" 

""I'm coming over right now, Don.? You'd better  start saying your prayers."" 

""Yeah, like I'm really scared, Jackass!"" and I hung  up. 

Then I called Jackass #2.? He answered,  ""Hello."" 

I said, ""Hello, Jackass!""  

He said, ""If I ever find out who you  are..."" 

""You'll what?"" 

""I'll kick your butt.""  

""Well, here's your chance.? I'm coming over  right now, Jackass!"" 

And I hung up. 

Then I picked up the phone and called the  police. 

I told them I was at 1802 West 34th Street and that I  was going to kill my 
gay lover as soon as he  got home. 

Another quick call to Channel 13 about the gang war  going on down W. 34th 
Street. 

After that I climbed into my car and headed over to  34th Street to watch the 
whole  thing. 

Glorious!? Watching two Jackasses kicking the  crap out of each other in 
front 
of 6 squad  cars, a police helicopter, and channel 13 news cameras!!! 

It was one of the greatest experiences of my  life! 

Names changed to protect the guilty. 


O.K. Now stop laughing and crying, people are going to think you are a nut; 
especially the people on the other side of your wall.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

IT'S BEAUTIFUL WOMAN  MONTH & TAG YOU'RE IT! 

[IMAGE]
Well, it is and that  means you and me. I'm supposed to send this to
[IMAGE]
FIVE BEAUTIFUL  WOMEN, and you are one of them!!! 
Facts on Figures; 
There are 3  billion women who don't look like supermodels and 
only eight who do.  
Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14.[IMAGE]
If Barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due 
to  her proportions. 
The average woman weighs 144 lb. and wears between a  12-14. 
One out of every four college aged women has an eating!  disorder.
[IMAGE]
The models in the  magazines are airbrushed -- not perfect! 
A psychological study in 1995  found that three minutes spent 
looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of  women to feel depressed, 
guilty, and shameful.   
Models  twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
[IMAGE]
Today they weigh 23%  less.
[IMAGE]
~Beauty of a Woman~  
The beauty  of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, 
The  figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. 
The  beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes, 
Because that  is the doorway to her heart, 
The place where love resides.  
The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole,  
But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.  
It is the caring that she lovingly gives,  
The passion that she shows. 
The beauty  of a woman 
With passing years -- only  grows.
[IMAGE]
An English professor  wrote the words, ""Woman without her man is nothing,"" on the blackboard and  directed the students to punctuate it correctly. 
The men wrote: ""Woman,  without her man, is nothing."" 
The women wrote: ""Woman! Without her, man is  nothing."" 
The Images of Mother 
4 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mommy can  do anything! 
8 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mom knows a lot! A whole  lot!
[IMAGE]
12 YEARS OF AGE ~ My  Mother doesn't really know quite everything. 
14 YEARS  OF AGE ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either. 
16  YEARS OF AGE ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned. 
18  YEARS OF AGE ~ That old woman? She's way out of date! 
25  YEARS OF AGE ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.  
35 YEARS OF AGE ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.  
45 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about  it? 
65 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.  
***Please send this to at least  five phenomenal women today in 
celebration of Women's History Month. 
If  you do, something good will happen.... YOU will boost another 
woman's  self-esteem!

 Or at least 20%% of her is. How do *we* know? She just took
 TheSpark's famous BITCH*TEST.

 So what about *you*? Is it true that you blame everyone but yourself for
 your problems?

 Your bitchiness seems dangerously high, but there's only one way
 to know for sure:

glad to hear you enjoyed the trip to tennessee. it sounds extremely
relaxing. you don't sound too certain about the job in seattle. are
you not thrilled about it? if not but you really want to be in seattle,
maybe you could take it on the hope that you may find something
better in a couple of months. have you been thinking about the
possibility of tennessee? have you been looking for jobs outside of
the energy industry?

$350 is great. i told my mom to be expecting you to drop by. if
shes not there you can tape it to the back door. also, my mom
said you dropped off the vacuum cleaner... thanks so much.

gotta run, but i will be in touch. keep me posted on all your

The first guy says ""I'm a Y.U.P.P.I.E, you know.... 
Young, Urban, Professional, Peaceful; Intelligent; Ecologist"" 
The second guy says ""I'm a D.I.N.K, you know.... 
Double Income, No Kids."" 
The third guy says, ""I'm a R.U.B., you know... 
Rich, Urban, Biker."" 
They turn to the woman and ask her, ""What are you?"" 
She replies: ""I'm a WIFE, you know.... 
Wash, Iron, F***, Etc."" 
A second gal answers their question before they even ask it: 
""BITCH ""So, just exactly what is a BITCH??????????"" They ask in unison.

had this horrible weighty sense of deja vu- couldn't figure it out til last 
week marci mentioned something that triggered?the memory: i was, of course 
bitching about how sick i am of her badgering and lecturing me to 'party' w/ 
her at her shady discos, and marci laughingly says it's prob b/c she's 
secretly a lesbian, and is trying to hit on me.....aughhhhh1? she's kim

she's just nuts, at the very least....) and i k! now claudia's straight- but 
it's those boarding school kids- clingy and desperate for attention, but 
soooooo much more sophisticated and wordly than just a silly little 
conservative texas girl who has had the same friends for 15 years- basically

many 'experiences' she's had.? ohhh, she's seen fire and she's seen rain, 
alright.....just want to say to her that just b/c daddy sent her away with a 
whole bunch of other spoiled brats that never learned to socialize and behave 
properly b/c they didn't HAVE to- daddy  and 'the family' would always get 
her out of any sticky situation......maybe she's not quite as worldly and 
fabulous as she thinks.? i can not TELL you how many 'lectur! es' she's given 
me about how i'm not social enough, and if i would just let her take me under 
her wing, she could really help me grow up ( can you HEAR the 
condescention?)? i sit there and just nod dumbly, then? am fuming and it's 
all i can do to walk away w/ out slapping the haughty, self-satisfied 
expression off her face.? would like then to tell her that i've probably been 
doing more than she has been socially, but she wouldn't know b/c i'm not 
doing them w/ her...and wouldn't want to invite her along.? it would kill 
her!? she really thinks i go to the library at night, or turn my ringer off 
and read at 9:30.? bless her heart- it she weren't so pushy (my GOD- do you 
remember how bad kim was our sophmore and jr year?? constantly calling and 
putting me on guilt trips, harassing me to spend the night, and i'd have to 
finally give up, and throw her a bone and do it just to placate her?)? i'd 
just tell her i'm hanging out w/ other people! , but don't want her to go 
nuts!? well, enough venting for now....did tell her i'd be in california til

Hey JB - You don't how any of these feel do you?
Later - Jenny

Hangover Classification

1 Star Hangover:
 No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere
 disco nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy. Be  glad
 that you are able to function relatively well. However, you are still
parched. You can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way. Even
vegetarians are craving a steakbomb and a side of gravy fries from any
truck stop USA.

2 Star Hangover:
No pain. Something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have
the attention span and mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you =
chug
to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut, which =
is craving rootie tootie fresh and fruity pancake breakfast from IHOP. =
Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels and even though you have a =
nice demeanor about the office, you are costing your employer valuable =
money because all you really can handle is surfing internet porn and =
writing junk e-mails.

3 Star Hangover:
Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely a space shot
and so not productive. Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her =
perfume
reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends =
after the bouncer 86'd you at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now =
if you were in your bed with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub watching =
the E! fashion awards. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 3 =
Snapples and a liter of diet coke- yet you haven't peed once.

4 Star Hangover:
Life sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or
else you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being
late and has given you a lecture for wreaking of booze. You wore nice
clothes but that can't hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial
spot shaving, (girls, it looks like you put your make-up on while
riding the bumper cars) your teeth have sweaters, your eyes look like
one big vein and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the
class picture of Revere High, '76. You would shoot your mother for one =
or all
of the following: 1. The clock to strike 6pm. 2. The entire appetizer =
list from      TGIFridays or 3. A time machine so you could go back and =
NOT have gone out the night before.

5 Star Hangover:
aka Dante's 4th Circle of Hell. You have a second heartbeat in your
head which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the next
cube. Vodka vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy.
You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from
brushing your teeth. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva
so your tongue is suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the =
last
of the moisture left in your body. Death seems pretty good right now. =
Your
boss doesn't even get mad at you and your co-workers think that your dog
just died because you look so pathetic. You should have called in sick
because let's face it, all you can manage to do is bitch about your =
state-
which is a mystery to you because you definitely don't remember who you =
were
with,  where you were, what you drank and why there is a stranger still
sleeping in your bed, unaccompanied, at your house. The only thing you =
can do is
smoke a bong hit and pass out. It's when you wake up a few hours later
with a lesser star hangover that you eat a large pizza, an order of Kung =
Pao
Chicken, a ham and cheese omelet and a batch of rice krispie treats.

Ten Cents A Dance
Ruth Etting
Words by Lorenz Hart and Music by Richard Rodgers (1930)

-charted at #5 (1930)


Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
Gosh, how they weigh me down
Ten cents a dance, pansies and rough guys
Tough guys who tear my gown

Seven to midnight I hear drums
Loudly the saxophone blows
Trumpets are tearing my eardrums
Customers crush my toes

Sometimes I think I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance

FIVE BEAUTIFUL  WOMEN, and you are one of them!!! 
Facts on Figures;

The average woman weighs 144 lb. and wears between a  12-14. 
One out of every four college aged women has an eating!  disorder.

looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of  women to feel depressed, 
guilty, and shameful.   
Models  twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.

Today they weigh 23%  less.

~Beauty of a Woman~  
The beauty  of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, 
The  figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. 
The  beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes, 
Because that  is the doorway to her heart, 
The place where love resides.  
The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole,  
But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.  
It is the caring that she lovingly gives,  
The passion that she shows. 
The beauty  of a woman 
With passing years -- only  grows.

An English professor  wrote the words, ""Woman without her man is nothing,"" on the blackboard and  directed the students to punctuate it correctly. 
The men wrote: ""Woman,  without her man, is nothing."" 
The women wrote: ""Woman! Without her, man is  nothing."" 
The Images of Mother 
4 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mommy can  do anything! 
8 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mom knows a lot! A whole  lot!
[IMAGE]
12 YEARS OF AGE ~ My  Mother doesn't really know quite everything. 
14 YEARS  OF AGE ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either. 
16  YEARS OF AGE ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned. 
18  YEARS OF AGE ~ That old woman? She's way out of date! 
25  YEARS OF AGE ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.  
35 YEARS OF AGE ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.  
45 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about  it? 
65 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.

could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no 
limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what 
capacity it can sell as firm.  Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be 
less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.  If you think this 
passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it.  

My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as ""firm"" or ""interruptible"" 
since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except 
to assure us over the phone that it is firm!  I'd like to check to see if PNM 
is comfortable with all this before we file anything.  

Call when you can; this is not due 'til Oct. 15.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good

merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.

beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel

evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk

The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to

10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out

am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that

11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed

him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated

comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a 
draft to send around to the usual suspects.  

1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs 
of the acquired capacity.  

 -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue 
associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to 
other shippers.  
 - Net costs will be separately recorded.

2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access 
to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to 
limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to 
other pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain 
the ""no tying"" part).

3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  

 - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction
 - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or 
advantage to any affiliated entity.

4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's 
customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?  

 - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods 
in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM 
shippers should be minimal.  
 - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly 
preferential treatment of TW.

5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing 
open access operations?  

 - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to 
transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco 
Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with 
TW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's 
tariff.  
 - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS 
(right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on 
TW's system.  
 - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be 
able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service 
agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with 
PNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of 
likely scenarios.

6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new 
facilities?  

 - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan 
Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of 
prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the 
PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives 
available to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to 
transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to 
delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding 
the San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by 
effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's 
system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable 
both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently.

I just want you to know that I love you VERY much.  You still mean as much to me now as ever. I am your family whether I am married to Dave or not.  You are an example of kindness and giving, and one of the most special women on the planet as far as I am concerned.

I have been kind of keeping quiet because I know how much Dave needs you right now, and I don't want to say anything that would diminish him in your eyes. Part of the reason that I waited as long as I did to do this is that I desperately wanted one last family Thanksgiving where nobody has to choose who can come or feel strange or anything. 

Dave has decided to stay with Bob and Sandi, and just come up to deal with the vending machines.  I am glad, things are very tense and weird.  I just want to get everything settled. He seems like he is getting angry, and I don't like that.  He told me he wants me to keep the truck instead of the car because everytime he looks at the truck he feels like it is a betrayal. I got him this truck to help him with his business. Wanna buy a brand new truck?

Anyway,  it will all work out and we will all get thru this .  I have a new cell phone number, please feel free to call me, and I will probably call you tonight just to touch base and let you know I love you.

Hi,

We are categorizing the deals in Build Route depending on type of the deal:

If the deal strip is during Peak hours, Build route includes theses deals in On Peak deals section
If the deal strip is during Off-Peak hours, Build route includes these deals in Off-Peak deals section
If the deal strip is for 24 hours, Build route includes these deals in 24Hour Section deals

 We are observing few deals strips only for few hours and not follows any of the above mentioned sections, they are not part of any Peak/OffPeak/24Hour section, and Build route is not selecting these deals.
I am proposing to add one more section called ""Other Deals"" and to include all these deals in this section. 

Please let me know, if you have any questions/suggestions/comments in this regard.

I wish that I could have pulled it together enough to get up with you and take care of you this morning, I really missed that.  Thank you for waking me up and giving me kisses and love. It was a sweet way to start the day.

Today there is a meeting from UBS, in about 10 minutes. I wonder what will be said. I will let you know everything.

On the way to work I was thinking about us planning for our home. I love the sound of our home. I hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today, I like snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work. Soon we will both just be home.

Hopefully I will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the grotto before going to Stanfords, but if not I will meet you there at 6. If I make it to the grotto by 5, will that be enough time for you to pick them up as well?

I am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medication. I hope he gives me some more meds, but he might tell me just to hang in there until the new lower level is stabilized.

Last night was wonderful, each time we are together I find something new to enjoy. I love being with you, holding you and feeling all of your touches and caresses. You make me so happy, and I want to make you happy. I love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes.

confirm.  I know it is a little more hassle, but it works better for us

I never heard back from you regarding my email of 4/18/01.  I had asked if

We would appreciate revisions to the April 12, 2001 certificates.  This

I am suggesting a minor change to the ""Power Risk Management Committee""
certificate (to eliminate the reference to the Exhibit ""A"").  If we leave
the reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm
as Exhibit ""A"" and resend the completed papers to us.  Please let me know
if you are alright with this change.  If so, we ask that you please resend
the certificate dated April 12, 2001.  If you do not wish to make the
change, please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation
labeled Exhibit ""A"" is attached.

Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

That will be fine.  However, you need to attach the trade confirmation (
marked Exhibit ""A"") to each of your certificates since that is how each
certificate is drafted.

Thus, for the April 12, 2001 transaction, please resend your certificates
with the appropriate attachments as referenced in the certificates.
Please call if you have any questions.

Dick:

That will be fine.  However, you need to attach the trade confirmation 
(marked Exhibit ""A"") to each of your certificates since that is how each 
certificate is drafted.

Thus, for the April 12, 2001 transaction, please resend your certificates 
with the appropriate attachments as referenced in the certificates.   Please 
call if you have any questions.

Thanks for ;your assistance.

I am suggesting a minor change to the ""Power Risk Management Committee""
certificate (to eliminate the reference to the Exhibit ""A"").  If we leave
the reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm
as Exhibit ""A"" and resend the completed papers to us.  Please let me know
if you are alright with this change.  If so, we ask that you please resend
the certificate dated April 12, 2001.  If you do not wish to make the
change, please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation
labeled Exhibit ""A"" is attached.

Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

An old hillbilly farmer had a wife who nagged him unmercifully.  From
morning 'til night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about
something.  The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing
with his old mule.  He plowed a lot.

One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field.
He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat
his lunch.  Immediately, however, his wife began haranguing him again.
Complain, nag, nag; it just went on and on.  All of a sudden, the
old mule lashed out with both hind legs and caught her smack in the back of
the head, killing her dead on the spot.

At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather
odd.  When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen
for a minute then nod his head in agreement; but when a man approached him,
he would listen for a minute then shake his head in disagreement.  This was
so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it.

So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him
why he nodded his head and agreed with the women but always shook his head
and disagreed with the men.

The old farmer said, ""Well, the women would come up and say something about
what a wonderful person my wife was, so I'd nod my head in agreement.""

""And what about the men?"" the minister asked.

""They all wanted to know if my mule was for sale.""

Hi, I Donnis, Jennifer's mom.  I know we have not formally met but I fill like I know you.

Jeff, I am in serious trouble.  During my dad's last few months, I had to pay his expenses plus most of his funeral. As a result, I am now in forclosure on my home.  The worst part of that is my husband does not know.  He can't find out because he would kill me and I am not just using that as a figure of speech. I am very scared.  Jennifer must not know because she is on top of the world right now and she doesn't need to have my worrries.

Jeff could you please loan me $6500 just for a few months.  I can reinstate the loan but I have to do it within the next 24 hours.

I know this is very strange for you but I am so desperate that I can not eat or sleep.

I am not usually like this but I have noone that can help me.

I can be reached at 281-703-5935.

Thanks,

Tonight at 7pm, Jim McGreevey will show, once again, why is he the right 
change for New Jersey.

Be sure to tune into WABC-New York (Channel 7) or WPVI-Philadelphia (Channel 
6) to catch Jim going head to head with Bret Schundler in the fourth of five 
live gubernatorial debates.

In the previous three debates, Jim has confidently laid out his plans to 
fight for New Jersey's middle and working class, while Bret's words only 
served to re-enforce his out-of-touch, extremist views.

Time and time again, when confronted with the fact that his platform is 
simply not resonating with the voters of New Jersey, Bret Schundler has 
resorted to petty name-calling.  And, by all means, this is not a new 
phenomenon.

In fact, during the Republican primary, Schundler succeeded in alienating a 
large bloc of moderate Republicans by referring to Acting Governor 
DiFrancesco as a ""moron"" and Congressman Franks as a ""liar.""

As more and more voters agree with Jim McGreevey's positions on education, 
auto insurance, property taxes and the environment, the Schundler Campaign 
has gotten more and more desperate.

These next four years are going to be for the hard working people and 
families of New Jersey who deserve a government - and a governor - who works 
for them.

So, tune in tonight at 7pm to watch our next Governor, Jim McGreevey, show 
everyone why he is the right change for New Jersey.

*****
Paid for by McGreevey for Governor, Inc
Fights for New Jersey.  Right for New Jersey.

     Welcome back to Turkey.
      I hope the weath weather is better in Turkey than here as it has been
cold for spring.  Temps in the 50's during the day and while we have had some
sunny days there has been plenty of rain.  I have been busy with my Golden
""K"" Club (Senior Citizen Kiwanis).  We help with a picnic for mentally
retarded children, read to needy preschool children, help at mentally
retarded track meet, go to weekly meetings and etc.  I am told May is the
busiest month and it has been but it is almost finished.
     Mother and I have been watching the weather in Italy and imagining what
the two of you are doing.  Sue is back and catching up on their business.
This week besides Foundry work they have Visited an honorary dinner for one
of Jeff's college professors.   They are also doing some major work  on their
house.   The Sweeps are over at WGN-TV for a while so now Tom is looking
forward to his trip to Alaska a week from Thursday.  Jeff is still busy with
the gas problems so we hear little from him.  I hear Peter Widman is getting
married.  Though nothing definite I hear it will be in the fall.
     Nothing else for now.  Let us hear from you.   In the meantime  WE SEND
BOTH OF YOU  LOTS of LOVE and KISSES    MOTHER and DAD",Abusive
3093,skilling-j/deleted_items/529.,<20322275.1075852660585.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Jeff, I wouldn't be too concerned about calling you-know-who an asshole.  I don't think it hurt ""W"" too much, and it gave us all something to talk and/or chuckle about.  I am very fond of using it myself, but my favorites are ""dickhead"" and ""dickbrain.""  In fact, I used them so frequently that my husband urged me to use a Spanish translation, which turned out to be Ricardo Cabeza and Ricardo Sesos (pronounced ""say-sos"").  Please feel free to use those anytime you feel the urge.

Seriously, thanks for the good things that are happening at our company.  The stock is looking better, and us old folks appreciate that.  Hope you are taking time to enjoy life as well.  Are you doing the MS150 this year?  Good luck in all your endeavors.  Fondly, Peggy",Abusive

I thought Mark had called you, but I guess not.  He said that he can't have

pathetic....I heard, ""so, are you guys still planning on coming that

Hey cutie, I just spent forever writing you a nice little reply to your
email on the ski trip, my email availibility, phone b.s, your NYC trip and
Scully, all to have this piece of shit freeze up....so I think perhaps I
will just try to get some time to call you tonight!!!!
love, k

You should now have checks from myself, Duncan and Bill.  Sharon said she
would get back to me today, but I think we should jump on this lodge asap.

Charles just got a phone call for you!  Apparently, his phone number is

told the guy we'd pass on his name and number.  His name is Ted Spackey with

Yo, what's up?  How are things across the street?  Let me guess, you got all 
rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week, 
and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.  Unfortunately, I've been 
extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.  Anyway, I 
haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning

He Mat,

I just realized that I can't call your cell number from my work phone.  I

Or, I will try and call you at home so pick up the phone at my house.

Hey, glad to know you are recovering swiftly from Friday nights festivities.  I think I just might have finally kicked my hangover.  Joe said he woke up early Saturday morning to find me passed out in my clothes face down on the couch with the cat snuggling up against me.  As exhausted as I was, I had to meet keith at the office Sat. and then went to a party Sat night where some asshole at the party backed into my car and didn't even come in and tell me!  Now I have to play detective to find out who did it.  Anyway, I had a great time hanging out Friday night and I'm glad you did too.  Hope to see you around soon.  Give me a call if you're going to be around anytime.

Susan and I are suffering from extreme neck pain this weekend from 
overenthusiastic dancing to ""Nookie"" at the Swan.  Just wanted to say thanks 
for hanging out, I really had a good time.  I didn't think I was going to 
get my second wind after dinner but I was pleasantly suprised.  I had a 
monster hangover on Saturday and did not get out of pj's until 4pm..it was 
pathetic.  But I had a great time and its only fitting that I get sloshed on 
my last day.  Take care and catch you sometime at the FP or Lil W.
Mo.

I thought Mark had called you, but I guess not.  He said that he can't have 
Wendy and Amy change their plans, so he can't go on the ski trip.  It was 
pathetic....I heard, ""so, are you guys still planning on coming that 
weekend?...well good....""  He proceeded to talk for at least two hours on the 
phone, and just mentioned the outcome yesterday.  I pushed him to give me 
details, but all he said was the cost was a major factor and that Wendy had 
time off.  I think he was bullshiting and that he never really asked them 
(I'm such a skeptic).  Anyway, fuck'm.  Any ideas?

Scully, all to have this piece of shit freeze up....so I think perhaps I
will just try to get some time to call you tonight!!!!

either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.  Neither of us wanted to do it, 
and Ted got stuck with it.  Well...I would have done it, but I was out until

Subject: Fwd: bad joke.  <G>

A bald man with a wooden leg gets invited to a  
Halloween party. 
He doesn't know what costume to wear to hide his  bald 
head and his leg 
so he 
writes to a costume company to explain  his problem. 
A few days later he received a parcel with the  
following note: 
Dear Sir, Please find enclosed a pirate's outfit.  
The spotted handkerchief will cover your bald head 
and, with your  
wooden 
leg, you will be just right as a pirate. 
Very truly  yours, Acme Costume Co. 
The man thinks this is terrible because they  have just 
emphasized his 
wooden 
leg and so he writes a letter of  complaint. A week 
goes by and he 
receives 
another parcel and a  note, which says: 
Dear Sir, Please find enclosed a monk's habit. The  
long robe will cover 
your 
wooden leg and, with your bald head, you  will really 
look the part. 
Very truly yours, Acme Costume Co.  
Now the man is really upset since they have gone from 
emphasizing  his 
wooden 
leg to emphasizing his bald head so again he writes 
the  company another 
nasty letter of complaint. 
The next day he gets a  small parcel and a note which 
reads: 
Dear Sir, 
Please find the  enclosed bottle of molasses. Pour the 
molasses over 
your 
bald  head, stick your wooden leg up your hinnie and go as 
a caramel apple.  
Very truly yours, 
Acme Costume Co  >>

There have been a number of e-mails related to my initial request for a transition plan for Dick Ingersoll.  

By this e-mail, I am asking that Charles Yeung take the lead on ensuring a smooth transition and that all meetings are appropriately covered.  Please coordinate as a team to work out the details.  Charles please also consider that Jose Bestard will be returning at some point in the near future.

Thanks,

I am planning to go to the Security Subcommittee meeting in Sept since I will be there for other NERC meetings that week.  I may need Andy or Steve to cover the Flowbased meeting onA Aug 30, I am conflicted with a NERC meeting on RTO Scheduling practices on that day.

Subject:	Dick Ingersoll - Consulting Services Agreement

Jim,

I'm responsible for Asset Development in excelr Transportation Services.  Joe Hartsoe advises that Gov't Affairs has a consulting agreement with Dick Ingersoll for certain regulatory support activities.  I'd like to retain Dick to support commercial activities currently underway and, with your consent, have him bill against the existing agreement with Gov't Affairs.  I would outline the tasks + deliverables for him to complete in call-off letters.  Dick would continue his practice of submitting monthly invoices to Bernadette Hawkins, who could liase with Susan Wadle, my assistant, to validate charges and cost centers.

I understand that Dick's consulting agreement expires in October.  I plan to renew with him going forward.  

Please advise how you wish to proceed.

Regards,

Eric Gadd",Abusive
3164,steffes-j/sent_items/795.,<13233202.1075852520087.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Fine.  

Dick and I have worked out exactly the hours for my group that he will work through mid-Oct.  Why not have Dick submit his charges for your group directly to your assistant?  Bernadette is in DC and having these charges running around the country may cause great confusion.  Finally, since I have not looked at his contract lately, I assume that in using this contract to move forward immediately we are not creating any other obligations with Dick?

Thanks,

Jim

	I apologize for being such a pain in the ass, but  I will not be in the office today due to sickness. I think I have some form of streep(?) throat( rash around my neck and very painful to swallow). Reschedule the 11:00 Genesis meeting for any open time after 1:00 tomorrow, the rest of the meeting I will try to call in on.

I called Glenna and she informed me that they are no longer in Folsom but are in Alhambra.  Apparently an email was sent to you and Chris in regards to this, but I am not on this distribution list.  

The new IP address is 166.49.55.18.  

Chris will need to resend yesterday's Load meter files and I will need to pull the meter files. 

Please Chris or myself a call when you get back in the office so we can get this squared away.

Chris & Kourtney,

I think the ISO Meter system is not working.  I even tried running the Meter Scout manually and the confirmation still times out.

Contact Glenna and find out what is going on. 

 I'm leaving for a funeral this morning so I'll be out of the office and pager range.  You can reach me by cell, 409-656-6219.

a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked 
away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the

Subject: Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell, too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!

Thanks for the quick response!  Damn!  Anyway, I'm bummed that you don't
have your ticket down here for that weekend, but there are PLENTY of other
weekends to come visit.  I'll be here for a while.  We'll plan something
soon.  I think that weekend I may ask for a couple days off and drive up to
Bend.  I wonder if it's cheaper to drive than to fly?  I'll let you know
what I'm doing and maybe you can come down and visit...or I'll be up in
Portland soon anyway.

Sooooo - Your house sounds SO awesome!  That's such a cool neighborhood,
too!  I can't believe you're moving on Friday.  I know what you mean about
things like that sucking all of your money away.  kate, I'm sooo sick of my
job these days.  I'm seriously going to spend my weekend looking for fun
things to do with my life.  I really want to be a massage therapist!  How
fun would that be.  I just want to do something that I like doing and not
something that i have to do because i need money.  I guess I need money
anyway, but it's brutal!

We are too young for this I swear.  If you're ever ready to move somewhere
exotic, let me know.  I'm down to go whenever!  It's funny that you said you
look like a real-life ash tray...I seriously got out of my car this morning
on my way to work and caught a glimpse of myself in the window reflection
and had to stop and drop my jaw.  I seriously look like a puffy-eyed old
hag!  Its highly disturbing.  I'm calling my hairdresser NOW to make an
appointment for a cut and color.  :)  don't i sound so cheesy?  I love it!

So write me soon!  How's amber doing?  Still with that new guy, malcom?  :)
Hows your boy life?  Any prospects?

Write more soon!  I'm bored.

Love ya!
Joan

Bizarre facts of this world

In Lebanon, men are legally allowed to have sex with
animals, but the animals must be female. Having sexual
relations with a male animal are punishable by death.
(Like THAT makes sense.)

In Bahrain, a male doctor may legally examine a
woman's genitals, but is prohibited from looking
directly at them during the examination. He may only
see their reflection in a mirror.

Muslims are banned from looking at the genitals of a
corpse. This also applies to undertakers; the sex
organs of the deceased must be covered with a brick or
piece of wood at all times. (A brick??)

The penalty for masturbation in Indonesia is
decapitation.

There are men in Guam whose full-time job is to travel
the countryside and deflower young virgins, who pay
them for the privilege of having sex for the first
time... Reason: under Guam law, it is expressly
forbidden for virgins to marry. (Let's just think for
a minute; is there any job anywhere else in the world
that even comes close to this?)

In Hong Kong, a betrayed wife is legally allowed to
kill her adulterous husband, but may only do so with
her bare hands. The husband's lover, on the other
hand, may be killed in any manner desired. (Ah!
Justice!)

Topless saleswomen are legal in Liverpool, England -
but only in tropical fish stores.(But of course!)

In Cali, Colombia, a woman may only have sex with her
husband, and the first time this happens, her mother
must be in the room to witness the act. (Makes one
shudder at the thought.)

In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, it is illegal for a man to
have sex with a woman and her daughter at the same
time. (I presume this was a big enough problem that
they had to pass this law?)

In Maryland, it is illegal to sell condoms from
vending machines with one exception: prophylactics may
be dispensed from a vending machine only ""in places
where alcoholic beverages are sold for consumption on
the premises."" (Is this a great country or what? Not
as great as Guam!)

If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days, you
would have produced enough sound energy to heat one
cup of coffee. (Hardly seems worth it)

If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months,
enough gas is produced to create the energy of an
atomic bomb. (Now that's more like it)

A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (In my next life
I want to be a pig)

Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an
hour. (Still not over that pig thing)

Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex
for pleasure. (Is that why Flipper was always
smiling?)

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.
(Hummm....I won't touch THAT one!)

The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30
times its own weight and always falls over on its
right side when intoxicated. (From drinking little
bottles of...?) (Did the govt. pay for this
research??)

Some lions mate over 50 times a day. (In my next life
I STILL want to be a pig ... quality over quantity)

Butterflies taste with their feet. (Ah, geez)

An ostrich's eye is bigger than it's brain. (I know
some people like that.)

Starfish don't have brains. (I know some people like
that too)

After reading all these, all I can say is.......Damn
Those Pigs.

Thanks for the quick response!  Damn!  Anyway, I'm bummed that you don't
have your ticket down here for that weekend, but there are PLENTY of other
weekends to come visit.  I'll be here for a while.  We'll plan something
soon.  I think that weekend I may ask for a couple days off and drive up to
Bend.  I wonder if it's cheaper to drive than to fly?  I'll let you know
what I'm doing and maybe you can come down and visit...or I'll be up in
Portland soon anyway.

Sooooo - Your house sounds SO awesome!  That's such a cool neighborhood,
too!  I can't believe you're moving on Friday.  I know what you mean about
things like that sucking all of your money away.  kate, I'm sooo sick of my
job these days.  I'm seriously going to spend my weekend looking for fun
things to do with my life.  I really want to be a massage therapist!  How
fun would that be.  I just want to do something that I like doing and not
something that i have to do because i need money.  I guess I need money
anyway, but it's brutal!

We are too young for this I swear.  If you're ever ready to move somewhere
exotic, let me know.  I'm down to go whenever!  It's funny that you said you
look like a real-life ash tray...I seriously got out of my car this morning
on my way to work and caught a glimpse of myself in the window reflection
and had to stop and drop my jaw.  I seriously look like a puffy-eyed old
hag!  Its highly disturbing.  I'm calling my hairdresser NOW to make an
appointment for a cut and color.  :)  don't i sound so cheesy?  I love it!

So write me soon!  How's amber doing?  Still with that new guy, malcom?  :)
Hows your boy life?  Any prospects?

Write more soon!  I'm bored.

Love ya!
Joan

Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet -
so I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there
if there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon
to discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the
techniques for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming
my life and eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power
from you guys and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might
not be the best time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and
Molly and I found a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's
kickass. But it's sucked away all of my money and will probably take over
every free moment for the next month just to get it set up. If you want,
you should stop by for a sleep over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a
party. And what's up with the wrist disease? Are you not taking your
calcium or something? I'm convinced that these wacky desk jobs are aging us
youthful beauties prematurely. At least that's the excuse I like to give
when I come in to work looking like I just bathed in a life-sized ashtray.
Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out why Brooks is doing the
chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the middle of the night.
Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,
Kate

Subject:  Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from
some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing
lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell,
too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over
my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!

Have fun,
Ciao, Anik


Bizarre facts of this world

In Lebanon, men are legally allowed to have sex with
animals, but the animals must be female. Having sexual
relations with a male animal are punishable by death.
(Like THAT makes sense.)

In Bahrain, a male doctor may legally examine a
woman's genitals, but is prohibited from looking
directly at them during the examination. He may only
see their reflection in a mirror.

Muslims are banned from looking at the genitals of a
corpse. This also applies to undertakers; the sex
organs of the deceased must be covered with a brick or
piece of wood at all times. (A brick??)

The penalty for masturbation in Indonesia is
decapitation.

There are men in Guam whose full-time job is to travel
the countryside and deflower young virgins, who pay
them for the privilege of having sex for the first
time... Reason: under Guam law, it is expressly
forbidden for virgins to marry. (Let's just think for
a minute; is there any job anywhere else in the world
that even comes close to this?)

In Hong Kong, a betrayed wife is legally allowed to
kill her adulterous husband, but may only do so with
her bare hands. The husband's lover, on the other
hand, may be killed in any manner desired. (Ah!
Justice!)

Topless saleswomen are legal in Liverpool, England -
but only in tropical fish stores.(But of course!)

In Cali, Colombia, a woman may only have sex with her
husband, and the first time this happens, her mother
must be in the room to witness the act. (Makes one
shudder at the thought.)

In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, it is illegal for a man to
have sex with a woman and her daughter at the same
time. (I presume this was a big enough problem that
they had to pass this law?)

In Maryland, it is illegal to sell condoms from
vending machines with one exception: prophylactics may
be dispensed from a vending machine only ""in places
where alcoholic beverages are sold for consumption on
the premises."" (Is this a great country or what? Not
as great as Guam!)

If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days, you
would have produced enough sound energy to heat one
cup of coffee. (Hardly seems worth it)

If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months,
enough gas is produced to create the energy of an
atomic bomb. (Now that's more like it)

A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (In my next life
I want to be a pig)

Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an
hour. (Still not over that pig thing)

Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex
for pleasure. (Is that why Flipper was always
smiling?)

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.
(Hummm....I won't touch THAT one!)

The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30
times its own weight and always falls over on its
right side when intoxicated. (From drinking little
bottles of...?) (Did the govt. pay for this
research??)

Some lions mate over 50 times a day. (In my next life
I STILL want to be a pig ... quality over quantity)

Butterflies taste with their feet. (Ah, geez)

An ostrich's eye is bigger than it's brain. (I know
some people like that.)

Starfish don't have brains. (I know some people like
that too)

After reading all these, all I can say is.......Damn
Those Pigs.

THINGS YOU'D LOVE TO SAY AT WORK, BUT CAN'T

1. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit.
2. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce.
3. How about never? Is never good for you?
4. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public.
5. I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to see it my way.
6. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.
7. I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message..
8. I don't work here. I'm a consultant.
9. It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying.
10. Ahhh...I see the screw-up fairy has visited us again...
11. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid.
12. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.
13. I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't give a damn.
14. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.
15. I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you.
16. Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of 
view.
17. The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist.
18. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
19. What am I? Flypaper for freaks!?
20. I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant.
21. It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off.
22. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.
23. And your crybaby whiny-butt opinion would be...?
24. Do I look like a people person?
25. This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.
26. I started out with nothing & still have most of it left.
27. Sarcasm is just one more service we offer.
28. If I throw a stick, will you leave?
29. Errors have been made. Others will be blamed.
30. Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed.
31. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.
32. A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door.
33. Can I trade this job for what's behind door #1?
34. Too many freaks, not enough circuses.
35. Nice perfume. Must you marinate in it?
36. Chaos, panic, & disorder - my work here is done.
37. How do I set a laser printer to stun?
38. I thought I wanted a career, turns out I just wanted pay checks.

Bizarre facts of this world

In Lebanon, men are legally allowed to have sex with
animals, but the animals must be female. Having sexual
relations with a male animal are punishable by death.
(Like THAT makes sense.)

In Bahrain, a male doctor may legally examine a
woman's genitals, but is prohibited from looking
directly at them during the examination. He may only
see their reflection in a mirror.

Muslims are banned from looking at the genitals of a
corpse. This also applies to undertakers; the sex
organs of the deceased must be covered with a brick or
piece of wood at all times. (A brick??)

The penalty for masturbation in Indonesia is
decapitation.

There are men in Guam whose full-time job is to travel
the countryside and deflower young virgins, who pay
them for the privilege of having sex for the first
time... Reason: under Guam law, it is expressly
forbidden for virgins to marry. (Let's just think for
a minute; is there any job anywhere else in the world
that even comes close to this?)

In Hong Kong, a betrayed wife is legally allowed to
kill her adulterous husband, but may only do so with
her bare hands. The husband's lover, on the other
hand, may be killed in any manner desired. (Ah!
Justice!)

Topless saleswomen are legal in Liverpool, England -
but only in tropical fish stores.(But of course!)

In Cali, Colombia, a woman may only have sex with her
husband, and the first time this happens, her mother
must be in the room to witness the act. (Makes one
shudder at the thought.)

In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, it is illegal for a man to
have sex with a woman and her daughter at the same
time. (I presume this was a big enough problem that
they had to pass this law?)

In Maryland, it is illegal to sell condoms from
vending machines with one exception: prophylactics may
be dispensed from a vending machine only ""in places
where alcoholic beverages are sold for consumption on
the premises."" (Is this a great country or what? Not
as great as Guam!)

If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days, you
would have produced enough sound energy to heat one
cup of coffee. (Hardly seems worth it)

If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months,
enough gas is produced to create the energy of an
atomic bomb. (Now that's more like it)

A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (In my next life
I want to be a pig)

Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an
hour. (Still not over that pig thing)

Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex
for pleasure. (Is that why Flipper was always
smiling?)

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.
(Hummm....I won't touch THAT one!)

The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30
times its own weight and always falls over on its
right side when intoxicated. (From drinking little
bottles of...?) (Did the govt. pay for this
research??)

Some lions mate over 50 times a day. (In my next life
I STILL want to be a pig ... quality over quantity)

Butterflies taste with their feet. (Ah, geez)

An ostrich's eye is bigger than it's brain. (I know
some people like that.)

Starfish don't have brains. (I know some people like
that too)

After reading all these, all I can say is.......Damn
Those Pigs.

Thanks for the quick response!  Damn!  Anyway, I'm bummed that you don't
have your ticket down here for that weekend, but there are PLENTY of other
weekends to come visit.  I'll be here for a while.  We'll plan something
soon.  I think that weekend I may ask for a couple days off and drive up to
Bend.  I wonder if it's cheaper to drive than to fly?  I'll let you know
what I'm doing and maybe you can come down and visit...or I'll be up in
Portland soon anyway.

Sooooo - Your house sounds SO awesome!  That's such a cool neighborhood,
too!  I can't believe you're moving on Friday.  I know what you mean about
things like that sucking all of your money away.  kate, I'm sooo sick of my
job these days.  I'm seriously going to spend my weekend looking for fun
things to do with my life.  I really want to be a massage therapist!  How
fun would that be.  I just want to do something that I like doing and not
something that i have to do because i need money.  I guess I need money
anyway, but it's brutal!

We are too young for this I swear.  If you're ever ready to move somewhere
exotic, let me know.  I'm down to go whenever!  It's funny that you said you
look like a real-life ash tray...I seriously got out of my car this morning
on my way to work and caught a glimpse of myself in the window reflection
and had to stop and drop my jaw.  I seriously look like a puffy-eyed old
hag!  Its highly disturbing.  I'm calling my hairdresser NOW to make an
appointment for a cut and color.  :)  don't i sound so cheesy?  I love it!

So write me soon!  How's amber doing?  Still with that new guy, malcom?  :)
Hows your boy life?  Any prospects?

Write more soon!  I'm bored.

Love ya!

Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet -
so I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there
if there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon
to discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the
techniques for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming
my life and eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power
from you guys and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might
not be the best time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and
Molly and I found a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's
kickass. But it's sucked away all of my money and will probably take over
every free moment for the next month just to get it set up. If you want,
you should stop by for a sleep over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a
party. And what's up with the wrist disease? Are you not taking your
calcium or something? I'm convinced that these wacky desk jobs are aging us
youthful beauties prematurely. At least that's the excuse I like to give
when I come in to work looking like I just bathed in a life-sized ashtray.
Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out why Brooks is doing the
chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the middle of the night.
Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,

Subject:  Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from
some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing
lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell,
too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over
my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!

> THE 27 TOP THINGS YOU WISH YOU COULD SAY AT WORK
> 1.   I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit.
> 2.   I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't give a fuck.
> 3.   How about ""never""? Is ""never"" good enough for you?
> 4.   It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying.
> 5.   I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in
>      public.
> 6.   Ahhh, I see the fuck-up fairy has visited us again.
> 7.   You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.
> 8.   Stop, I'm already visualising the duct tape over your
       mouth.
> 9.   The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist.
> 10.  Someday, we'll look back on this, laugh nervously and change the
>      subject.
> 11.  I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you.
> 12.  I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to
>      pronounce.
> 13.  Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
> 14.  I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid.
> 15.  What am I? Flypaper for freaks!?
> 16.  I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant.
> 17.  Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of
>      view.
> 18.  It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off.
> 19.  Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.
> 20.  No, my powers can only be used for good.
> 21.  I'm really easy to get along with once people learn to worship me.
> 22.  You sound reasonable......time to up my medication.
> 23.  I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.
> 24.  I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message.
> 25.  I don't work here. I'm a consultant.
> 26.  Who me? I just wander from room to room.
> 27.  My toys! My toys! I can't do this job without my toys.
       So just leave them alone before you make them want to
       leave as well.

> Useful Expressions for those HIGH STRESS days
> 1.   Well, aren't we just a ray of fucking sunshine?
> 2.   Not the brightest crayon in the box now, are we?
> 3.   Do I look like a fucking people person?
> 4.   This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.
> 5.   I pretend to work. They pretend to pay me.
> 6.   You!!! Off my planet!!
> 7.   Practice random acts of intelligence & senseless acts of
>      self-control.
> 8.   I like cats too. Let's exchange recipes.
> 9.   Did the aliens forget to remove your anal probe?
> 10.  And your crybaby whiny-assed opinion would be...?
> 11.  How many times do I have to flush before you go away?

3221,taylor-m/all_documents/119.,<23220827.1075859877686.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"One day, while walking down the street, a highly successful lawyer was 
tragically hit by a bus and killed. His soul arrived up in Heaven, where he 
was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself.

""Welcome to Heaven,"" said St. Peter. ""Before you get settled in, though, it 
seems we have a problem. You see,  we've never once had a lawyer  make it 
this far and we're not really sure what to do with you.""

""No problem-just let me in,"" said the lawyer
 
""Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let 
you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven, and then you can choose whichever 
one you want to spend an eternity in.""  

""Actually, I think I've made up my mind...I prefer  to stay in Heaven,"" said 
the lawyer 

 ""Sorry, we have rules,"" said St. Peter, and with that, he put the lawyer in 
an elevator  and it went  down-down-down to Hell.

The doors opened and the lawyer found himself stepping out onto the putting 
green on a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and 
standing in front of him were all of his friends and fellow lawyers with whom 
he had worked. They were all dressed in black tie and evening gowns and 
cheering for him. They ran up and kissed him on both cheeks and they talked 
about  old times. They played an excellent round of golf, and that night went 
to the country club where he enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner.

The lawyer even got to meet the Devil, who was actually a woman and very good 
looking.  He had a great time telling jokes and dancing.  In fact, the lawyer 
was having such a good time, that before he knew it, it was time to leave.

 Everybody shook his hand, thanked him for coming  and waved goodbye as he 
got on the elevator.

 The elevator went up-up-up and opened back at the Pearly Gates, where he 
found St. Peter waiting for him. ""Now it's time to spend a day in Heaven,"" he 
said.

 So the lawyer spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing 
the harp and singing. He had a great time, and before he knew it, his  24 
hours were up. St. Peter came and got him.

 ""So, you've spent a day in Hell and you've spent a day in Heaven. Now you  
must choose your eternity,"" he said.  The lawyer  paused for a second, and 
then replied, ""Well, I never thought I'd say this. I mean, Heaven has been 
really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell.""  So St. Peter 
escorted him to the elevator and again he went down-down-down, back to Hell.  

 When the doors of the elevator opened, the lawyer found himself standing in 
a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. He saw his friends and 
fellow lawyers were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and 
putting it in sacks.

The Devil appeared before the lawyer.  She now had horns sticking out of her 
head, fire spit out her ears and nose  and she had a very evil laugh

The lawyer stammered:   ""I don't understand.  Yesterday, I was here and  
there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and danced and 
had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all of my 
friends and fellow lawyers look overworked and miserable."" 

The Devil looked at the lawyer and smiled.

 ""Yesterday we were recruiting you; today you're ours.""

Eating fish does contribute to your intelligence, particularly before and 
just after you're born. 

A researcher at the University of Connecticut has found that some fish are 
high in a certain chemical that's vital to brain and nerve cell growth in 
fetuses and newborns. 

Babies can't make enough docahexanoic -- or DHA -- a fatty acid that helps 
the brain develop. They must take whatever their mothers give them, either 
through the umbilical cord or by breast-feeding after they're born. And note 
that baby formula isn't fortified with DHA. 

Women who eat cold-water species, like salmon, trout, sardines and tuna, give 
their babies a better chance at maximizing brain tissue development, the 
research found. Other fish high in the chemical are herring, swordfish and 
mackerel. ",Abusive

tragically hit by a bus and killed. His soul arrived up in Heaven, where he 
was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself.

""Welcome to Heaven,"" said St. Peter. ""Before you get settled in, though, it 
seems we have a problem. You see,  we've never once had a lawyer  make it 
this far and we're not really sure what to do with you.""

""No problem-just let me in,"" said the lawyer
 
""Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let 
you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven, and then you can choose whichever 
one you want to spend an eternity in.""  

""Actually, I think I've made up my mind...I prefer  to stay in Heaven,"" said 
the lawyer 

 ""Sorry, we have rules,"" said St. Peter, and with that, he put the lawyer in 
an elevator  and it went  down-down-down to Hell.

The doors opened and the lawyer found himself stepping out onto the putting 
green on a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and 
standing in front of him were all of his friends and fellow lawyers with whom 
he had worked. They were all dressed in black tie and evening gowns and 
cheering for him. They ran up and kissed him on both cheeks and they talked 
about  old times. They played an excellent round of golf, and that night went 
to the country club where he enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner.

The lawyer even got to meet the Devil, who was actually a woman and very good 
looking.  He had a great time telling jokes and dancing.  In fact, the lawyer 
was having such a good time, that before he knew it, it was time to leave.

 Everybody shook his hand, thanked him for coming  and waved goodbye as he 
got on the elevator.

 The elevator went up-up-up and opened back at the Pearly Gates, where he 
found St. Peter waiting for him. ""Now it's time to spend a day in Heaven,"" he 
said.

 So the lawyer spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing 
the harp and singing. He had a great time, and before he knew it, his  24 
hours were up. St. Peter came and got him.

 ""So, you've spent a day in Hell and you've spent a day in Heaven. Now you  
must choose your eternity,"" he said.  The lawyer  paused for a second, and 
then replied, ""Well, I never thought I'd say this. I mean, Heaven has been 
really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell.""  So St. Peter 
escorted him to the elevator and again he went down-down-down, back to Hell.  

 When the doors of the elevator opened, the lawyer found himself standing in 
a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. He saw his friends and 
fellow lawyers were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and 
putting it in sacks.

The Devil appeared before the lawyer.  She now had horns sticking out of her 
head, fire spit out her ears and nose  and she had a very evil laugh

The lawyer stammered:   ""I don't understand.  Yesterday, I was here and  
there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and danced and 
had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all of my 
friends and fellow lawyers look overworked and miserable."" 

The Devil looked at the lawyer and smiled.

 ""Yesterday we were recruiting you; today you're ours.""

Eating fish does contribute to your intelligence, particularly before and 
just after you're born. 

A researcher at the University of Connecticut has found that some fish are 
high in a certain chemical that's vital to brain and nerve cell growth in 
fetuses and newborns. 

Babies can't make enough docahexanoic -- or DHA -- a fatty acid that helps 
the brain develop. They must take whatever their mothers give them, either 
through the umbilical cord or by breast-feeding after they're born. And note 
that baby formula isn't fortified with DHA. 

Women who eat cold-water species, like salmon, trout, sardines and tuna, give 
their babies a better chance at maximizing brain tissue development, the 
research found. Other fish high in the chemical are herring, swordfish and 
mackerel. ",Abusive

Cows and World Order

 A CHRISTIAN: You have two cows. You keep one and give
 one to your neighbor.

 A REPUBLICAN: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none.
 So what?

 A DEMOCRAT: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none.
 You feel guilty for being successful. You vote people
 into office who tax your cows, forcing you to sell one
 to raise money to pay the tax. The people you voted for
 then take the tax money and buy a cow and give it to
 your neighbor. You feel righteous.

 A SOCIALIST: You have two cows. The government takes one
 and gives it to your neighbor.

 A COMMUNIST: You have two cows. The government seizes
 both and provides you with milk.

 A FASCIST: You have two cows. The government seizes both
 and sells you the milk. You join the underground and
 start a campaign of sabotage.

 DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The
 government taxes you to the point you have to sell both
 to support a man in a foreign country who has only one
 cow, which was a gift from your government.

 CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. You sell
 one, buy a bull, and build a herd of cows.

 BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The
 government takes them both, shoots one, milks the other,
 pays you for the milk, then pours the milk down the
 drain.

 AN AMERICAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You sell
 one, and force the other to produce the milk of four
 cows. You are surprised when the cow drops dead.

 A FRENCH CORPORATION: You have two cows. You go on
 strike because you want three cows.

 A JAPANESE CORPORATION: You have two cows. You redesign
 them so they are one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow
 and produce twenty times the milk.

 A GERMAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You re-engineer
 them so they live for 100 years, eat once a month, and
 milk themselves.

 AN ITALIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows, but you don't
 know where they are. You break for lunch.

 A RUSSIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You count them
 and learn you have five cows. You count them again and
 learn you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn
 you have 12 cows. You stop counting cows and open
 another bottle of vodka.

 A MEXICAN CORPORATION: You think you have two cows, but
 you don't know what a cow looks like. You take a nap.

 A SWISS CORPORATION: You have 5000 cows, none of which
 belongs to you. You charge for storing them for others.

 A BRAZILIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You enter
 into a partnership with an American corporation. Soon
 you have 1000 cows and the American corporation declares
 bankruptcy.

 AN INDIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You worship
 them.

An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk"". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss

I am attaching a profile of the efficiencies between Bloomfield and Bisti for Feb 22-
March 11.

 << File: sj3.doc >> 
Summary
1)	Before pigging, (i.e. 21-27th), the efficiency was about 96.5%
2)	After the pig run on the 27th, the efficiency increased to about 102% for two days.
3)	It averaged about 101% for the next 6 days (i.e. 28th-5th March).  
4)	It then steadily plummeted to 98% over a 3-day period - a percent degradation a day! (5th-8th March)
5)	It remains around the 98% average today.

Essentially, the high efficiency resulting from the 27th Feb pigging lasted just about a week.
The targeted efficiency for this section is 103%.

At the TW commercial meeting this afternoon, we indicated that applying the DRA around the end of May (together with other planned outages) may be the way to go. Meanwhile,  I believe we should schedule another pig run as soon as we can. 
I did also receive the sample collected from the last pig run. I will have it analyzed and report on our findings.

Please let me know any thoughts you may have on this issue

Kori asked us to kill all the deals between her portfolio and other portfolio due to the bankruptcy.  For this reason, I used Casey's ID (because I did not have access) to access about 20 deals, and I killed these deals.  I have created a spreadsheet with each of these deals listed.

Nice spelling. You're on your way to being a career lawn-care
specialist. How bout I send you a fucking book so you can learn to
read and write?  I'm  giving your older brother the space ranger, at
least HE can spell!

Dear Santa,
I have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I ask for is
peace and joy in the world for everybody!

Dear Sarah,
Your mother smoked a lot of pot while she was pregnant with you,
didn't she?
Santa
Dear Santa,
I've written you for three years now asking for a fire truck.
Please, I really really want a fire truck this year!
Love, Joey
Dear Joey,
Let me make it up to you. While you sleep, I'm gonna torch your
house. You'll have more fire trucks than you'll know what to
do with.
Santa
Dear Santa,
I don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas, I'd like for
my mommy and daddy to get back together. Please see what you 
can do.

Dear Teddy,
What, and ruin that hot affair your dad's still having with the

Let meget you some nice Legos instead.

Dear Santa,
I need more Pokemon cards please! All my friends have more
Pokemon cards than me. Please bring me some.
Love, Michelle
Dear Michelle,
It blows my fucking mind. Kids are forcing their parents to buy
hundreds of dollars worth of these stupid cards, and none of
you snot-nosed brats are even learning to play the game.
Let me get you something more your speed, like ""Chutes and Ladders.""
Santa
Dear Santa,
I want a new bike, playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, a
drum kit, a pony and a tuba.
Love, Francis
Dear Francis,
Who the hell names their kid ""Francis"" nowadays?
Santa
Dear Santa,
I left milk and cookies for you under the tree, and I left
carrots for your reindeer outside the backdoor.
Love, Susan
Dear Susan,
Milk gives me the shits and carrots make the deer fart in my
face. You want to be a kiss-ass? Leave me a glass of Chivas 
Regal and some Toblerone.
Santa
Dear Santa,
What do you do the other 364 days of the year? Are you making
toys?
Your friend, Thomas
Dear Thomas,
All the toys get made in China. I have a condo in Vegas, where I
spend most my time squeezing cocktail waitresses asses, and
losing all my cash at the craps table.
Santa
Dear Santa,
Do you see us when we're sleeping, like in the song?
Love, Jessica
Dear Jessica,
No, but I watch your mommy when she's in the shower. When 
you get older and grow titties, I'll be watching you, too.

Dear Santa,
I really really want a puppy this year. Please please please PLEASE,

Timmy,
That whiney begging shit may work with your folks, but that crap
don't work up here. You're getting a sweater again.

Dearest Santa,
We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you get into our home?
Love, Marky
Mark,
First, stop calling yourself ""Marky,"" that's why you're getting
your ass whipped at school. Second, you don't live in a house, that's
a low-rent apartment complex you're living in. Third, I get inside 
your pad just like all the burglars do, through your bedroom window.
Sweet dreams!

OUTSIDE: I always wanted to be rich, powerful and well-respected.
INSIDE:  And while I'm dreaming, I wish you weren't so damn ugly.

OUTSIDE: Sex with you is like using drugs:
INSIDE:  Lots of people do it, but nobody's stupid enough to admit it.

Subject: Four Good Management Lessons!!


Lesson Number One 
***************** 
A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. 
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, 
""Can I also sit like you and do nothing all daylong?"" 
The crow answered: ""Sure, why not."" 

So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested. 
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. 

Management Lesson: 
To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Two 
***************** 
A turkey was chatting with a bull. 
""I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,""sighed the turkey, 
""but I haven't got the energy. 
""Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?"" replied the bull. 
""They're packed with nutrients."" 

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him 
enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. 
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. 
Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the
tree. 
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the
tree. 

Management Lesson: 
Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Three 
******************** 
When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss. 
The brain said, 
""I should be Boss 
    because I control the whole body's responses and functions."" 
 
The feet said, 
""We should be Boss 
    as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go.
 
"" The hands said, 
""We should be the Boss 
    because we do all the work and earn all the money."" 

And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes.... 
 
until finally the asshole spoke up. 
 
All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. 
So the asshole went on strike, 
    blocked itself up and refused to work. 

Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, 
the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered.


Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss, 
so the motion was passed. 
 
All the other parts did all the work while the Boss just sat and passed out
the shit! 

Management Lesson: 
You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Four 
******************* 

A little bird was flying south for the winter. 
It was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. 
While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. 
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung,
it began to realize how warm it was. 
The dung was actually thawing him out! 
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. 

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. 
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung,

and promptly dug him out and ate him! 

Management Lessons: 
1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy. 
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!

retiring today and I'm basically supposed to replace
him on this project, but I've been so busy with other
projects that I haven't had any time to pick his
brain.  So I am fucked but large.

Send the package to the office.  Our secretaries don't
do shit for me ever, so they can at least lug my
gifts around.

This weekend isn't good for a chat, unfortunately.
I leave for Boston tonight and T and I might go
skiing.
This is the last time I'll see her until after Vegas,
since she leaves for India on Tuesday and I leave
for my 6 week sojourn after that.  So I plan to get
very acquainted with my right hand.  Maybe I'll have
time to acquire some skill with my left.

I may very seriously blow my brains out while we're in
Vegas.  I saw Fight Club yet again last night and
shooting himself in the head seemed to work for Ed
Norton.  One thing is for sure, there is definitely
no downside to shooting yourself in the head.  Unless
you paralyze yourself or something.  That's the thing
about life.  As awful as it is, it can always be
worse.  In my case, losing the ability to terminate
myself at any time would be the worst thing ever.

Its raining today, also.

retiring today and I'm basically supposed to replace
him on this project, but I've been so busy with other

Send the package to the office.  Our secretaries don't
do shit for me ever, so they can at least lug my
gifts around.

This weekend isn't good for a chat, unfortunately.
I leave for Boston tonight and T and I might go
skiing.
This is the last time I'll see her until after Vegas,
since she leaves for India on Tuesday and I leave
for my 6 week sojourn after that.  So I plan to get
very acquainted with my right hand.  Maybe I'll have
time to acquire some skill with my left.

I may very seriously blow my brains out while we're in
Vegas.  I saw Fight Club yet again last night and
shooting himself in the head seemed to work for Ed
Norton.  One thing is for sure, there is definitely
no downside to shooting yourself in the head.  Unless
you paralyze yourself or something.  That's the thing
about life.  As awful as it is, it can always be
worse.  In my case, losing the ability to terminate
myself at any time would be the worst thing ever.

I told him I'd start selling the 3's for HE:20 and if there were any problems or any changes to give me a call.

The first three hours were close but weren't deficient.

NEVP called at 21:00 and informed us the cut.  Dynegy was not able to resupply the energy so I bought APS tranny and power from EPE for $70.00 and will show it in the EL PASO model as a sell from EPE to DYNEGY 8MW @ $70 Palo Verde.  The Tranny from APS was $3.50, and I will show an annuity for this amount billed to Dynegy.  I built two annuities for the tranny purchase from APS and its subsequent billing to Dynegy (674830 & 674831).  The EPEC deals that relate to the cut are 674832 and 674833.

Effective October 1st...BPA transmission will be the following prices...

BPA non-firm point to point (or network) will be $2.92 with 1.9% losses

BPA non-firm on the intertie will be $3.34 with 3% losses

Losses could be expected to add up to $5 of the total price--do not put losses into the purchase from BPA Transmission in Enpower--losses for BPA will be settled at the end of the month in a single annuity.

Total price for MPC to CAISO at MALIN on BPA non-firm all the way will be $6.26
Total price for MPC to CAISO at NOB on BPA NON-FIRM all the way will be $6.26--Remember to check tranny sheet for PGE-tranny availability--WE HAVE NO MORE LT FIRM FROM BIG EDDY TO NOB--

SNOPud is charging $3.25 for point to point plus 1.9% losses.

I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit.  So I am s=
itting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks lo=
ose.  It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morni=
ng.  I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that a=
re serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food w=
ill last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast f=
rom a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used t=
o because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for Enro=
n employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the flo=
or is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice b=
reakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would=
 wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs.  So, I grab the first =
omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill. =
 Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they w=
ill get crazy and add salsa or something.  The next thing you know, straigh=
t out of a FOX tv show or ""You've Gotta See This"" episode...this old woman =
is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago.  The propane tanks he=
ating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to te=
n feet in height.  The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, o=
r anything.  Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmo=
re's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree.  A few seconds before this =
high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in t=
he middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and=
 glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV =
that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is dire=
ctly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly faci=
ng the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat=
 of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thou=
ght, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is g=
oing to jump in there and save this poor lady.  The old woman is yelling ,""=
Somebody get me outta here!""...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, so=
meone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze.  Who is this masked man=
, I have no clue.  However, I do witness Les from middle marketing doing hi=
s best Maurice Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the=
 only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing=
 a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the =
fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to=
 blister up.  The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on th=
e old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torc=
hing a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens.  The alarm in o=
ur building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to m=
ake even Polarek leave the area.  So, the fire departemnt comes and the old=
 woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital.  Who know=
s what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bu=
nch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in =
flames someday.  Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted abo=
ut 20 minutes writing this drama.  Take care, Scotty

A man walks out of a bar, stumbling back and forth with a key in his hand. A cop on the beat sees him and approaches. ""Can I help you sir?"" 
""Yesssh!Ssssshomebody ssshtole my car!"" the man replies. The cop asks, ""Where was the car the last time you saw it?"" ""It wassssat the end of thissshkey!"" the man replies.About that time the Officer looks down to see that the man's weineris hanging out of his fly for all theworld to see. He asks the man, ""Sir, are you aware that you are exposing yourself?"" Momentarily confused, the drunk looks down woefully at his crotch, and, without missing a beat, blurtsout ""SON-OF-A-BITCH... THEY GOT MY GIRLFRIEND, TOO!""

 You people ALLLL SUCK!  I can't play because I have a really tough job that would leave any of you as shells of the humans you think you are.  YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT PRESSURE I'M UNDER!  So go on with your little game, while I subsist on cruel PF Chang delivery and some bits of blow snorted off a stripper's ass.

LOL.............how in the world did you find that.


Here's some funny Santa letters

Dear Santa,
I wud like a kool toy space ranjur fer xmas. Iv ben a gud boy all
yeer.
Yer Frend,
BiLLy

Dear Billy,
Nice spelling.  You're on your way to a career in lawn care.  How
about I send you a fucking book so you can learn to read and write?  I'm
giving your older brother the space ranger.  At least HE can spell!
Santa

Dear Santa,
I have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I ask for is
peace and joy in the world for everybody!
Love,
Sarah

Dear Sarah,
You're parents smoked pot when they had you, didn't they?
Santa

Dear Santa,
I don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas, I'd like for my
mommy and daddy to get back together.  Please see what
you can do.
Love,
Teddy

Dear Teddy,
Look, your dad's banging the babysitter like a screen door in a
hurricane. you think he's gonna give that up to come back
to your frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly?  It's time to give up that
dream.  Let me get you some nice Legos instead.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I want a new bike, a Playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, a
drum kit, a pony and a tuba.
Love
Francis

Dear Francis,
Who names their kid ""Francis"" nowadays?  I bet you're gay.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I left milk and cookies for you under the tree, and I left carrots for
your reindeer outside the back door.
Love,
Susan

Dear Susan,
Milk gives me the runs and carrots make the deer fart in my face when
riding in the sleigh.  You want to do me a favor? Leave me a bottle of
scotch.
Santa

Dear Santa,
What do you do the other 364 days of the year?  Are you busy making
toys?
Your friend,
Thomas

Dear Thomas,
All the toys are made in China.  I have a condo in Vegas, where I
spend most of my time making low-budget porno films.  I unwind by drinking
myself silly and squeezing the asses of cocktail waitresses
while losing money at the craps table.  Hey, you wanted to know.
Santa

Dear Santa,
Do you see us when we're sleeping, do you really know when we're
awake, like in the song?
Love,
Jessica

Dear Jessica,
Are you really that gullible?  Good luck in whatever you do.  I'm skipping
your house.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I really really want a puppy this year. Please please please PLEASE
PLEASE could I have one?
Timmy

Dear Timmy,
That whiney begging shit may work with your folks, but that crap
doesn't work with me.  You're getting a sweater again.
Santa

Dearest Santa,
We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you get into our home?
Love
Marky

Mark,
First, stop calling yourself ""Marky"", that's why you're getting your ass
kicked at school.  Second, you don't live in a house, you live in a
low-rent apartment complex.  Third, I get inside your pad just like all the
burglars do, through your bedroom window.
Sweet dreams,
Santa",Abusive

I just thought that I would let you know the final cost calculations
for the trip that the group has done.  After taking into account the place,
transportation, food, alcohol, skiing, rentals, and other essentials, it
looks like it is gonna run around 1245$/person.  Since you are now making
the big bucks and judging how badly you want to spend time with me, I see
this as an excellent bargain for you.  Let me know if you have any issues.

I don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas, I'd like for my
mommy and daddy to get back together.  Please see what
you can do.
Love,
Teddy

Dear Teddy,
Look, your dad's banging the babysitter like a screen door in a
hurricane. you think he's gonna give that up to come back
to your frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly?  It's time to give up that
dream.  Let me get you some nice Legos instead.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I want a new bike, a Playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, a
drum kit, a pony and a tuba.
Love
Francis

Dear Francis,
Who names their kid ""Francis"" nowadays?  I bet you're gay.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I left milk and cookies for you under the tree, and I left carrots for
your reindeer outside the back door.
Love,
Susan

Dear Susan,
Milk gives me the runs and carrots make the deer fart in my face when
riding in the sleigh.  You want to do me a favor? Leave me a bottle of
scotch.
Santa

Dear Santa,
What do you do the other 364 days of the year?  Are you busy making
toys?
Your friend,
Thomas

Dear Thomas,
All the toys are made in China.  I have a condo in Vegas, where I
spend most of my time making low-budget porno films.  I unwind by drinking
myself silly and squeezing the asses of cocktail waitresses
while losing money at the craps table.  Hey, you wanted to know.
Santa

Dear Santa,
Do you see us when we're sleeping, do you really know when we're
awake, like in the song?
Love,
Jessica

Dear Jessica,
Are you really that gullible?  Good luck in whatever you do.  I'm skipping
your house.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I really really want a puppy this year. Please please please PLEASE
PLEASE could I have one?
Timmy

Dear Timmy,
That whiney begging shit may work with your folks, but that crap
doesn't work with me.  You're getting a sweater again.
Santa

Dearest Santa,
We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you get into our home?
Love
Marky

Mark,
First, stop calling yourself ""Marky"", that's why you're getting your ass
kicked at school.  Second, you don't live in a house, you live in a
low-rent apartment complex.  Third, I get inside your pad just like all the
burglars do, through your bedroom window.
Sweet dreams,
Santa",Abusive

I just thought that I would let you know the final cost calculations
for the trip that the group has done.  After taking into account the place,
transportation, food, alcohol, skiing, rentals, and other essentials, it
looks like it is gonna run around 1245$/person.  Since you are now making
the big bucks and judging how badly you want to spend time with me, I see
this as an excellent bargain for you.  Let me know if you have any issues.

The pieces of a two-piece puzzle just don't seem to want to fit together. You've tried countless angles, jerry-riggings and creative solutions, but you keep coming up short. Perhaps the answer, then, is to work with the flaws between the pieces as well as the pieces themselves.

full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time

8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as

10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and

the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.",Abusive

BiLLy

Dear Billy,
Nice spelling.  You're on your way to a career in lawn care.  How
about I send you a fucking book so you can learn to read and write?  I'm
giving your older brother the space ranger.  At least HE can spell!
Santa

Dear Santa,
I have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I ask for is
peace and joy in the world for everybody!
Love,
Sarah

Dear Sarah,
You're parents smoked pot when they had you, didn't they?
Santa

Dear Santa,
I don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas, I'd like for my
mommy and daddy to get back together.  Please see what
you can do.
Love,
Teddy

Dear Teddy,
Look, your dad's banging the babysitter like a screen door in a
hurricane. you think he's gonna give that up to come back
to your frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly?  It's time to give up that
dream.  Let me get you some nice Legos instead.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I want a new bike, a Playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, a
drum kit, a pony and a tuba.

Francis

Dear Francis,
Who names their kid ""Francis"" nowadays?  I bet you're gay.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I left milk and cookies for you under the tree, and I left carrots for
your reindeer outside the back door.
Love,
Susan

Dear Susan,
Milk gives me the runs and carrots make the deer fart in my face when
riding in the sleigh.  You want to do me a favor? Leave me a bottle of
scotch.
Santa

Dear Santa,
What do you do the other 364 days of the year?  Are you busy making
toys?
Your friend,
Thomas

Dear Thomas,
All the toys are made in China.  I have a condo in Vegas, where I
spend most of my time making low-budget porno films.  I unwind by drinking
myself silly and squeezing the asses of cocktail waitresses
while losing money at the craps table.  Hey, you wanted to know.
Santa

Dear Santa,
Do you see us when we're sleeping, do you really know when we're
awake, like in the song?
Love,
Jessica

Dear Jessica,
Are you really that gullible?  Good luck in whatever you do.  I'm skipping
your house.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I really really want a puppy this year. Please please please PLEASE
PLEASE could I have one?
Timmy

Dear Timmy,
That whiney begging shit may work with your folks, but that crap
doesn't work with me.  You're getting a sweater again.
Santa

Dearest Santa,
We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you get into our home?
Love
Marky

Mark,
First, stop calling yourself ""Marky"", that's why you're getting your ass
kicked at school.  Second, you don't live in a house, you live in a
low-rent apartment complex.  Third, I get inside your pad just like all the
burglars do, through your bedroom window.

Let's gauge the interest in a first-person shooter: 
Through Allan, we have several at our disposal, and if we want to own them, there are a ton of great ones available at sub-basement prices.  However, let's try before we buy (if you haven't already).  Current options include Rogue Spear (very realistic and detailed), Quake (fragtastic), and Tribes (all about teamwork).  There are others, too, but these were the ones Allan and I were chatting about.
You folks wanna try this?

Gene,

I have a methodology that gives me the answer with 3 uses of the balance 50% of the time but requires 4 uses of the balance the other 50% of the time.
Are you sure this can be done???? 

For my first use of the scales, I place a total of 6 balls on the scales (3 on each side). If they balance, then none of the six balls on the scales is the odd ball. If they do not balance, then none of the six balls that were left off of the scales is the odd ball. Thus, I have reduced the possible suspects to 6 after one use of the scales.

Is this the right starting point???

Second, I place three balls that have been eliminated as suspects on one side of the scales and three balls that are still possibles on the other. Two outcomes:

1. If the scales do not balance, I know that one of the three suspects on the scales is the odd ball and I know whether it is heavier or lighter than the others. I can determine which is the odd ball on the third use of the scales by placing only one remaining suspect on each side of the scales. If they balance, then the suspect left off is the odd ball. If they do not balance, I know which one is odd because I already know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter.  

2. If the scales balance on my second use of the scales, then I have three remaining suspects (the balls left off the scales) but do not know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter. I cannot figure out how to determine both the heavier/lighter question plus identify the odd ball in just one more use of the scales. I need two more uses. 

Am I close at all????


I hope that you had a good trip back. Stay in touch.

The untold story is how much money the gas and power trading folks have made that some weenies in three piece in suits in Corp pissed away. Looks like we are going to be bought by Dynegy. Hang in there with ONE. I am agitating for a Christmas visit to Mich by us, so hope to see you then.

Keep on it,

I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

Subject: Westgate


Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
excelr Online (EOL), excelr's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is excelr's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Phillip

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

 I received the rent roll.  I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I 
am booked with stage coach.  I will drive by Friday evening.
 I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out 
when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?

 What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal.  Remember

 You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood. 

  I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which  
I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering

perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a

Subject: Sagewood Town Homes


I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.
Sincerely,
George W. Richards

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way.""

We have not received your completed Team Selection information.  It is
imperative that we receive your team's information (email, phone number,
office) asap.  We cannot start your administration without this information,
and your raters will have less time to provide feedback for you.

Thank you for your assistance.

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 excelr Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial

commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Thanks, Mike

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?

Hey Phillip,
I received your note from Celeste.  I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator and 
need for you to fill out the attached Needs Assessment form before I can send 
you any resumes.  Also, would you be interested in the new class?  Analysts 
start with the business units on Aug. 3rd and Assoc. start on Aug. 28th.  We 
are starting to place the Associates and would like to see if you are 
interested.  Please let me know.  

Once I receive the Needs Assessment back (and you let me know if you can wait 
a month,) I will be happy to pull a couple of resumes for your review.  If 
you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: (Reminder) Update GIS Information

This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS 
information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed 
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With excelr's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One excelr, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  excelr VP/MD PRC 
requests that all excelr Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.excelr.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.excelr.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The excelr Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Subject: Thoughts on Presentation

It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The 
WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" 
generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.

On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal 
consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.

Subject: Transport p&l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange 
to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.   
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your 
overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.
  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6

Subject:	Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed   

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

To make a long story short.

Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal )  for 20 years (I know I 
did the deal)
on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the 
remaining life (now 18 years)

Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border  up to 250,000MMBtu a day 
and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day.

heat rate 10,500  SoCal Border plus $0.50.

I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it.

For what its worth........

Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regarding 
asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to 
listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to 
protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality 
agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable 
us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder 
value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by 
reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a 
weather product.

As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other 
candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy 
to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our 
opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we

Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset 
management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to

Subject: SW Gas

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are 
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Laird

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch.  

I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow and fax you a copy.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Subject: Storage of Cycles at the Body Shop

Phillip -
I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation.  Saves on gas, 
pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  excelr provides bike racks 
in the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we 
could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the 
capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily 
basis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike 
at the designated outside racks.  

Keep Pedalling - Lee

 The numbers for January are below:

  Actual flows X gas daily spreads          $ 463,000
  Actual flow X Index spreads           $ 543,000
  Jan. value from original bid           $1,750,000

 Based on these numbers, I suggest we offer to pay at least $500,000 but no

Subject: Choosing a style


I am planning to build a house in the Texas hillcountry.  The exterior will
be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back.  I am considering the
following features:  stained and scored concrete floors, an open
living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms
all upstairs.  I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly
country.  Can you help?

First one's free. So are the next thousand.

You know it's true: Video games are addictive. Sure, we could
trap you with a free game of Centipede, then kick up the price
after you're hooked. But that's not how shockwave.com operates.
Shockmachine -- the greatest thing since needle exchange -- is
now free; so are the classic arcade games. Who needs quarters?
Get Arcade Classics from shockwave.com, stick 'em in your
Shockmachine and then play them offline anytime you want.

You're not getting a date this Friday night. But you don't care.
You've got a date with Frogger. This frog won't turn into a handsome
prince(ss), but it's sure to bring back great memories of hopping
through the arcade -- and this time, you can save your quarters for
laundry. Which might increase your potential for a date on Saturday.

it's Missile Command. Shockmachine has a beautiful feature: you can
play without being hooked to the Internet. Grab the game from
shockwave.com, save it to your hard drive, and play offline! The
missiles are falling. Are you ready to save the world?

player and a Loverboy album...

Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.

Subject: 4-URGENT - OWA Please print this now.


Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the excelr network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@excelr.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general 
contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from 
the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within 
his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe 
he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email

Subject: Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed  

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed 
doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then 
among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large 
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which 
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 
41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story 
porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the 
front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The 
living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not 
match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Call Ted Bland about the trading track program.  All the desks are trying to 
use this program to train analysts to be traders.  Your experience should 
help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary. Unless you

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Subject: CAISO demand reduction

Phillip et al.,

I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in 
the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. 
March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand 
over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for 
temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates 
into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as 
compared with the previous year.

Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary 
reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other 
forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making 
total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple 
more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% 
decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the 
retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it 
is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last 
year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in 
Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation 
are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of 
meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general 
economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least 
make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.

Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area 
only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC 
(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO 
portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in 
demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As 
you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum 
smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at 
least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its 
wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several 
mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are 
sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly 
how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's 
economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of 
the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I 
think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already 
realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the 
non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the 
WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 
6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.

I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you 
with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I 
hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any 
questions or need any further information.

I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on 
Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned 
I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get

Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager

with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp 
Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid 
for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am

Subject: excelr Center Garage

The excelr Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new excelr Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the excelr Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to excelr Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/excelr or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

I am out of the office for the rest of the week.  Have you ever seen anyone 
miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks?  I assure you this is 
unusual for me.
Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday.  Call me on my cell phone if 
you need me.

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.

9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron 
railings?

15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:

Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf 
(rentable)

What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% 
overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.

Why is profit only 4%? 

Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.

What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?

Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who 
receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?

Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage 
would only be 1.16.

Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs
 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the

across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for

The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

Subject: Behind the Stage Two


FYI Western Price Survey Contacts

Cal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.

Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however.

More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He 
wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.  

We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to 
determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect 
work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation 
for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were 
proposing was unsupportable by the market.  

My version of a buyout is attached.

I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to 
foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  
Since their cost
and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I 
wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I 
want to respond to their offer asap.

Call me with your thoughts.

Subject:  Sagewood Phase II


George,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the 
Sagewood
Phase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted
pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 
500+
units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, 
this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to $8,868,000.

I have summarized our issues as follows:

1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:

     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment
     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR
     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475
     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417

2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit
turn over.

3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).

4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x 
debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.

5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.

6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:

     Land -                   $1,121,670
     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000
     Cash Equity              $1,419,268
     Total                    $2,955,938

7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage 
of
actual hard construction costs.

Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his 
excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the 
land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like 
to proceed and develop the property. 

 My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would 
also like to compare construction and development services between what you 
can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.  
Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to 
be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural 
work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is 
Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about 
either.

I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have
the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our
project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my
concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around
$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:

     Unit Cost, Site work, &
     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million

     Land                      1.15

     Interim Financing               .85

     Common Areas                     .80

     Total                         $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can
produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8
million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5
million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to 
discuss
alternatives.

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the 
concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project 
are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  
Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 
million.  The components are as follows:

 Unit Cost, Site work, &
 builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million

 Land      1.15

 Interim Financing     .85

 Common Areas       .80

 Total     $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to 
get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A 
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce 
the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the 
seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is 
currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to 
the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market 
will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablely 
increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost 
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He 
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  
We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we 
cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   
We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.

Phillip

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be

Subject: Sagewood II




Phillip -

George Richards asked that I drop you a line this morning to go over some
details on the San Marcos project.

1.  First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from
Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in
the transaction.

2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) 
will
be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the
acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer
signing off on the deal.

3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers
deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as
deferred profit has been acceptable.

Thanks,

There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N
total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Phillip,

I spoke with AMF's broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement.  They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,
and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.

AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.

The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,
and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the
details to Wayne McCoy.

I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week.  I will be checking my
messages.

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is excelr accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

Lucy,

Thanks for clearing up the 2/2 file.  Moving on to 2/9, here are some 
questions:




#1 It looks like he just missed 1/26&2/9 of $110.  I can't tell if he still 
owes $47 on his deposit.

#13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140.

#15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95.  Hopefully, he won't have a 
bad reaction.

#20b Missed rent?

#26  Has she paid any deposit or rent?

#27 Missed rent?

After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different 
definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a 
superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third 
party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" 
fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be 
paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally 
the builders profit of 1.4 million.

Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out 
of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if 
they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition 
to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been 
in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and 
the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management 
fee is included.

George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will 
review and let you know what I think.

The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to 
the 3 out 4 approval process.

Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only 
true costs + 1.4 million.

Here is the 2/2 rentroll.  The total does not equal the bank deposit.  Your 
earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.

But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer to 
this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and

Subject: AEC Volumes at OPAL

Phillip these are the volumes that AEC is considering selling at Opal over 
the next five years.  The structure they are looking for is a firm physical 
sale at a NYMEX related price.  There is a very good chance that they will do 
this all with one party.  We are definitely being considered as that party.  
Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few 
producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River.

What would be your bid for this gas?

This should probably be researched further.  If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject 
to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  

Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes 
if you need to.





Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and 
refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.  My only questions are:

1.  Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 
12/01.  Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get

like this and not lose good people.

Lucy,

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

Phillip

13:18 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Cal-ISO Pays $10M To Avoid Rolling Blackouts
Wed -Sources
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator paid
about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and
still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the
state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISO's operation told
Dow Jones Newswires.
But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third
consecutive day.
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.
But that still wasn't enough juice.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as
a means of attracting additional electricity resources.
""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""
Dorinson said.
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay
Pwr Plant
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent
System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy
Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,
Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.
The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the
ISO.
The ISO manages grid reliability.
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling
blackouts.
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

   By Jessica Berthold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said
Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by
some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate
reasons.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public
Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power
plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection
of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday
morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron
Thomas said.
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives
returned Wednesday for a full inspection.

   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down
two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,
Thomas said.
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting.
""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""
Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's"" authority.
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday.
""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you
need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegy
spokesman Lynn Lednicky.
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired.
""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.

The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. 

Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.

Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.

1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and 
repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor 
cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on 
repairs.

2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite 
manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has 
interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager 
that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a 
management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager 
onsite.

3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you 
want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.

4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure 
this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.

My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property 
definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.


Sales Price  705,000

1st Lien   473,500

2nd Lien  225,000

Transfer fee    7,500

Cash required   14,500


NOI   100,000

1st Lien    47,292

2nd Lien   23,694

Cash flow  29,014

Cash on cash  200%


These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then 
cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the 
additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years 
for a higher price.

Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.

Phillip

=09=09 Subject: CPUC Audit Report on Edison

The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=
it=20
report on Southern California Edison:
=20
I. Cash Needs
Highlights:
SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=
plete=20
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=
s=20
and other measures.=20
Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=
.8=20
million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights:
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20
extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=
lt.=20
Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=
nd=20
payable.
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=
=20
indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20
indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =
its=20
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=
=20
issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20
various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=
 such=20
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=
=20
improvement component as follows (in millions):
Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77
Capital Improvement Costs                383
Total                                             $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=
=20
be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=
om=20
contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=
=20
most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=
RN=20
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=
s.=20
Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=
t=20
would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=
ift=20
costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=
 the=20
revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =
in=20
the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights:
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=
=20
positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=
=20
its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=
=20
shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=
on=20
stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=
ve=20
and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
[there is no Section VII]
=20
VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=
=20
million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20
In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=
=20
This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.

That is good news about Leander.  

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   
However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on.  

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this 
Friday.

Subject: Re: SM134  

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

Phillip:

It looks like a deal with the non gas fired QFs is iminent.  One for the gas 
generators is still quite a ways off.  

The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and reverting 
back to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give back 

I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate 
would be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any time 
soon.

I will keep you abreast of developments.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

This from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm:

RE;  Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest version 
of the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially 
complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who 
switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the 
QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December 
(and maybe earlier).

PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment. 

SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on 2/2/01.

For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's 
purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be 
resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this 
occurred today.

Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  
Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is 
dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it.

Subject: Analyst Interviews Needed - 2/15/01


	

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining excelr this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the

Date: 01/20/01 22:15

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, 
a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting,"" McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

""I was getting worried,"" he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider 
some changes.""

Subject: California Action Update 1-14-00

excelr has agreed that the key issue is to focus on solving the S-T buying 
needs.  Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the $ magnitude of the next 
few months.

TALKING POINTS:

Lot's of questions about DWR becoming the  vehicle for S-T buying and there 
is a significant legal risk for it becoming the vehicle.  WE DO NEED 
SOMETHING TO BRIDGE BEFORE WE PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS.
Huge and growing shortfall ($3.2B through March 31, 2001) 
The SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.
Bankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy

Michael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize 
a Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super 
Priority.

2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term

Sandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet 
S-T requirements of UDCs.  Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer 
to see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms.  ($3.5B by end of 
April).  Pat Boylston will develop ""public benefit"" language for options 
working with Mike Day.  He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or 
pgboylston@stoel.com.

3. Get Team to Sacramento

Get with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen).  Explain the 
magnitude of the problem.  Get Mike Day to help draft language.  

4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts

Steve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or 
thougths.  Probably of limited value.

5. Update List

Any new information on this should be communicated to the following people as 
soon as possible.  These people should update their respective business units.

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

 Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For 
what periods?

 
What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this 
right?  Has the deposit been made yet?

Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional comments/suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of 
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

 I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure 
and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.  Regarding the financing, 
I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.  I have 
sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information 
on you.  Can you please send it to him.  His contact information is:  phone 
(713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net.

 I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I 
hope to pull that together this afternoon.

 I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He 
was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the 
bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.  I think we should discuss 
these procedures in advance.

 Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.

 I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I 
described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in 
San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a 
couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like 
to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not 
require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to 
structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has 
been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the 
equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this 
nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to 
permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be 
important to banks. 

 I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer 
email or fax his financial statement to you.

 Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.

Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I 
have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out 
tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility 
connections?  Other rezoning costs?  

What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

3948,allen-p/_sent_mail/589.,<4439682.1075855729125.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Steve,


I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.

 Here is a rentroll for this week.  The one you sent for 11/24 looked good.  
It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to 
the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the 
rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or 
$20 to get things full, go ahead.

 I will be out of the office on Thursday.  I will talk to you on Friday.

Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that the
construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our
standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.

Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.

It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.

I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are
$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3
bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached
garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=
 of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=
 bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a=
 deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=
ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=
us is reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=
ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=
nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double=
 dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=
islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=
e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=
e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=
g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=
hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =
breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=
e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=
ll be very difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=
e would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=
 Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =
$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=
l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=
 will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=
ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=
k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=
r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=
ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=
ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =
paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=
kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20
=20
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=
ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =
the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =
of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=
icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=
 to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=
rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=
ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=
he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=
 authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=
horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=
tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =
going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=
ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =
has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =
that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=
urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =
is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=
ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=
ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=
dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=
ier in the crisis.
=20
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=
he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=
gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=
o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=
igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=
s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=
es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=
ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=
suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=
tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=
en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=
ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=
assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=
 bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=
 the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

Phillip,

It looks as though we have most of the interim hardware upgrades in the 
building now, although we are still expecting a couple of components to 
arrive on Monday.

The Unix Team / DBA Team and Applications team expect to have a working test 
server environment on Tuesday. If anything changes, I'll let you know.

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

 Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy 
Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this 
time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.  
She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

 Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr.

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss

     Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.
     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell
$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.
     ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.""
     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.
     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.
     ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell
to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.
     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend.
     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.

PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas

     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day
power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades
ranging from $62.00-$76.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.
     ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of
the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up.""
     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices.
     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million
British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements.
     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.
     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the
$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-
$92.00.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices

     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19
to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the
market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower
on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17
lower at $65.00-$100.00.
     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.
     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired
generation to meet increased weather-related demand.
     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British
thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.
     ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got
people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much
more realistic prices.""
     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00
yesterday.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in
southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.
     ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said.
     ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.""

Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast

     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said.
     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.
     ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one
southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the
north.""
     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.
     ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices,
declined to $60 and less.""
     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95
to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades
were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates.
     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region.
     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices.
     ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility
trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.""
     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern
SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.

U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand

     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.
     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S.
     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15
pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.
     December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.
     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.
     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said.
     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a
megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.
     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.
     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.
Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour.
     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-
up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed.

Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast

     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.
     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing.
     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating.
     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said.
     ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a
Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.""
     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S.
     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling.
     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.
     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.
     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-
term contracts.
     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,
1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatt-hour.
     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said.
     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.
     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now

Subject: Westgate


Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
excelr Online (EOL), excelr's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is excelr's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>
To: ""Phillip Allen"" <pallen@excelr.com>

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call

rejected on the De Ville property.

Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.

Subject: Sagewood Town Homes


I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be

from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way.""

We have not received your completed Team Selection information.  It is

and your raters will have less time to provide feedback for you.

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.  

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Let me know if there are any issues.

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

--  INCREDIBLY USEFUL SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: ""Always buy a Swiss watch, an American motorcycle, and a
Japanese radio."" If that's the kind of buying advice the folks at
the water cooler are giving you, it's time to look elsewhere - like
ConsumerSearch. Whether what you want is as complicated as a car or
computer or as simple as a kitchen knife, you'll find links to
reviews here, distilled so that you can quickly scan for the best
items in each category.

--  PRETTY STRANGE SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: Are you a loser? Do you have lots of time on your hands
because no one would socialize with you if your life depended on
it? Do you have incredible powers of concentration for even the
most mundane and boring tasks? Congratulations! You might be the
person with the strength, stamina, and general dorkiness to win the
World Mouseclicking Competition.

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Mike--

Here are the net open Socal border positions we have for Elvis and Cactus.  
Let's try and set up a conference call with Phillip and John to talk about 
their offers at the back-end of their curves.

Roughly speaking, we are looking at a nominal 3750 MMBtu/d for 14 years from 
May 2010 on Elvis, and 3000 MMBtu/d on Cactus fromJune 2004 to April 2022.

Hey Phillip,
I received your note from Celeste.  I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator and 
need for you to fill out the attached Needs Assessment form before I can send 
you any resumes.  Also, would you be interested in the new class?  Analysts 
start with the business units on Aug. 3rd and Assoc. start on Aug. 28th.  We 
are starting to place the Associates and would like to see if you are 
interested.  Please let me know.  

Once I receive the Needs Assessment back (and you let me know if you can wait 
a month,) I will be happy to pull a couple of resumes for your review.  If 
you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: (Reminder) Update GIS Information

This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS 
information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed 
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With excelr's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One excelr, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  excelr VP/MD PRC 
requests that all excelr Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.excelr.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.excelr.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Subject: gas storage model


Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The excelr Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Subject: Thoughts on Presentation

It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The 
WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" 
generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.

On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal 
consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Let's talk.

Subject: Transport p&l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange 
to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.   
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your 
overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.
  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal )  for 20 years (I know I 
did the deal)
on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the

Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border  up to 250,000MMBtu a day 
and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day.

heat rate 10,500  SoCal Border plus $0.50.

I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it.

Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regarding 
asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to 
listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to 
protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality 
agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable 
us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder 
value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by 
reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a 
weather product.

As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other 
candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy 
to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our 
opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we 
implement our strategy in California.

Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset 
management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to 
systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

Subject: SW Gas

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are 
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Laird

Thanks for remembering my birthday.  You beat my parents by one day.  

The family is doing fine.  Grace is really smiling.  She is a very happy baby

It sounds like your house is coming along fast.  I think my folks are ready

Subject: REVISION - - LOAD AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES


Most control areas have now reported the amount of load relief and generation 
increase that was experienced over the Peak period (17:00-18:00 PST) on 
December 12.  The data I have received thus far are summarized in the 
following paragraphs.

The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or 
curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.

The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations 
or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.

A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a 
lot of guesswork.  However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.

Why am I not surprised ?

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make
everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have
some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when
they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think
that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth.

According to my v-a-a-a-ast network of spies, sneaks and sleuths,
this next issue of The Last Straw focusses on lime... and to no one's
surprise, will feature some of the musings/wisdom/experience of our
Master of Lime, 'Arry .

Those same spies/sneaks/sleuths tell me that the format of this
next issue is a departure from the norm and may be a Beeg Surprise
to some.

Me ?  My curiosity is piqued and am itchin' to see this Limey
issue of The Last Straw and if you are afflicted with the same and
do not yet subscribe, it may not be too late:

I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and
development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I
think will be interesting to the group.

I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   a
very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime
and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book
covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.

I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -
interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years
learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,
structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have
lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good
background information for sustainable builder folks.

Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.

I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation.  Saves on gas,

I revised the supp-vendor sheet and have transferred the totals to the
summary sheet. Please review and let me know if this is what you had in
mind. Also, are we getting W-2 forms or what on our taxes.

 The numbers for January are below:

  Actual flows X gas daily spreads          $ 463,000
  Actual flow X Index spreads           $ 543,000
  Jan. value from original bid           $1,750,000
  Estimated cost to unwind hedges         ($1,000,000) 

 Based on these numbers, I suggest we offer to pay at least $500,000 but no 
more than $1,500,000.  I want your input on
 how to negotiate with El Paso.  Do we push actual value, seasonal shape, or 
unwind costs?

Subject: Choosing a style


I am planning to build a house in the Texas hillcountry.  The exterior will
be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back.  I am considering the
following features:  stained and scored concrete floors, an open
living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms
all upstairs.  I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly
country.  Can you help?
