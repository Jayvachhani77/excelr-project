Thanks for the information on the GB 58. This boat far exceeds what I want. 
After the show I concluded that  either a 42 or 46 foot classic is most

Thanks for the info though and keep me in mind. I enjoyed talking to you at 
the boat show and my wife was quite sold on the GB line (after looking at 
most everything there in detail).

As I mentioned I am in no particular rush as I probably have a year before I

Subject: SK-excelr Korean Won exposure

Rick,

I wanted to touch base with you regarding our Korean Won exposure.  As you 
know, a remaining issue involves who is responsible for these types of hedges 
Corp or business unit.   

The currency traders on Hickerson's desk contacted me today.  They mentioned 
that it is an appropriate time to put a currency hedge in place for 3 reasons:

1.) The spot rate has fallen back to the 1230 KRW/USD level
2.) The forward rate is relatively flat as there is no signifcant difference 
in 1 year rates between the two currencies.
3.) Option volatilities have decreased significantly over the past month.

Please let me know if (when?) we should discuss this issue further.  The 
currency traders mentioned that they will bubble this issue up with Jim 
Hughes again later today.  

Thanks,

Rudi

		 To: All RAC Houston & London Employees
		 cc: 
		 Subject: RAC Teams

As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams 
that we are forming to better address the business needs of excelr as it 
expands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided 
the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be 
adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but 
others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be 
multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each 
member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC 
group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process 
for consideration.

- The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the 
commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework.
- Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened 
awareness of RAC issues. ""De-silo-ization"" .
- All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.
- Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude 
among the teams.
- Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.
-  Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will 
require more frequent informal meetings.
- There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of 
credit, market risk or our portfolio.
- All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to 
help out if needed.
- If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.
- Encourage weak links in team to perform.
- Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business 
unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement.
- If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it 
with your supervisor.
- Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC

that we are forming to better address the business needs of excelr as it 
expands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided 
the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be 
adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but 
others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be 
multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each 
member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC 
group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process 
for consideration.

- The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the 
commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework.
- Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened 
awareness of RAC issues. ""De-silo-ization"" .
- All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.
- Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude 
among the teams.
- Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.
-  Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will 
require more frequent informal meetings.
- There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of 
credit, market risk or our portfolio.
- All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to 
help out if needed.
- If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.
- Encourage weak links in team to perform.
- Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business 
unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement.
- If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it 
with your supervisor.
- Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC 
and compensation processes.

Mr. Buy,

We are looking at sale of a percentage on producing gas plays (domestic),
and seeking working interest investment in E&P international (various
regions).

I can forward a brief outline if you'd prefer.

this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management 
and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for 
$120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating 
expenses for PCB activities in California.

The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air 
permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns 
brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email 
was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added 
to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the 
draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for 
Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from 
the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of 
this week. 

Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.

Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance 
monitoring report  for C/S No.7.

A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by 
PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last 
several months.   Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and 
proposed PCB activities on the PG&E system for 2002. ",Non Abusive

Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for 
the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily 
set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This 
means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the 
allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This 
generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be 
operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority 
to apply a 10%safety factor.

For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers 
guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears 
that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit 
limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions 
limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.

Northern Natural Gas Company

A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to 
the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 
emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V 
facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not 
greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being 
conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. 

EOTT
A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove 
the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data 
on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for 
VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit. 

General

Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held 
next week in Albuquerque.

Subject: BTU factor


Due to internal issues, the BTU factor, previously reported to the marketers
for the month of August 2000 as 1.027, was incorrect.


The correct BTU factor for August 2000 is 1.029.

Any questions may be directed to my attention.

43121,campbell-l/_sent_mail/11.,<20973311.1075851923349.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA=
=20
permits for 3 and 4.  Briefly here they are.

First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours=
=20
of operation for the generator.  The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation=
=20
because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.  In talking to=20
Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all=20
applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not=20
triggered.   This is there policy not regulation.  What is ironic is that=
=20
they accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that=
=20
they would apply any safety factor for their comfort.  Im concerned about t=
he=20
time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.  I need=
=20
some guidance.  Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how lon=
g=20
it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic=20
converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?  In speakin=
g=20
with Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches th=
e=20
PSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro=
l=20
technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.  I know=
=20
time is of the essence.

Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and=
=20
4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr=
=20
or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppm=
vd=20
for NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, =
at=20
lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are=
=20
40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.  We cant live with this.  In our application, we=
=20
stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we=
=20
applied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented=
=20
this in lb.hr and tons/yr.  This would have covered us, but because the=20
permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed  these limits during low loads=
=20
and low temps.  I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit=20
conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with=
=20
with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou=
ld=20
bring this before his management.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.

which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.  The most 
critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really 
restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines.  
We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.  Let me 
know what additional information you may need. 


1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest
Operations.

2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based
on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.  At 60F
and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all
operating conditions.  However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as 
high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.

The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of
the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20%
of the time.  TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of
reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.  The potential
to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of
lb/hr and ton/yr.  These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA
for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA
Statement of Basis document). Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd
values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that
under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the
emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is
requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows
emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that
the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.

3. The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires
Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not
normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas.
Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel
monitoring schedules to use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or
gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the
natural gas.",Non Abusive

I think that I might have seen that face somewhere before, in fact that
could be one of our faces.  I found out last week that I didn't get drawn
for the deer/hog hunt that I have gone on the last two years.  Are you going
to take Ryan hunting?  If so when and where.  Right now Daniel is tied up
with being football manager and we don't get to do much.  Thanks for the air
force song that you sent, I got a big kick out of it.  I have been going to
a seminar call ""Making your children mind without loosing yours"" by a man
named Kevin Leman.  It has been really good and is Biblically based.  He has
a book out by the same name that I would highly recommend.

Later,
Randy

we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of 
I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on 
the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east 
side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking 
into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed 
construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the 
potential of becoming an ""opportunity"" in the event we are forced to deal 
with them.  I appreciate your wirk in this......

Subject: RE: Review Draft  - Sundevil Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report


Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
Thanks,  Scott

Subject: Additional Note


By the way, I got a call back from Greg Simmons in the BLM State Office in
Arizona - my question to him was whether or not a proposed ROW across the
Agua Fria National Monument would constitute a ""Fatal Flaw.""  He indicated
that it likely would be a fatal flaw.  He said that it would take ""an act of
congress"" literally, not figuratively, to put a pipeline across a National
Monument.  The boundary of the Monument is the east side of I 17, south of
Cordes Junction - I don't know if we can stay on the west side of the
Interstate there, but we might oughta check it out - it looks like we could
get into some pretty rough side-sloping, two-toning.  FYI.

As the Subject line would lead you to believe, I am attaching a further
refinement of our cost estimate, spread out over the life of the project.  I
know that you, Dave, requested a breakdown by personnel and hours, but I am
going to have to go home and pack for my trip.  We certainly can break this

Subject: Con Edison's Capacity Release/Delivery Service Programs for the 2=
=20
000/2001 Winter Season



As a result of feedback received at the July 6 reliability collaborative,
Con Edison has made the following changes to its capacity release/delivery
service programs for the 2000/2001 winter season.

First, to assist you in meeting your primary point obligations relating to
the firm load on our system that you are serving, Con Edison will make
available to Marketers 25,000 dt/day on Transco.  Your allocation based on
active customers in your group as of July 1, 2000 is
511 dt/day in the form of either:

  (a) a capacity release of Transco capacity at the
Transco maximum
   rate for the 12-month period November 2000 through
October 2001,
   or

  (b) a bundled citygate sale for November 2000 through
March 2001 priced
   as follows:

*  Inside F.E.R.C.=01,s first of the month index price at
    Transco/Zone 3 (Station 65) plus $1.00/dt.

 or;

  (c) a combination of the two adding up to 511 dt per
day.


Second, in addition to the above, we can make available to you 204 dt/day
during March 2001 as a bundled citygate sale on the same terms as set forth
above.

Third, with respect to the balance of capacity that you may require to meet
your primary point obligations,

  (a) There will be no citygate allocation requirements
for this winter, except for the 25% limitation on Texas Eastern. (i.e., you
may deliver     all of your gas to any of the
following receipt points, except that no more than 25% may be delivered to
Texas Eastern.

       Transco (Receipt
Point: 134th Street - Manhattan, Central Manhattan, Narrows or Long Beach)

       Tennessee (Receipt
Point:  White Plains)

  (b) We will permit you to meet the primary point
requirement using your Daily Load Following Service Quantity (for Load
Following Service)  or Daily Load Quantity (for Daily Delivery Service)
during November instead of the Average Day/Peak Month quantity used during
the remaining four winter months.

  (c) Prior to the winter, you can trade all or part of
your citygate allocation on Texas Eastern to another marketer, so long as
the aggregate entitlement for deliveries on Texas Eastern among all
marketers remains below 25% of the combined total allocation.

Please let us know on or before close of business Friday, July 28, 2000
which, if any, of the above-described services you are interested in.

NOTES:
1. We will advise you if additional capacity becomes available as a
result of actions taken by other marketers.
2. Bundled sales service is subject to the execution of a written
agreement (on mutually agreeable terms), including a take-or-pay commitment
and resolution of any creditworthiness issues.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMAPNY

A conference call was held with Region IX EPA to discuss Redrock Expansion 
issues related to the issuance of Title V air permits for Sat. 3 and 4 which 
are on Indain lands.  The agency provided a tentative date of 7 weeks before 
the the permits would be issued.  The EPA has required Transwestern to 
respond to issues related to the Endangered Species Act prior to issuance of 
the air permit.  Transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological 
assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 3 and 4.

A meeting was held with the Arizona DEQ to discuss what activities 
Transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the 
air permits for Station 1 and 2.  The agency gave a date of April 2002 as a 
normal issue date.  Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to 
be mid December of this year.  Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's 
management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased.  
On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction 
activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation 
construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant 
underground structures. This wil benefit the inbitiation of the Redrock 
construction prior to receivng the air permits for these stations.

Subject: RE: mea culpa



  Public Statement by the Rev. Jesse Jackson

  Due to the great consternation caused by the
  revelation of my act of procreation, I accept my
  obligation to give an explanation to the
  population for my act of copulation.

  I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of
  sexual gratification, that I could not obtain through
  masturbation, resulted in my fornication.
   I accepted her invitation, and provided her with
  excitation, stimulation, penetration, replication, and
  liberation.

  She provided lubrication (to avoid inflammation) and I
  wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried  for
  duplication but I insisted upon
  termination, in spite of her fascination with
  variation.

  This has caused me great aggravation, and the
  agitation and provocation of the media has resulted in
  my humiliation, denigration, and
  degradation. My wife is considering castration, which
  would require my hospitalization.

  Pray that this matter will find culmination in my
  sanctification and rehabilitation so that my plans for
  nomination to my ultimate vocation will not result in
  revocation and termination.I hope this proclamation
  has provided illumination and verification and will
  prohibit further provocation (or investigation).

  Sincerely,
  The Rev. Jesse Jackson

this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management 
and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 
(86%).  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses 
for PCB activities in California.  On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph 
Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their 
system and are presented below:

SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on 
portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.  It is these 
portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to 
declassify.  These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal 
system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the 
fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor 
stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot 
California.  Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, 
it appears  the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline 
areas.    

SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss 
the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides 
natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.  The location 
of this  interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca.

Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 
interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.  As you know, Transwetern 
supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 
2 separators will be approx. $33,000 plus installation charges.  Ralph stated 
that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002.  Of 
note, Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side 
of the interconnect which means that maintenance and operation of each 
separator will be SoCal's responsiblility.  these charges will be passed on 
to Transwestern at 86%.",Non Abusive

he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this 
matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his

could choose this avenue if we desired.

would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why  
Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air 
permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to 
ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information 
required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were 
expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a 
September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that 
energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I 
phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept 
aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, 
both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we 
approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were 
conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional 
time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else 
could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure 
that the permits would be issued in a timely manner.",Non Abusive

issue:

[Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 
and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status 
of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.]

I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to 
another group (compliance) in the air permit section.  They strongly 
suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, 
Director of the ADEQ.  I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ 
compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back 
from her.  Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again, 
tomorrow.

Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to 
have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air 
permits:

 all earthwork
 trench construction and piping tie ins
 all foundation and building construction
 installation of ancillary equipment

This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may 
allow us to do.

The EPA contact for the Sta. 3 and 4 air permits: permit engineer  Roger 
Cohn      (415) 744-1238
      Supervisor  Geraldo Rios    (415) 744-1259

Concerning the agenda, the first day is devoted to presentations.  The second 
moring will be devoted to a  ""surprise"" participation at a local compressor 
station about 45 miles west of Albuquerque.  I havent spread this around yet, 
except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but  I plan on dividing the guys into 
groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor 
station.  I plan on setting and hiding  some placebo environmental issues the 
night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other 
housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit.  We will then convine 
back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they 
would address the issues identified.  The group that identifies the most 
issues, will get a small gift.  Do I need your approval on the spending of 
some $$$ for a gift?  I was thinking of a couple of $25 gift certificates for 
the two winners at a big sporting goods store and let them choose what they 
want.  The final afternoon session will be devoted to mock environmental 
situations under varying circumstances, like we did last year with the whole 
group being divided into four individuals and participating as teams.

Subject: ADEQ permits: public hearing


As Larry has probably reported to you by now, the public hearing last night 
in Williams was accomplished with a satisfactory result. Shudeish had copies 
of the draft permits, which Larry reviewed and found satisfactory. 
Apparently, about three weeks ago, Prabhat Bargava left his DEQ position as 
Section Manager, Compliance, to take a position with a consultant, CH2M Hill, 
which is trying to start an air group in Arizona.
I just spoke with Shudeish about how soon the actual permits will be issued. 
He said that DEQ had to wait a few days after the November 23 close of the 
comment period (this was announced at the hearing) to allow mailed comments 
postmarked on Friday, Nov 23 to reach DEQ. He then said that he expected both 
permits would be issued middle to end of next week (by Nov. 30): he said he 
had to blend the EPA issues into the permits, but that was not problemmatic. 
Larry talked with Shudeish last night about the EPA issues, and that did not 
seem to be any difficulty.
I then asked Shudeish why the comment period was extended until Nov 23 when 
the rule states that the comment period is only 30 days long and the comment 
period opened by first publication on October 17. The public hearing also 
must be no sooner than 30 days after first publication, and that is why it 
was set for Nov. 19. Thus, even allowing for a couple of days after what 
should have been the close of comment period (Nov 19, because Nov 17 was a 
Saturday), the permits should be issued by the first of next week rather than 
the end of the week. Shudeish said he would check and get back to me.
I know this is only a couple of days difference (assuming the permits are 
issued by Nov 30), but I am sensitive to Jerry's urgency to get moving 
quickly, and I also want to lay some groundwork to object if actual issuance 
starts dragging.
Please let me know if you have any thoughts or comments.

Subject: Sun Devil - Helicopter Fly-Over of Routes


	

Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the ""fatal-flaw"" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events 
coordinated.  John Shafer

Meeting Planning Team,
This like it is on target at this point.  You should probably circulate the
draft to Pribble, after you are comfortable with it, to get his preliminary
buy-in.  Now, I do have a few questions.  Is someone talking with the
Little America Hotel in Flagstaff and blocking out enough rooms for our
meeting?  When can we get some preliminary dates (How about the week of
April 22, 2002?)???   If that week is not good, then go to the second week
in May as I will have serious conflicts with the first week of May.  Also,
who will be in charge of planning the evening dinners?  I would like to
talk with that person as I have a couple of ""fun"" ideas to offer about
where we might go for dinner.  Thanks to both the North Safety Team and the
SW Environmental Team for taking a lead role in this.  John

an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed

group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.  I 
told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that 
the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken 
care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.  (As you remember, the Navajo Nation 
verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station 
sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the 
Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a 
call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys 
with the EPA.  Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as 
to whether surveys would be required or not.  I told him that we were 
expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would 
schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.  He advised me not to 
do this.  I think his decision had something to do with  the EPA usurping 
authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without 
Indian consent.  He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to 
whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo 
Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these

Thanks, Donna.
The reason I ask is that we've been fighting a long political/policy issue 
here in Washington on rights-of-way across federal lands.  
Thus far the issue has focused on telecommunications (EBS and fiber optic 
cables).  The agencies we've been pitted against are the BLM and Forest 
Service, and the issue is the federal land agencies have tried to raise ROW 
fees and rents to exorbitant levels in order to get more money out of 
companies.
The agencies have recently said that what they tried to do to fiber cables 
they'll also do to pipelines.  
Two weeks ago, I spoke at a pipelines conference in New Orleans on this 
issue.  El Paso pipelines told me they've had a tough time getting 
compression station upgrade permits from the BLM for their pipeline expansion 
into California.
My request therefore would only be that IF you have any problems with the 
Forest Service in obtaining permits or new rights-of-way, and you think you 
might need some help, please feel free to let me know.  We meet regularly 
with Dept of Agriculture senior staff, and should soon meet with the new 
Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth.  We could help if you have any problems.
(Can't help you with the Navajo Nation, though!  But seriously, we'd always 
like to learn if you have problems on Indian lands as well.)

Larry,
(Caveat: The following is just an observation at this point and the view 
expressed is my own).  What concerns me most about this scenario is that we 
pressured the EPA Region IX quite a lot to get this permit and now we are 
just going to let a portion of it go ""null and void"".  At least, the portion 
applicable to Station 4.  I know we didn't lean on the EPA as hard as we did 
the AZDEQ, but we did repeatedly call them.  Even the FERC Environmental 
Staff was calling Region IX asking when were they going to get the draft out 
- because the FERC was under the assumption that we needed all or none.  

At a time when excelr's veracity has come into question all across America, 
its too bad there isn't a better way to handle this.  Don't be surprised the 
next time you go in asking for expedited treatment on a federal air permit, 
if the regulators look at you with a ""question"" mark.  I wouldn't say we 
""burned bridges"", but we definitely used some ""green stamps"".  There are only 
so many ""green stamps"" that we can use with an agency and we used a bundle on 
this one - and now we don't need it.  John

New land pegged for preservation


By ANNE MINARD
Sun Staff Reporter
07/29/2001

  |
Reader Comments

It's been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly
rejected Proposition 100, a plan to protect 290,000
acres of State Trust Land from development.
And in about a month, voters could be asked to begin
signing petitions to get another initiative on the
ballot that would protect significantly more of the
state's legacy -- 1 million acres, or about 10 percent,
including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff.

The difference, conservationists say, is that this land
has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically
and aesthetically important areas. The environmental
community rallied against Prop. 100 because they said
the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and
had little value for conservation.

For example, the Proposition 100 campaign identified 10
acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff -- near a
wastewater treatment plant outflow -- as one of the
state's ""crown jewels"" needing to be preserved.

Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included 15
acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an
industrial park and 269 acres of steep slopes littered
with shot-up refrigerators and television sets called
Turkey Hills.

Rogers Lake, an important wetland and major ecosystem
south of Flagstaff, was also slated for preservation
under Prop 100. But that plan only included its soggy
lakebed, while 2,000 acres of highly developable
shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was
still up for grabs.

THE NEW PLAN

The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers
Lake, excluding those that are private or held by the
U.S. Forest Service. One proposed parcel does still fall
in the Turkey Hills area, and three others lie between
Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon (not included is
Section 20, which is likely to be sold and developed,
but at densities that are still in dispute between the
county and the city).

Other areas would include parcels around Observatory
Mesa (a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the
Naval Observatory) and a checkerboard pattern of
sections -- interspersed with Forest Service land --
south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and
Griffiths Spring.

Like Prop. 100, an initiative would be only a first
step. If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass,
it would take an act of Congress, and a constitutional
amendment, to change the availability of State Trust
Lands.

State Trust Lands include about 135 million acres across
the country -- 9.3 million in Arizona -- originally
allocated by the federal government when each state was
formed to help fund public schools. (See related story
on Page A11.)

Brad Ack, program director for the Flagstaff-based Grand
Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative,
said the state's schools shouldn't be bought and paid
for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl. Areas set aside
under the initiative could still be leased for grazing,
agriculture or other current uses -- but they would
never be sold for commercial development.

Making an informed decision to set aside designated
State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that
now accompany proposals to develop them, he said.

The initiative is a collaborative effort between the
Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups, along
with some business and development affiliates.

And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by
the Grand Canyon Trust, the Sonoran Institute in Tucson
and the Nature Conservancy that showed 88 percent of
Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizona's State Trust
Land should be conserved.

TALKING COMPENSATION

But members of the State Department of Lands charged
with managing the tracts -- and a lobbyist for
superintendents and principals in the state's school
system -- say the initiative backers are missing the
mark in the state land debate.

""We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our
friends in the environmental community,"" said Mike
Smith, a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School
Administrator Association. ""Preserve, set aside ... we
think those are great ideas. The question is
compensation. Those State Trust Lands are in trust for
the schools. It's acutely important for schools to
maximize the returns on state lands.""

Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is
new for the state's schools. Until recently, the schools
didn't see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts.

""We haven't seen any of it. The state Legislature has
taken the annual earnings, and has used it to reduce
state aid coming out of the general fund.""

That all changed with the passage of Proposition 301,
passed last year, he said.

""In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools ...
they also said, 'By the way, all new earnings from the
state trust fund go into the school site fund.' All of a
sudden, it's real different for us. Before it supplanted
our funding, now it will supplement it. It's real money
to us.""

The Legislature will still keep the money it has been
earning from State Trust Lands -- about $80 million a
year. But anything above that mark will now go to the
schools, and both Smith and Nick Simonetta, manager of
communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona
Department of Lands, are optimistic that figure will
climb rapidly in the coming years. Simonetta estimates
the schools could see $650 million in addition to
legislative appropriations over the next decade.

LOOKING BACK

But the past irregularities are a stronghold for
conservationists who are promoting the land reform
initiative.

In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform
Initiative, the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State
Trust Lands haven't been used as they were intended
anyway, and very little money has gone to Arizona
schools.

""State Trust Lands currently provide less than 2 percent
of the annual funding for public education,"" the
document reads. ""... there is little, if any, direct
benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools.""

Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that
assessment.

""I think those statements are severely misleading and
not reflective of what is currently the case. You can
throw around percentages any way you want. If you look
at what the trust has been contributing to the school
construction budget, it's more like 30 or 40 percent.""

Regardless, Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of
State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate
funds -- and won't be given away for free.

""It comes down to this: We are in intense discussion
with the conservation community,"" Smith said. ""Our
conversations are all around the question of
compensation. We are not going to support any initiative
that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without
compensation. You can take that non-support as far as
you like. If they attempt to go to Congress, we are
going with them.""

submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency 
originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the 
TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the 
emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are 
the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 
inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 
tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would 
submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The 
only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an 
increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this 
facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from 
the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that 
the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I 
have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed 
for this facility in the near future.  

In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if 
there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit 
on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with 
previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that 
this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 
(emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed 
from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating 
throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make

C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this 
issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further 
actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was 
received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of 
interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing 
smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide 
vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to 
simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received 
permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, 
Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher 
turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not 
make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by 
Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is 
authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern 
from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this 
turbine at their descretion.

In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a 
emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than 
the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 
were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be 
mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple 
cycle.   

  Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to 
be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the 
Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern

they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring 
sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel 
monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them 
otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer 
for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also 
an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions 
from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.

Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for 
the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also 
approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There 
are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment 
period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it

Larry  - Sorry for the delay, but with PRC, life in HR has been pretty
intense.  I also made some initial contacts with the RMEF and have only
managed to play phone tag with the people I really needed to talk to.
Sounds like you've had better luck.

My approach was to look at a way to partner with the RMEF with their land
and habitat conservation programs on a national level rather than focusing
on any particular state.  Hopefully this would encourage broad based excelr
employee support and not foster any state biased partisanship.

Subject: Materials for MC Working Group Meeting 12/13/00


Markets Committee Members:  A meeting of the Working Group of the Markets
Committee has been scheduled for Wednesday, December 13, 2000 from 9:00 a.m.
to 3:00 p.m. at the Holiday Inn in Holyoke, MA.  The meeting's agenda
consists of two items, both of which involve MR 17: (1) Transmission
Congestion Compensation and (2) Structural Screen for OP-4 (bid cap) type of
conditions.

Attached is a file containing two exhibits that provide congestion
information that, hopefully, will aid in the group's discussion on the first
item.  With respect to the second item, we will forward to you any materials
we receive.  If you can not make the meeting in person we have arranged for
a conference call.  The dial-in number is as follows:

Telephone Number:  (212) 293-3100
Passcode:  7837367

Thank you.

Don.

Also, attached is the directions to the ISO which show where the Holyoke
Holiday Inn is located.  As you get off 91 North you will see it on your
left just past the gas station at the corner of Whiting Farms Road and Lower
Holyoke Road.  To your right is Holyoke Mall.  If you should have any
questions, please give Susan Dumond a call at (413) 535-4097.

Subject: RE: Draft, Flagstaff Spring meeting


Meeting Planning Team,
This like it is on target at this point.  You should probably circulate the
draft to Pribble, after you are comfortable with it, to get his preliminary
buy-in.  Now, I do have a few questions.  Is someone talking with the
Little America Hotel in Flagstaff and blocking out enough rooms for our
meeting?  When can we get some preliminary dates (How about the week of
April 22, 2002?)???   If that week is not good, then go to the second week
in May as I will have serious conflicts with the first week of May.  Also,
who will be in charge of planning the evening dinners?  I would like to
talk with that person as I have a couple of ""fun"" ideas to offer about
where we might go for dinner.  Thanks to both the North Safety Team and the
SW Environmental Team for taking a lead role in this.  John

Subject: NYISO Newsflash: External load a good deal



All,
?
You may already be  aware of this, but NYISO staff just revealed in a meeting 
that significant  opportunities exist to purchase in real time from the NYISO 
LBMP market at the  PJM proxy bus (i.e., as an external load), due to the 
impact of ECA 1006B.?  When the tie is import constrained in BME, prices 
there since the 1006 ECAs were  implemented have been as low as -$1000.? In 
this case the BME price would  be used for settlement, and you would be paid 
$1000/MWh to export power there  (as your export would offset inbound 
congestion).
?
As more people begin  to take advantage of this, the BME prices can be 
expected to be less  negative.
?
Caution!? If  you schedule a transaction DA, but it fails the DA checkout, 
when there is  congestion on the ties in BME, you will have to settle the 
difference at the BME  price, and could get hammered.
?
NYISO will probably  issue a bulletin about this later today.
?

If not, I would recommend that you write the permit with all the below

Subject: Sulfur Content Test Method



Larry,

I am going on vacation for two weeks - my last day will be Oct. 31,
which is a little before the end of the comment period.  I am doing
everything I can to make sure the permits are ready to issue when the
comment period ends.  You have asked about using a sulfur analyzer.
Since that is not typical practice for facilities subject to NSPS GG, I
would have to research that.  Frankly, if you want your permits ASAP,
there really isn't time for that.  Does one of the test methods in
Appendix D of Part 75, which I've pasted below, work for you?  (I know
some don't.)  Please advise so we can keep the process moving.  Thanks.

2.3.3.1.2      Use one of the following methods when using manual
sampling (as applicable to the type of gas combusted) to determine the
sulfur
content of the fuel: ASTM D1072-90, ""Standard Test Method for Total
Sulfur in Fuel Gases"", ASTM D4468-85 (Reapproved 1989) ""Standard
Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and
Radiometric Colorimetry,"" ASTM D5504-94 ""Standard Test Method for
Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by
Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence,"" or ASTM D3246-81
(Reapproved 1987) ""Standard Test Method for Sulfur in Petroleum Gas By
Oxidative Microcoulometry"" (incorporated by reference under
o  75.6).

Alert Posted: 4:25 PM October 7, 2000: Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pool :
South GA. VAldosta
Therefore, for Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., Valdosta primary pool
 will be under a Demand Mismatch Order.
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
This demand mismatch order carries a potential incentive charge of $30.00/dth 
for under deliveries to AGLC's system.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.
If you have any questions regarding the demand mismatch order, please call 
Brad Freeman at 404-584-4993, or Gas Operations at 404-584-4477.

43314,campbell-l/all_documents/1.,<29904087.1075849737366.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Hi Larry,

Thanks for completing the diamond information request form at 
http://www.DSOURCEVA.com

I did a preliminary search and found the following diamonds for you to 
consider.  There were many extremely nice diamonds at prices substantially 
below your budget so I have include a longer recommendation list than usual.  
This selection should help you determine what is the best value for you.

We filter out the 80 to 90% of diamonds that are cut poorly and only present 
to our customers diamonds that have great cut because we know that cut is the 
primary factor in a diamond's beauty, especially sparkle and fire.

With a round diamond, millimeter measurements are more important than the 
actual carat weight with regard to appearance. More carat weight does not 
necessarily mean more size.  For example, diamonds with depth percentages 
less than 60% will generally have a larger diameter, for the same carat 
weight, than those with depth percentages greater than 60% even though both 
diamonds could be ideal cut.  While we search for diamonds in the top cut 
classes, the preferred combination of depth and table percentages is a matter 
of personal taste and choice.  The three measurement numbers are the longest 
diameter, shortest diameter, and depth in millimeters.  The three letter 
codes after the measurement numbers are the Polish, Symmetry and Fluorescence 
ratings.

Prices in parenthesis are cash discount prices for wire transfers that are 3% 
reduction from credit card prices.  We need to check certification to assess 
specifications marked with ? below.

I've given you a little variety to consider because you need to decide on 
what your priorities are for the right diamond for you.

Which of these diamonds would you like us to order in for inspection?  If 
none of these is what you are looking for, what is it that you would like to 
see different?  The more feedback you can give us, the more effective we can 
be at finding the diamond of your dreams.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

These diamonds were available as of Monday and we have copies of the 
certifications that we can share with you via email at your request.  High 
quality, well cut diamonds like these do not stay on the market long.  If you 
are interested in one of these diamonds, please let us know quickly so we can 
request the wholesaler put it on hold for us.

If you are looking for a really spectacular mounting, check out our favorite 
manufacturer's online catalog at http://www.18karati.com where you can click 
on Catalog then click on Wedding Rings to see pictures of some of the best 
craftsmanship in the industry.  This is a manufacturer's web site so there 
are no prices listed.  If you see something you like, give us the item 
numbers and we will get price quotes that are a fraction of regular retail 
prices.  Our customers have been thrilled with the quality and beauty of 
these mountings so we can highly recommend them to you.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!",Non Abusive

Bret--the work on the old Texaco pit is finished and I am told that neither
Texaco , nor the NMOCD found evidence of migration to the Northern
compressor site. Once you have had a chance to talk to your clients,  and
the excelr consultants who witnessed the work, give me a call and lets
discuss the next step.  I am not sure the settlement agreements we drafted
are still relevant.

As you can see , I am now in our Houston office. You can now contact me at
the numbers shown below. The email address is unchanged. I will be in the
office through Thursday, and out of town the following week.

Let me know when you are ready to discuss this.

43326,campbell-l/all_documents/101.,<7547547.1075851879862.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"A presentation was given to the Transwestern Marketing Group in Houston over 
the PCB issues affecting sales of natural gas into western markets.  The 
history and future potential impacts of market stratgies were also discussed.

A training session on the Dehy MACT was attended in Santa Fe which was 
sponsored by the state of New Mexico, apprising companies of forth coming 
requirements under Title III.  A request will be sent out ot the field for 
each location which has dehydration to complete a extended gas analysis and 
rich lean glycol samples.  Notification to the staes and EPA is due by June 
17, 2000.

A conference call was attended to discuss the C/S 8 turbine project and its 
fate.  Based upon submitted discussions it was decided to dispose of the 
turbine, compressor and auxillary box as a PCB contaminated waste and move 
the contaminated articles to a PCB landfill.

The quarterly Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee mtg was held via 
conference call.  Invoices and charges were discussed which So
cal had charged to their management and handling of PCB's on their system.  
At 86%, Transwestern's responsibility was $71,208.61.

Clearances were received from the F&W and SHPO for the additional areas for 
the powerline transmission corridor of the Gallup C/S which is in progress.

A custom fuel monitoring request wqas submitted to Region VI EPA for the 
Transwestern Lone Star Valero C/S.

Installation and testing has been initiated on the precombustion chambers for 
the Superiors at the Atoka No. 3 C/S.   While fabrication is in progress for 
the correct chamber,  temporary Waukesha chambers were installed.  Even 
though the chambers were not of the correct size and configuration, a 12.5% 
fuel savings was achieved and emissions were reduced by over 56%.  The 
correct chambers will be available and installed sometime next week.    ",Non Abusive

Subject: Price Corrections for the 16 November 2000 Day-Ahead Market



PSEG shares the concerns that have been raised on this tie list concerning
the price correction to the November 16 DAM market.  In addition to clearly
explaining exactly what happened, we request the ISO address the following
issues at the November 30 BIC meeting:

1.  How, if this was an error, did it get so far into the SCUC process -
especially given the impact it had on system prices?
2.  Explaining exactly what authority the ISO is acting under in eliminating
the ""problem"" bid.
3.  Defining the time frame of all actions taken involving this transaction
(i.e., will you provide participants with a time-line from beginning to end
with these transactions)
4.  Outlining the security issues that will be taken to insure the data
integrity and time stamps associated with all levels of this transaction,
including MIS data and correspondence between the participant and the ISO.
5.  Assuring the market participants that the financial implications and
credit restrictions on the bidding entity were NOT the driving force behind
changing prices (the impact of this could bankrupt certain market
participants - we want to know that this is not a concern the ISO is
addressing).
6.  In Jim's notification he states:  ""The NYISO experienced software
anomalies with respect to the submission of these transactions that may have
contributed to the difficulties experienced in confirming the initial bids.""
The word ""may"" in this statement infers there may be a doubt that there was
a direct connection between the software problem and the bids.   Will you be
committing in this meeting to exactly what caused the problem?

43337,campbell-l/all_documents/102.,<15871103.1075851879886.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"We received preliminary sample results yesterday. Sample #1 (TPH = 97 mg/kg) 
and Sample #2 (TPH = 121 mg/kg) were collected from the east wall of the 
excavation about 2 feet outside the NNG facility fence and about 4 feet below 
ground surface. Sample #3 (TPH = 22400 mg/kg) was collected from the east 
wall of the excavation about 8 feet outside the NNG facility fence and about 
8-10 feet below ground surface. There was little visual evidence that this 
soil sample was affected, but apparently it is. 

In my discussions with Texaco's consultant, I inquired about their sample 
analysis plan. He indicated that they were submitting soil samples for TPH 
analysis by method 8015mod (GRO & DRO). I was concerned about comparing 
results from the 8015mod analysis to our older data generated by method 
418.1. In light of this I submitted our samples for analysis by method 418.1. 
The 8015mod method is a more compound specific analysis than the 418.1 method 
and often the more appropriate method to use. However, in this case it may 
not be the most appropriate method. The 8015mod method is a GC method used to 
measure the mass of hydrocarbon compounds that will elute within specific 
time windows. The first time window is set up to measure the mass of gasoline 
range organics (GRO). The second time window is set up to measure the mass of 
diesel range organics (DRO). Any hydrocarbon compounds that elute after the 
DRO time window are not measured. This would not be an issue if the soil was 
contaminated with a light condensate, but Texaco's oil pit was reportedly 
used to accumulate liquids not suitable for feed stock to the plant. I think 
we can assume this meant heavy hydrocarbons. The 418.1 method is a less 
sophisticated method that measures petroleum hydrocarbon compounds over a 
wider range of carbon number, that is, it will measure the presence of 
heavier hydrocarbons that would not be measured using method 8015mod. In 
light of this, the 418.1 method is likely the more appropriate method for 
assessing soil affected by the Texaco oil pit, particularly when results are 
compared to older data generated using method 418.1.

I have requested our lab to confirm the results for Sample #3 using method 
418.1. In addition, I have asked that they run the sample using method 
8015mod (GRO & DRO) so that we can compare the two results. We should have 
these results later next week. I would like to get this additional 
information and discuss it among ourselves before we respond to Texaco. Right 
now I am inclined to say that the Texaco oil pit is neither implicated or 
cleared as the culprit of contamination found in NNG's monitor well MW-3.

Dear Market Participants

Many Market Participants recognized the mismatch in prices which were posted 
on
the NYISO website versus those which were used for billing in the settlement
statements.

The NYISO has identified the various differences and has modified software
necessary to update and / or correct the prices associated with the categories
listed below;

Upon completion of all the Historical LBMP updates noted below, the NYISO will
recompute and post new real time weighted files.  Information on what 
intervals
have been changed, as a result of a specific issue noted below, will be
provided.

Issue #1:  Prices and Postings During Reserve Pickup Intervals:
During instances where the dispatch interval is in response to a  Reserve 
Pickup
request, the price which will be used to bill a Reserve Pickup (RPU)  period 
is
the price associated with the most recent normal SCD execution interval
preceding the reserve pickup interval. There were limited instances during the
first 11 months of operation where an LBMP was incorrectly calculated and 
posted
for the reserve pickup intervals.

Solution Issue #1:  For the period 11/99 until the present, all RPU intervals
that were inadvertently posted with price calculations based on the reserve
pickup intervals will be replaced with the price from the dispatch cycle
immediately preceding the reserve pickup.  Any modifications made which result
in changes to the billing data will be corrected through the re-bill and 
true-up
process in future months.


Issue #2:  Posted Price Discrepancies Between Proxy Bus and Load Bus Prices:
During the process of correcting and reposting prices, the Generator or proxy
bus prices were updated, but not the Zonal or load prices.

Solution Issue #2: ALL proxy gen prices which are different from their
corresponding zonal prices, will be copied into the zonal bus prices to
overwrite any possible discrepancies between these two files, as these should 
be
identical. NOTE: The Billing & Accounting System (BAS) was coded to use the
generator proxy bus price.  Therefore the BAS calculations have been 
consistent
with the generator proxy price and should not affect any bills.


Issue #3:  Missing SCD Intervals In Pass of Data Between SCD and PTS- Due to
Loss of Communications:
At times there periods exist when communication links between operating 
systems,
namely SCD and Performance Tracking (PTS) in this case, have failed and have 
to
be manually reactivated.  During these sub-system failure periods, SCD 
intervals
are being saved and when communications are restored or through the price
correction process the SCD intervals are restored.  During these failure 
periods
the SCD Start/Stop signals are not being transferred to the PTS. Six-second
actual data continues to be received by PTS during these failure periods.  PTS
develops an average actual value over the SCD interval periods. During the
failure periods the PTS observations do not match the number of SCD interval
observations. The BAS is coded to ignore any intervals where there is not a
match between the price file and the metered MW files. For example, if SCD had
intervals for :05, :10 and :15 and the PTS integrated actuals covered the 
period
:05 - :15 then the BAS would calculate the billing based on the consistent 
sets
of data, The interval then becomes a 10 minute interval.

Solution Issue #3 The system will be programmed such that it will recognize 
when
an interval is missing in PTS and the PTS interval will be generated by
splitting the large interval,  with the assumption that the energy was 
delivered
uniformly over the entire interval.   Retroactive to Nov'99, the missing
intervals will be created.  Through the monthly rebill and true-up process,
these intervals will be used and billing results may change as a result.

Issue #4:  Dispatch Interval Type ""R""
When SCD is in a reserve pickup, and the pick-up is unsuccessful after 10
minutes, an extra PTS interval is generated for performance tracking of units.
This interval is not an actual interval where basepoints are calculated and 
sent
to generators.  At the time the PTS intervals are sent to the MIS, an LBMP
interval is also sent.    These intervals were posted on the OASIS and then
ignored in BAS.

Solution Issue #4 Retroactively to Nov'99, all LBMP intervals generated as 
part
of the reserve pickup performance tracking process will be deleted.  In the
future, the intervals will not be sent to MIS for posting.

Issue #5:  Consistent Updated Price Postings
Prior to January 2000, intervals updated as part of price corrections were
posted to a different spot on the OASIS in a different format,  thus making it
difficult for market participants to locate the correct data.

Solution Issue #5 Retroactively to Nov'99, an update of the current LBMP 
posting
files will be accomplished to include the price corrections not originally
posted.


The intent of the NYISO is to have all corrections for retroactive price 
posting
discrepancies, and software enhancements completed by the end of Nov 2000.

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Chuck

I have a question or two with regard to the following ""Operational
Announcements"" (Below). These are a few examples of many that are requests
for generation being requested out-of-merit by the NYISO for NYISO security.

In my limited understanding of the way SCD works I had thought that the only
reason the ISO or a Transmission Owner would request generation out-of-merit
is to resolve for a constraint or system condition that SCD could not (set
me straight if I am off-base).
Requesting generation out-of-merit to resolve for system security is an
effective method of quickly resolving for an out-of-scope SCD system problem
and by definition will not set clearing price.

1. What are the rules and procedures in place to request generation
out-of-merit both for local (Transmission Owner) and ISO request.
2. What other control actions have to be exhausted prior to initiating a
request for generation to be called on out-of-merit.
3. Are the generation bids available to the requestor(s) prior to making the
request. (Is economics a consideration?)
4. When load is available to be dispatched, will it be considered as a
control action instead of generation?
5. Is generation called on out-of-merit to resolve for DNI constraints.
6. In particular for Gilboa it was my understanding that prior to requesting
additional generation from Gilboa that an emergency was to take place. Is
there another agreement in place between the NYISO and NYPA. Below is an
excerpt from the ICAP manual.

4.4.2 Energy Limited Resources

Energy Limited Resources that are ICAP suppliers must be able to provide the
Energy equivalent of their claimed ICAP for four (4) hours each day. Energy
Limited Resources must bid or schedule in the Day-Ahead Market for
twenty-four (24) hours each day in such a way as to enable the NYISO to
schedule them for the period in which they are capable of providing the
energy.
An Energy Limited Resource must also provide the NYISO with information
concerning the hours during which it will be recharging or replacing
depleted
resources. Once the resource has provided four hours of Energy equivalent
ICAP, the NYISO will not call on an Energy Limited Resource during its
recharge
hours, except in the case of an emergency.

As an aside to this did NYPA declare the hours that it was not running on
May 8, 9 as recharge hours and conversely the hours that it was dispatched
by the NYISO. Was an emergency declared (as defined by NPCC).


I am seeking to get further detail in the operational announcements for both
local and NYISO requests for generation out-of-merit. If there are further
enhancements required for SCD in order to reduce the number of requests for
generation out-of-merit; what are they and when will they be implemented?

With all that has been going through about the price change for the

accepted as the price cleared at less than -900.00.  The power was then
scheduled with NYISO and subsequently scheduled with PJM, creating
financial obligations on both ends.  What would happen to the economics
of this schedule in this case?

Is evening load pick up a security issue or an economic issue?
Loading a Gilboa to peak shave is outside of the market rules. There are
other bids that should have been accepted prior to this control action.

27-Nov-2000 15:45:59 ISO REQUESTS GILBOA___4 OUT OF MERIT FOR ISO SECURITY.
EVENING LOAD PICK UP AT 16:00 11/27/00

If the NYISO is under generated due to load pick up why are GTs not
dispatched instead of loading generation out-of-merit.
If the NYISO is loading Gilboa to satisfy 10 min spinning reserve why are
not 10 min non-spin generators or 30 minute non-spin generators dispatched
prior to dispatching generation out-of-merit.
Both 10 minute and 30 minute non-spin generators if generated could be
generated displacing 10 spinning reserve negating the need to dispatch
Gilboa out-of-merit.
As always due to limited info available conclusions are drawn based on info
available. If more info is available please post it.

Thanks

issue with PG&E.  Transwestern met with PG&E this last Wednesday with an 
agenda that included some sharing of sampling results collected downstream of 
their first C/S (Topock) and on out west toward their main distribution 
areas.  With respect to the most recent sampling data, Low PCB concentrations 
(N.D. to 38 ppm) have been detected in drips and interconnects between Topock 
and Hinckley C/S.  The good news is that PCB's have not been detected 
downstream of Hinckley which is approx. 160 miles from the Topock C/S.  PG&E 
has also initiated construction and installation of some drips and small 
separators at locations where their gas feeds into other lines or directly 
into customers.  the proposed installation date for the large mainline filter 
separators is still on target for 6/1/00.

Now for the bad news.  At the conclusion of the meeting, PG&E has stated that 
they want their Topock C/S decontaminated.  This includes all piping and 
equipment.  I stated to them the impractabibility and zero success rate of 
removing all the PCB's from their system and that there would be no 
quarantees that the deconning would be successful.   The contract PCB 
deconning companies only have permits which would guarantee cleanup to 10 
ug.  They were told that it would be impossible to clean everything and that 
in all probability the PCB concentrations would be showing up as the gas 
continues to move through the system.  Additionally, the better remediation 
approach would be to continue to remove PCB containing liquids at strategic 
locations.  Even with this, they were pretty insistent that their management 
wanted the facility cleaned.  Preliminary $$ estimates range to approx. 3-5 
million.

I think that this is only the ""tip of the iceberg"".  If they are successful 
with this action, the pipeline system will be next.  Their pipeline is not 
piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe, valves etc. 

Ill keep you informed on this,,,,,,,",Non Abusive

Dear Market Participants,

- At about 6:30PM (1830) on November 22, 2000 the Production
Mainframe was restarted at the request of the Shift Supervisor
(for time not updating on screens).

- The Mainframe-Spider Data Exchange (DEX) did not initialize
correctly at that time causing a failure to send any 5-min data
(MWs and LBMPs)  to the MIS.

- The problem was finally corrected at approximately 7:15PM (1914)
which re-established the DEX.

- We have been able to reconstruct the LBMPs that were calculated
during this problem period, as well as the PTS data.

- This data was posted and the final billing for Nov will include this data.

Dear Market Participants,

With regard to the change shown below:
FERC ruled that the implementation of Locational Reserve Pricing must be
delayed for a period of 5 months.
The literal interpretation of that would indicate a April 8th deployment.
I can't say for sure that we have committed to that date specifically, but I 
can
say it won't take place before then.
The specifications of the eventual change may look quite different in 5 months
time.

All,

I didn't catch the impact of this when I first saw it last week, but NYISO
is making a change that should cause real time prices to increase (relative
to historical prices) in cases where bid load is less than real time actual
load.  They will be committing GTs in the reliability pass of SCUC at an
incremental cost of zero (instead of committing a steam unit), which
increases the likelihood that GTs will run in real time under these
conditions, increasing real time prices.  The change goes into effect today
or tomorrow.  See below.

Scheduled for 11/29/00 & 11/30/00
Change type - Enhancement
Description:
Billing System changes will be deployed to implement 10 minute,
non-synchronous and 10 minute, spinning lost opportunity payments.

Also, billing software deployment to allow PURPA Class 2 units to
participate in the LBMP market and not have their transactions
adjusted after the fact.

MIS change will enable web posting (via Operational Announcement)
in the event of a reserve pick-up.

SCUC and BME software modifications will include the following:
- SCUC modeling of Gas Turbines as zero cost capacity resources in
  the Forecast Load Commitment Passes of SCUC.
- SCUC and BME pro-rata scheduling of external transactions with
  equal bids in the event multiple transactions are marginal.
- SCUC and BME non-distributed scheduling of reserve suppliers in
  the event multiple suppliers are marginal.

Gentlemen:

We should be concluding discssions today with regard to the contracting and
scope of work issues for our project with Penn State.  A number of data
needs have been identified.  Please review available information for the
following:

Larry - Information related to arsenic - analytical/source informaition.
Last three months of analytical on liquids from the pipeline.  We probably
ought to pull together the liquids information from late 1998 to present.
Sampling and lab protocols.  Any Liquids composition analysis.

Earl - Station Three and Four Schematics, Alignment sheets (focus on Section
4 so we do not overwhelm the Professor's team). Gas composition analysis
(primarily Needles).

Eric - please forward this to Ben Asante, Terry Gallassini, Frank Osborne
and cc: Mike Nelson and Rich Jolly.  Remind me to contact Neta on billing
information/format to send to the Professor's team .

Ben and Terry -  what modeling information/software can we share with Penn
State??

Frank - Mike left you a message about contacting the Professor's team on the
method by which we can transfer materials electronically rather than killing
an entire forest for the paper copies.  This is an enginerring facility so
they likely have similar capablities to us.

We will follow up when we return.

Statement of the Department of Public Service Staff to the BIC
Regarding Shortening the ICAP Obligation Procurement Period from Six
Months to One Month


The ICAP Working Group has proposed Phase II tariff language that
implements the BIC/MC decisions to implement a monthly ICAP obligation
procurement period (OPP) instead of the current six-month OPP.  It is our
understanding that this proposal is largely supported by incumbent load
serving entities who are currently required to purchase their ICAP six
month's in advance even though they expect to lose load to new entrants
during that period.  The LSE's are concerned that they may lose money
trying to sell unneeded ICAP back into the market.  Staff of the New York
State Department of Public Service (Staff) understands those concerns.

A report by the Brattle Group suggests that the existence of price caps in
New York could lead to capacity migration from New York under a one-month
OPP scenario.  Brattle suggests that under such a system certain
""optimistic"" suppliers might choose not to offer to sell their ICAP to NY
if they think they could do better by selling energy into external markets
where they could earn high revenues in high demand month.   If that
happens, even to a limited extent, we believe it will likely result in
increased purchase costs for ICAP purchased both on a bilateral basis and
through the ISO auctions, and could also push up energy prices.

In a subsequent study by KEMA it is suggested that in order to avoid
capacity migration ICAP deficiency charges should be increased as much as
six-fold.  The obvious result would be that all LSE's would be exposed to
significantly higher deficiency charges under a
one-month OPP.  Staff does not view this as an acceptable alternative to
retaining a six-month OPP even with its potential that LSEs may incur a
loss as a result of purchasing ICAP for load they expect to lose.

As of November 29, 2000, the ISO has been unable to estimate the level of
deficiency penalties that would be required to avoid capacity migration
under a one-month OPP.  As a result, the New York State Department of
Public Service has been unable to verify whether the current levels need
to be increased, decreased or left as they are.  Because of concerns about
capacity migration, and because there is very little convincing argument
about the costs/benefits that would result from moving to a one-month ICAP
OPP that cannot at least partially be obtained from the six month OPP with
monthly deficiency auctions, Staff is opposed to such a change at this
time.   Until the ISO and market participants work out how to ensure that
energy and ICAP markets will remain workably competitive even during peak
periods, we believe it is prudent to move cautiously with regard to
shortening the OPP.

43376,campbell-l/all_documents/1059.,<4315463.1075857852365.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"The ISO (K Robb) circulated the ISO's position on the Def Penalties this
PM. It is attached.

As it stands, what the ISO wants now (or previously wanted) is an issue to
be decided by the BIC. What is now proposed - empowering the ISO to change
the deficiency rates if an adjacent ISO modifies (presumably upward) their
caps - has one large problem: if such an action were taken in the midst of
a Capability Period it would cause all sorts of issues with participant
positions.

Having said that I offer the following:

The FERC staff report strongly indicated that caps would have to exist (if
at all) on a regional basis and at similar levels.

In order to de-list and be free to sell out, a generator must make that
decision for the following month by the 10th of the current month. That is
trading a sure ICAP revenue stream for the increased opportunity to sell
energy at higher prices - even if some disaster befell one of out
neighbors, the amount that can move is limited by the transmission
capability.

What is the likelihood that any of the 3 NE ISOs will be uncapped next
Summer?

The transmission system limits how much energy can flow regardless of price
considerations. NY-NE about 1500Mw and NY-PJM about 2000 Mw (pending return
of the PARs).

BME, if faced with a reserve shortage (or inability to meet load), will
curtail exports to solve that problem.

than 119 mscf  to the atmosphere (in a 24 hour period), to be reported to the 
Regional Offices of the TNRCC.  These releases include but may not be limited 
to the following:  ESD's, startups, shutdowns, pipeline ruptures and 
maintenance activities.  Should any of the above activities release natural 
gas in excess of 119 mscf, a written notification should be faxed to the 
Regional Office of the TNRCC  within the following timeframes:

 Unanticipated Upsets- within 24 hours after the discovery of the upset. 

 Maintenance, Startup or Shutdowns- 10 day prior to the expected exceedance.

This reminder is being sent to all ET&S teams within Texas because in the 
last two Northern Natural Gas compressor station inspections conducted by the 
TNRCC,  they specifically requested backup data and reporting documentation 
of the natural gas releases to the atmosphere which were greater than 119 
mscf.  The agency's  inquiry specifically addressed knowledge of compressor 
station venting for ESD, start ups and shutdowns.

It should also be mentioned that there has been inconsistencies in the 
TNRCC's position regarding this issue.  However, until a position has been 
adopted by excelr's GPG, I am recommending that each facility comply and 
report as appropriate.

The fax numbers for the following Regional offices are as follows:

 Midland (915)  570-4795    Included facilities-  Wt-2, Walton, Keystone, 
Lone Star Valero, Spraberry, Seminole

 Lubbock (806)  796-7107  Included facilities-  P-2, Plainview, Brownfield

> The 'Web Enablement' team has finished work on
> the second release of the portal, and it is now
> accessible. The following information is also
> available on www.texaschoiceprogram.com.
> What is the ERCOT portal?
> The ERCOT portal will consolidate information
> from a variety of sources into a customizable &
> comprehensive view of business activity relative
> to each market participant. Functions available
> via the portal will include viewing status of
> transactions, access to the market operations
> systems, bid submission, and more. Security
> features will determine the data and functions
> available to each market participant.
>
>
> What is the portal release 2 for the ERCOT
> portal?
> The portal release 2 is a pre-release version of
> the portal that will include static web pages
> that have no functional behavior. The purpose of
> this release is to provide exposure to the
> portal user interface look and feel, and not to
> demonstrate specific portal functionality. This
> is not intended to be a final product release.
> The functional component of the portal is
> currently under development, and will not be
> fully tested in a manner that is suitable for
> public release by 10/31. (This includes client
> side validation, file upload, error pages,
> confirmation pages, etc.) Future portal releases
> will have these features enabled.  Unlike the
> earlier proof of concept release, no usability
> tests will be conducted on the release 2 portal
> version. Because the portal will contain static
> view-only user interfaces, there is no back end
> systems integration between the portal and
> Siebel, LODESTAR, etc.
> How can you access the portal release 2 version
> of the portal?
> The address for the portal release 2 version of
> the portal is:
>
> https://portal.texaschoiceprogram.com
>
> To access the portal follow these instructions:
>
> Note: Before you can access the portal, you must
> access and install a digital certificate.
>
> Launch and review the attached document titled,
> 'Accessing the Portal'. It provides you with

Subject: Re: Notice of Pending Changes (effective 12/18/2000) to MAPP's Loss 
Repayment Procedure  

I called MAPP to get a better understanding of the pending Dec. 18th LRP 
changes as explained in detail below.
Currently the ""source"" generator is responsible for the Losses.  The new 
policy states that the Scheduling customer is now responsible for Losses.  
MAPP is implementing this change as a requirement under their tariff.  
Changes to software and systems has delayed this change from being 
implemented any earlier.
What it means to excelr as a Schedule F customer:
 1)  excelr (or any Schedule F customer) is responsible for  losses based on a 
yet to be published Loss Matrix that MAPP will provide on it web page.  The 
loss  calculation matrix and methodolgy will not change, just the party 
responsible for providing the losses.  When scheduling energy, excelr must  
either schedule physical losses or buy losses from a designated Source 
Scheduling participant (SSP).  The SSP will then be responsible for 
disbursing the losses to each designated CA a week later.
The identity of the SSP will be the Source of power (if a MAPP member), or 
the POR on your Schedule F (If Source is outside MAPP).

Subject: Notice of Pending Changes (effective 12/18/2000) to MAPP's Loss 
Repayment Procedure


Notice of new MAPP Loss Repayment Policies and Procedures

At the direction of the Regional Transmission Committee of MAPP, new Loss
Repayment Policies and Procedures will be implemented on December 18, 2000.
These changes make the transmission customer, as identified on the OASIS
reservation, responsible for paying energy losses on MAPP Schedule F
transmission service.  Previously, the MAPP Source entity has been
responsible for paying these losses.  These changes do not modify the
application of MAPP's Loss Repayment Procedure (LRP) to MAPP Member Open
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) customers.  Changes to the administration
of Schedule F loss repayment include:
o The Schedule F transmission customer will now be responsible for the LRP
losses on their energy schedules.
o Payment of third party impacts due to ""through flowing"" Schedule F
transactions (where the Source and Sink are both outside MAPP) will be
included in the LRP.
o To facilitate the payment of third party losses, the Customer will make
arrangements with the Source Scheduling Participant (SSP), as defined on the
transmission reservation, to pay for energy transaction losses at the onset
of a schedule.
o The SSP will bank the losses for repayment of third party losses, one week
later, to the day. The repayment is done, as it is today, according to a
schedule sent out by the MAPP Center.
For additional information please see the business practices section of
MAPP's Schedule F OASIS:
http://mapp.oasis.mapp.org/documents/MAPP/practices.html

Questions may be e-mailed to Tom White at the MAPP Center:
ts.white@mapp.org

Answers to frequently asked questions will be posted at the URL given above.

some statements which are incorrect.  Louie and I are planning to attend this

above referenced parties concerning the issue of PCB's which had migrated 
into the PG&E system.  Southwest Gas is a customer of PG&E's and recieves 
natural gas from PG&E for delivery to its customers,   PG&E has prepared a 
media statement which it is going to be sent out to those parties which 
receive gas from interconnects testing positive for PCBs.  As of today, only 
the customer base around Needles, California will see the PG&E statement.  

The two issues of note.  First, Transwestern was able to make some minor 
changes to the media statement to more clearly show in the statement that 
this release of PCBs was an isolated incident and that all parties are 
diligently incorporating measures to contain and manage this release.  
A copy of the revised media statement is available upon request  from Louie 
or myself. 

Second,   PG&E and Southwest Gas have jointly agreed to conduct immediate 
sampling activities at downstream interconnect locations on the Southwest Gas 
system to determine if the PCB's have spread into parts of their system.  
Results of this sampling will be presented in a meeting tentatively scheduled 
in a couple of weeks.  Transwestern will probably atttend this meeting.

what they are scheduled.  The change was not factored in the June
re-bill.

>
> HEALTH: PG&E is at work to clean up situation.  By TERI FIGUEROA Staff
> Writer
>
> BARSTOW -- Pacific Gas and Electric Co. is working to eliminate a
> potential cancer-causing agent found in High Desert gas lines.
>
> Because the amount of the chemical compound polychlorinated biphenyls, or
> PCBs, is in trace amounts, officials from the Environmental Protection
> Agency say no clean-up is required.
>
> When the PCBs were found in small quantities in the High Desert area in
> February, the company immediately began to rectify the problem, Jon
> Tremayne, news director for PG&E, said.
>
> ""We've been doing very aggressive testing,"" Tremayne said. ""As we identify
> (affected areas), we will continue to propose and install filter
> separators.""
>
> The filter separators catch the PCBs so the company can collect the
> chemical for disposal.
>
> Randy Wittorp, spokesperson for the California EPA office, said because
> the chemical is contained within the gas lines, it's unlikely there has
> been human exposure.
>
> ""What we are talking about here is very low levels, well below EPA
> levels,"" Tremayne said.
>
> PCB levels detected in the area range from 2 to 22 parts per million,
> Tremayne said, with the majority of PCBs in the range of six to 10 parts
> per million.
>
> EPA regulations state the danger levels for PCBs are anything above 50
> parts per million, an EPA official said.
>
> ""PCBs are authorized for use at concentrations of less than 50 PPMs,"" said
> Max Weintraub, PCB coordinator for the EPA in the California region. ""The
> federal law really starts at 50 PPM. There's no requirement that they
> clean it up.""
>
> Tremayne said an EPA study shows PCBs have been known to cause cancer in
> laboratory rats. Information from the EPA shows exposure to the chemical
> has been associated with cancer, neurological and reproductive effects.
>
> ""You're not going to breath it in, but you will get exposed to it through
> skin contact and consumption,"" Weintraub said.
>
> The material was detected as far away as 20 miles west of Hinkley and down
> into Rabbit Springs meter station. The Helendale regulation station has so
> far shown no detectable levels of PCBs, he said.
>
> PG&E delivers gas to Southwest Gas Co., who in turn serves 100,000
> customers in the High Desert, Southwest Gas spokesman Roger Buehrer said.
>
>
> Buehrer said his company has been testing for PCBs for about six weeks,
> and so far have not detected the chemical in their pipe lines.
>
> ""We don't think there is anything to worry about because the levels are so
> low,"" Buehrer said.
>
> Buehrer said the company will continue PCB testing through next week.
>
> The PCBs traveling through the gas lines are in small amounts, said Robert
> Doss, site remediation principal in the environmental services division of
> PG&E.
>
> ""We are not finding them at customer meters,"" Doss said. ""The potential
> for them to get to customers is very slim. This was a surprise to us.
> We've had decades of clean tests.""
>
> Tremayne said the source of the PCB contamination is coming from
> Transwestern Pipeline Co. and said the two companies are working closely
> to eliminate the chemical.
>
> ""It's not a finger-pointing game,"" he said. ""Everybody is working together
> to get this thing resolved.""
>
> The company has been working to eliminate the problem, said Dave Schafer,
> spokesman for Transwestern Pipeline.
>
> ""Our commitment is to get it down to levels that aren't even trace
> amounts,"" Schafer said.
>
> Tremayne said PG&E officials notified the California Public Utilities
> Commission of the PCB detection on Tuesday, and the state attorney
> general's office last week. PG&E has also notified officials from the
> Southwest Gas Co., the local gas utility supplier who takes the feed from
> the PG&E gas line and delivers it to customers.

Dear Santa: 

Listen you fat little troll, I've been  helping you out every year, playing 
at 
being the perfect Christmas present,  wearing skimpy bathing suits in frigid 
weather, and drowning in fake tea  from one too many tea parties, and I hate 
to break it to ya Santa, but IT'S  DEFINITELY PAYBACK TIME! There had better 
be some changes around here this  Christmas, or I'm gonna call for a 
nationwide meltdown (and trust me, you  won't wanna be around to smell it). 

So, here's my holiday wish list,  Santa: 

1. A nice, comfy pair of sweat pants and a frumpy, oversized  sweatshirt. I'm 
sick of looking like a hooker. How much smaller are these  bathing suits 
gonna 
get? Do you have any idea what it feels like to have  nylon and Velcro 
crawling up your butt? 

2. Real underwear that can  be pulled on and off. Preferably white. What 
bonehead at Mattel decided to  cheap out and MOLD imitation underwear to my 
skin? (It looks like  cellulite). 

3. A REAL man... maybe GI Joe. Hell, I'd take Tickle-Me Elmo  over that 
wimped-out excuse for a boyfriend Ken. And what's with that  earring anyway? 
If I'm gonna have to suffer with him, at least make him and  me anatomically 
correct. 

4. Arms that actually bend so I can push  the aforementioned Ken-wimp away 
once he is anatomically correct. 

5.  Breast reduction surgery. I don't care whose arm you have to twist, just 
get  it done. 

6. A sports bra. To wear until I get the surgery. 

7. A  new career. Pet doctor and school teacher just don't cut it. How about 
a  
systems analyst? Or better yet, an advertising account executive. 

8.  A new, more '90s persona. Maybe ""PMS Barbie,"" complete with a miniature  
container of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips;  
""Animal Rights Barbie,"" with my very own paint gun, outfitted with a fake  
fur 
coat and handcuffs; or ""Stop Smoking Barbie,"" sporting a removable  Nicotrol 
patch and equipped with several packs of gum. 

9. No more  McDonald's endorsements. The grease is wrecking my vinyl. 

10. Mattel  stock options. It's been 37 years, I think I deserve it. 

OK, Santa,  that's it. Considering my valuable contribution to society, I 
don't think  these requests are out of line. If you disagree, then you can 
find yourself  a new bimbo doll for next Christmas. It's that simple. 

Yours truly,  

Barbie

There are still no answers to the questions (below).

In addition to this I am curious that when the NYISO requests generation for
ISO security it is only Transmission Owner generation that is dispatched,
undoubtedly avoiding merchant generation from being dispatched. I was
wondering where the tariff language is to justify this type of out-of-merit
generation dispatch.

What deficiencies are there in the SCD software that it cannot handle load
pickups?
What is an NYISO SCD reserve pickup, and how does it affect generation from
setting clearing prices?

Why do these questions go unanswered, if there is tariff language to support
this please point me in the right direction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------

I have a question or two with regard to the following ""Operational
Announcements"" (Below). These are a few examples of many that are requests
for generation being requested out-of-merit by the NYISO for NYISO security.

In my limited understanding of the way SCD works I had thought that the only
reason the ISO or a Transmission Owner would request generation out-of-merit
is to resolve for a constraint or system condition that SCD could not (set
me straight if I am off-base).
Requesting generation out-of-merit to resolve for system security is an
effective method of quickly resolving for an out-of-scope SCD system problem
and by definition will not set clearing price.

1. What are the rules and procedures in place to request generation
out-of-merit both for local (Transmission Owner) and ISO request.
2. What other control actions have to be exhausted prior to initiating a
request for generation to be called on out-of-merit.
3. Are the generation bids available to the requestor(s) prior to making the
request. (Is economics a consideration?)
4. When load is available to be dispatched, will it be considered as a
control action instead of generation?
5. Is generation called on out-of-merit to resolve for DNI constraints.
6. In particular for Gilboa it was my understanding that prior to requesting
additional generation from Gilboa that an emergency was to take place. Is
there another agreement in place between the NYISO and NYPA. Below is an
excerpt from the ICAP manual.

4.4.2 Energy Limited Resources

Energy Limited Resources that are ICAP suppliers must be able to provide the
Energy equivalent of their claimed ICAP for four (4) hours each day. Energy
Limited Resources must bid or schedule in the Day-Ahead Market for
twenty-four (24) hours each day in such a way as to enable the NYISO to
schedule them for the period in which they are capable of providing the
energy.
An Energy Limited Resource must also provide the NYISO with information
concerning the hours during which it will be recharging or replacing
depleted
resources. Once the resource has provided four hours of Energy equivalent
ICAP, the NYISO will not call on an Energy Limited Resource during its
recharge
hours, except in the case of an emergency.

TURQUOISE: DECEMBER'S BIRTHSTONE
======================================
The highest ranking among all the opaque stones, turquoise-
the ""Turkish stone""-is highly prized throughout Asia and Africa,
not for its particular hoe of blue (a beautiful robin's egg or
sky blue) but more important for its supposed prophylactic and
therapeutic qualities.  The Arabs consider it a lucky stone and
have great confidence in its benevolent action.  Used in rings,
earrings, necklaces, head ornaments and amulets, it protects the
wearer from poison, reptile bites, eye diseases, and the evil
eye.  It was also believed capable of warning of impending death
by changing color.  Buddhists revere the turquoise because it is
associated with a legend in which a turquoise enabled Buddha to
destroy a monster.  Even today it is considered a symbol of
courage, success, and love.  It has also long been associated
American Indian jewelry and art.

Turquoise is an opaque, light to dark blue or blue green stone.
The finest color is an intense blue, with poorer qualities
tending toward yellowish green.  The famous Persian turquoise,
which can be very intense and pleasing blue, is considered a
very rare and valuable gem.  The United States (Arizona and New
Mexico) is also an important source of fine turquoise, and is
now the major source of turquoise used in jewelry worldwide.

All turquoises are susceptible to aging and may turn greenish
or possibly darker with age.  Also, care must be taken when
wearing, both to avoid contact with soap, grease, or other
materials that might discolor it, and to protect it from abuse,
since turquoise scratches fairly easily.

But exercise caution when buying turquoise.  This is a
frequently simulated gem.  Very fine glass imitations are
produced that are difficult to distinguish from the genuine.
Very fine adulterated stones, and reconstructed stones (from
turquoise powder bonded in plastic) saturate the marketplace, as
does synthetic turquoise.  Make sure you are buying ""genuine,
natural turquoise.""


THE DRESDEN DIAMOND: GREEN GLORY
=================================
The legendary 40.70 carat Dresden green diamond is now on
display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.,
right next to the Hope diamond, until January 10th of next
year--thanks to Ronald Winston, son of the 20th century's
most famous jewel merchant, Harry Winston.

Today the Dresden is to green diamonds what the Hope is to
blues; the most famous gem of its kind.  Estimated to have
lost at least 60 percent of its original 100-carat-plus
weight during cutting, this green giant takes the prize for
size as well as beauty.

Keep in mind that beauty in green diamonds is nothing like
beauty in emerald, jade, or green grossular garnet.  Natural
green diamonds are extremely uncommon occurrences, the result
of irradiation deep within the earth.  And when they are found,
most are pale in color and light in tone, running a hue
spectrum from apple to algae green.  Don't expect these
diamonds to sport stop light or shampoo-green colors.

Nevertheless, the Dresden is a marvel--from a standpoint of
both shading and size.  True, there are green diamonds
without the vibrancy muting gray of the Dresden, but their
far smaller size makes them seem tiny in comparison.  The
Dresden is such a behemoth, at least as far as green diamonds go,
that it sets a standard that will likely never be challenged,
let alone beat.

DO YOU WANT A COLORED GEMSTONE?
==================================
If you have ever wanted a gorgeous colored gemstone but
never knew how to find one, this is your chance to have one
hand picked for you.  In Tucson, Arizona during the first
weekend of February, the country's largest colored gem
trade show brings gem wholesalers from all over the world.
We will be attending the show to hand select the nicest
gems possible for our customers.

There are hundreds of booths of gems including: ruby, emerald,
sapphire, garnet, amethyst, tourmaline, jade, peridot,
spinel, and tanzanite.  If you would like us to add your
name to our shopping list, give us a call and tell us what
you are looking for. Every year we make many customers'
dreams come true as we find terrific values on the highest
quality gemstones in the world.


MEN'S WEDDING BANDS
======================
While there are hundreds, if not thousands, of women's
wedding ring style, there are relatively few common style of
men's rings.  The vast majority of men prefer some type of
comfort fit wedding band.  The term comfort fit comes from
the rounded inside of the ring that helps eliminate the
sharp edges.  Comfort bands come in a variety of finishes
including polished, two tone, hand craved, and milgrain
edges.

For men, the choice seems to focus more on the width of the
band which can range from 2 millimeters wide alll the way
up to 12 millimeters.  Sometimes couples decide to get
matching bands and/or rings but generally each will pick
what they think looks best and is most comfortable to them.

While the current trend is for the use of platinum in
women's wedding rings, men are often surprised how heavy and
expensive a wide man's band is if it is done in platinum.
Yellow and/or white gold is still the preferred metal for men.

Because men tend to wear their rings all the time, the rings
tend to take much more abuse than a women's ring.  A women
will take her ring off to wash her hands, do the dishes,
or fix dinner.  Men leave their rings on to mow the yard,
fix the car, or participate in sports.  This is probably
why you don't see many diamonds in men's wedding bands--
plus the fact that men learn early that most families
can only afford one jewelry lover.

DIAMOND DISTRICT DANGERS
=========================
When we visit with customers, we often hear that they are
contemplating making a trip to the diamond district in New
York to shop for a diamond.  Many people have heard of the
major diamond trading center located on 47th Street in New
York and the myth is that you can get a good deal there.
In reality, the wholesale trading takes place high above
the street in high-security offices hidden from the public.

The vendors on the street are more skilled at taking your
money than anyone you will find in your community.  They
are fast taking, high pressure salesman who specialize in
letting tourist think they are getting a deal.  They often
sell uncertified diamonds and reply on the difficulty of
customers returning to the Diamond District as part of
their sales strategy.

We recommend you never buy from anyone in the Diamond
District in New York unless you are there with a trusted
retailer who takes you to the true dealers who are not
at street level.  Don't become another statistic of one
who got ripped off while trying to get a good deal in
the Diamond District.


ONLY BUY THE CLARITY YOU NEED
=============================
We see more and more customers being told they need
VVS clarity or they will be able to see inclusions in the
their diamond.  Why pay for something you can not see?

For all shapes except emerald, we suggest VS2 or SI1
as your minimum clarity requirement since with an SI1 you
can not see anything with your naked eye.  The truth is
that you can not see the difference between SI1 and all
the higher clarity grades except with a microscope.
Higher clarity than SI1 does not add to beauty of the
diamond, only the rarity and therefore the price.  By
starting with an SI1 clarity you will get a bigger
diamond and have a better selection for getting a great
cut.  The highest clarity grades cost more but are not
necessarily going to appreciate as much as the grades in
most demand such as VS2 and SI1 as explained at
http://www.dsourceva.com/investment.htm on our web site.
The reality is that the first speck of dust that settles
on the diamond has much more visual impact on the beauty of
the diamond than anything in a diamond that is at least a
certified SI1 clarity grade.


50% OFF SALE
========================
You have all seen the billboards and newspaper ads
advertising half off sale at your local jeweler.  It is
not uncommon for stores to mark up items 300-500% so they
can mark them half-price during a sale. It's no great deal
if you are paying 50%, let alone 150% over wholesale.

Don't fall for sales of any kind.  If a dealer can afford
to mark it down, then they marked it up too high at the
start.


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:

FAMOUS DIAMONDS
===============
Name The Star of Sierra Leone
Weight: 968.90 carats rough

Valentine's Day, 1972.   A routine workday at the diamond
mine in Sierra Leone.  Suddenly, a company engineer and a
plant security officer spot something big on the grease table
(grease sticks to diamonds and is used to separate diamonds
from ore).  At first, neither man could believe what they
saw.  There, trapped by the grease, is a huge diamond, the
size of a hen's egg.

When the stone is first offered for sale, none of the sealed
bids reaches the minimum price of more than $2.5 million set
by the government.  Finally, months later, Harry Winston
makes a deal for the Star.  Winston wants a world-class
diamond from his rough.  A 143.20 carat emerald cut is
fashioned, but upon close examination, it reveals inclusions.
Winston changes his mind, deciding that flawlessness is
more important than size.

The big diamond is recut into seven smaller stones, the
largest of which weighs 32.52 carats.  Besides these, the
rough yields 10 other stones ranging from 1.85 to 53.96
carats.  All told, Winston recovers only 238.48 carats, a
staggering loss of almost 75 percent.  But 13 of the 17
finished stones are reportedly flawless.

GEM OF THE DAY
==================================
Keep smiling.  Even when life knocks you flat on your back,
you are still in a good position to look up.

BEWARE OF FRACTIONS
==================================
The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) allows jewelers to round
off diamond weights.  For example, a diamond labeled 3/4 carat
in weight might actually weigh anywhere between .69 and .81
carat.  While these are small weights, the price difference
can be significant.  For instance, if you bought earrings with
G color, SI1 clarity and 3/4 carat in each ear for $5160, you
might have over paid by $1600 if they really weight .69 carats.

Note: Jewelers are also allowed to be off one color and one
clarity grade.  If you don't purchase a certified diamond,
you could find yourself at the short end on weight, color,
clarity and therefore, value.

INTERNET SALES
==================================
Internet shoppers are expected to spend almost $20 billion
online during the 2000 holiday season, nearly double last
year's total of $10.5 billion, according to a recent survey by
the Gartner Interactive Firm.  About half that revenue is
expected to go to U.S. and Canadian e-tailers, with the rest
distributed among firms in Europe and Asia.

Robert Labatt, principal analyst for Gartner's e-Business
Services Unit, credits the increased willingness to do
business online to the e-tailers' extensive efforts in
increasing the customer's comfort level.  Chat rooms and
opportunities to interact with the internet firms are
encouraging more people to try this form of commerce.

DIAMOND GRADING TIPS: FLUORESCENCE
==================================
Fluorescence, if present in a diamond, will be indicated on
a diamond grading report.  It will be graded very faint,
faint, medium, strong, or very strong.  Some reports
indicate the color of fluorescence as blue, yellow, white,
and so on.  A stone with yellow fluorescence should sell
less since it will appear yellower than it really is when
worn in daylight or fluorescent lighting.  The presence of
blue fluorescence will not detract, and in some cases may
be considered a bonus since it may make the stone appear
whiter than it really is in daylight or fluorescent
lighting.  However, if there is very strong fluorescence,
there may be an oily or milky appearance to the diamond.
We recommend avoiding medium or strong fluorescence since
it is just not worth taking the chance of lower value.


BOW TIE
=======
One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning
in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie, or butterfly effect,
a darkened area across the center or widest part of the
stone, depending upon the cut.  The bow tie is commonly
seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any
fancy shape.  Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will
exhibit some minimal bow tie effect.  Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper
proportioning.  In poorly proportioned stones there is a
pronounced bow tie; the more pronounced, the poorer the
proportioning.  The less pronounced the bow tie, the better
the proportioning.  The degree to which the bow tie is
evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make (cut).


DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS
=========================
One of the best ways to be a better shopper for diamonds and
fine jewelry is to read one or more of the great books
listed at the following web page:

Subject: Ground Water Contamination

George,  The Eunice Team has been activitly involved in the well testing for 
ground water contamination for quite    sometime now and know of some of the 
controversy regarding the Eunice Compressor Station.

  Recently Dynegy has undertaking a project to remove a 10"" low pressure sour 
gas pipeline in the     Southwest area of our station outside of our fence 
line.  There are two monitoring wells in this location and    the presence 
of  contamination seems to be increasing in this area.  We took some 
pictures  of this area 
  while Dynegy was in the process of removing their pipe.  There appears to 
be quite abit of contamination    and seemed be generated by the condition of 
the pipe as you will see in the pictures.

  If you have any questions please give us a call.

  Thanks
  Ray Noseff

We are sending this quick note to our diamond customers who are still 
shopping to let you know that the holiday rush has begun.  If you are hoping 
to present your special gift before Christmas, be aware that while we can get 
diamonds in quickly the calendar is getting short for getting a custom 
mounting made.  In another week it will become difficult to get diamonds 
quickly set in mounting.  What normally takes 2-3 days suddenly turns into a 
week long process as the setters are buried with ring sizing, diamond setting 
and other jewelry preparation for the big gift giving days.

If you are planning on presenting your gift after Christmas, you'll have 
plenty of time but the supply of diamonds is as good now as it will be until 
early February.  Unlike cars, TV sets and computers that come down in price 
when the snow falls or following Christmas, we have yet to see diamond prices 
fall.  They tend to keep going up year after year which is good if you own 
them, but a challenge if you are waiting to buy.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST (Mon-Sat) since we are dealing with customers 
and suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always 
want to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs 
and answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

that you forward my original message on the subject to Texaco's attorney 
asking several questions: 1) is Texaco aware of the pipeline removal 
activities; 2) has the release been stopped and how; 3) has the extent of 
impacted soil been determined and does it extend onto NNG's property or down 
to groundwater; and 4) has the NMOCD been notified. We should also indicate 
our concern that other Texaco pipelines crossing near or through NNG's 
facility may also be in poor condition and should be checked, particularly 
the two lines which cross the southwestern corner of the NNG facility near 
the location of monitor well MW-3 (NNG's well which contains PSH). This will 
allow Texaco the opportunity to notify the OCD. 

In a related matter, I think a copy of the letter that I prepared for Larry 
regarding excavation activities should be transmitted to Texaco's attorney 
and the OCD. I suggest sending a copy of this letter to the OCD because Bill 
Olson with the OCD had asked for a copy of any correspondence that was 
generated regarding the excavation activities and because Texaco has already 
indicated that their lab results did not identify the presence of impacted 
soil remaining in the excavation area.

Re:       Extraordinary Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw:

(ECA 20001208B; re-issuance of ECA 20001006B)


Thank  you  for  the  presentation of the Market Monitoring and Performance
Unit  and  the Market Advisor regarding the progress that has been made with 
the
Market Participants in addressing the market design flaw in the Real-Time 
energy
markets  concerning  external  proxy  bus  prices during transmission

periods.  I am pleased that the Business Issues Committee gave unanimous 
support
to  the  NYISO  to  re-issue  ECA  20001006B  until  the Market Participants 
can
consider  and  approve, and the NYISO can implement, a tariff change required 
to
permanently address the Market Design Flaw.

As  stated  in  my Memorandum to you of October 6, 2000, I agreed with your
conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a 

?Market Design
Flaw?  as  defined  in  Attachment  Q  to  the ISO OATT, Temporary 
Extraordinary

Transitional
Abnormalities (the ?TEPs?).  As further stated in that Memorandum, I agreed 
with
your  analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw 
would,
absent  appropriate  action,  remain  different  from what would otherwise 
occur
during periods of efficient competition.

I  have  now  determined,  based  on  consultations  with ISO Staff and the
support  of the Business Issues Committee, that it is appropriate to maintain 
in
effect  the  corrective measures adopted as ECA 20001006B while consultation 
and
cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is 
on-going
to  develop  and  implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance

Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208B

Market Design Flaw Regarding Real-Time External Proxy Bus Prices


Applicability

This  Extraordinary  Correction Action (ECA) shall apply when the following
two conditions are met:

?    Transactions are proposed for an operating hour at an External Proxy Bus;
and
?    The Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) resolves transmission congestion
constraints at the External Proxy Bus for the operating hour, resulting in
transmission congestion charges in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM).

Rationale

When BME solves for proposed transactions at an External Proxy Bus, and the
total  proposed  transactions  exceed  the available transfer capacity, BME 
will
resolve binding constraints at that External Proxy Bus using the decremental 
bid
price  or  the sink price cap bid indicated by the Market Participants 
proposing
the transactions.

In  the  operating hour, the transfer capability and scheduled flows at the
External  Proxy  Bus  are  fixed,  and  SCD  is  not  required  to  resolve  
for
transmission  congestion  costs  associated  with  the  scheduled  
transactions.
Therefore, in operating hours where an External Proxy Bus constraint is 
binding,
Real-Time  prices at the External Proxy Bus will be significantly different 
from
the  HAM  prices,  due  to  the  absence  of transmission congestion costs 
being
reflected  in  the Real-Time price.  Currently, scheduled HAM transactions at 
an
External  Proxy Bus are settled at the Real-Time price at the External Proxy 
Bus
during  the operating hour, and the import transactions receive a Bid 
Production
Cost Guarantee for the deviation in price between the HAM and Real-Time price.

The  Market  Design  Flaw  in  the  current  process  is  that transmission
congestion  constraints  present  when  BME  schedules  HAM transactions are 
not
reflected  in the Real-Time settlement prices.  Under the rules set forth 
below,
the  transmission  congestion  costs present in BME will be reflected in the 
SCD
prices, so that a Market Participant proposing a HAM transaction will be 
charged
the  full  cost of supplying that transaction, up to the decremental bid cost 
or
sink  price  cap  bid  indicated  by  the Market Participant at the time the 
HAM
transaction was proposed.

Implementation Rules

1.   These rules apply in hours that HAM import or export transactions are
constrained in BME at an External Proxy Bus (EPB) by a transmission limitation
or Desired Network Interchange (DNI) limit (an ?EPB Limit?).

2.   For each hour in which an EPB Limit constrains net imports to NYCA from 
an
External Proxy Bus in the HAM, the Real-Time settlement price at that External
Proxy Bus will be the lesser of the real-time LBMP or the BME price at that
External Proxy Bus.

3.   For each hour which an EPB Limit constrains net exports from NYCA to an
External Proxy Bus in the HAM, the Real-Time settlement price at that External
Proxy Bus will be the greater of the real-time LBMP or the BME price at that
External Proxy Bus.

there are compelling indications that former operations at the Eunice

to the following questions at your earliest convenience:

1) is Texaco aware of the pipeline removal activities; 
2) has the release been stopped and how; 
3) has the extent of impacted soil been determined and does it extend onto 
NNG's property or down to groundwater; and 
4) has the NMOCD been notified. 

I am also concerned that other Texaco pipelines crossing near or through 
NNG's facility may also be in poor condition and should be checked, 
particularly the two lines which cross the southwestern corner of the NNG 
facility near the location of monitor well MW-3 (NNG's well which contains

Subject: NNG Eunice Station - Recent Development

Last week I received a message from the Eunice Team that Dynegy, the current 
owner of the adjacent Texaco Plant, had recently undertaken a project to 
remove a large diameter low pressure sour gas pipeline located just west of 
the NNG facility. The Team took photos of the removed section of pipe and the 
excavated soil. The removed pipe has at least two repair patches and there 
was considerable hydrocarbon stained soil removed from the pipe trench. Four 
of the Team's photos are attached with this message. Also attached is an 
updated diagram indicating the location of the removed section of pipe. The 
diagram is saved in a Microsoft HTML format that may require Microsoft 
Explorer to view. If you have trouble opening the file, refer to the diagram 
recently generated for the letter regarding the excavation activities. The 
location of the removed section runs from the western edge of the pit 
excavation area towards the north-northwest. This places the removed line 
within approximately 50 feet of our monitor well MW-3 (the well which has PSH 
above the water table).

New York Independent System Operator

Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208A:

Market Design Flaw Regarding HAM Transactions Failing Checkout


Applicability

This Extraordinary Correction Action (ECA) shall apply to:

?    Import and export transactions;
?    that are scheduled for an operating hour in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM) 
by
the Balancing Market Evaluation (BME); and
?    that fail checkout for reasons within the control of the Market
Participant, or that are cancelled at the request of said Market Participant.

Wheel-through transactions shall be treated as both an import and an export
transaction, and the relevant Market Participant shall be billed the sum of 
both
financial impacts, as provided below.  This ECA shall not apply to import,
export, or wheel-through transactions that fail checkout due to NYISO error or
action, or neighboring control area operator error or action.

Rationale

Import Transactions: During the HAM resolution, BME reduces commitments for
energy  resources  within  NYCA  to  accept  scheduled  import transactions 
at a
specific  proxy  bus  indicated  by the Market Participant.  Where the 
scheduled
import  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the real-time energy price 
at
the  proxy  bus  may  be  elevated  above the HAM price due to the failed 
import
transaction.   The  difference  between the real-time price and the BME price 
at
that  proxy  bus is currently charged to all purchasers in the real-time 
market.
Under  this  ECA,  this  amount  (when  positive),  multiplied  by the number 
of
megawatts  of  the  transaction  for  that  hour,  shall be billed to the 
Market
Participant that scheduled the failed import transaction as the financial 
impact
of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Export  Transactions:  During the HAM resolution, BME makes commitments for
energy  resources  to  supply  scheduled  export transactions up to the 
purchase
price  indicated  by the Market Participant at the appropriate proxy bus.  
Where
the  scheduled  export  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  the proxy bus may be depressed below the HAM price due to 
the
failed  export  transaction.   The  difference  between  the  BME  price and 
the
real-time  price  at that proxy bus is currently charged to all loads as part 
of
Schedule  1  costs.   Under this ECA, this amount (when positive), multiplied 
by
the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour, shall be billed to 
the
Market Participant that scheduled the failed export transaction as the 
financial
impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Wheel-Through   Transactions:  During  the  HAM  resolution,  BME  includes
scheduled wheel-through transactions up to the transmission congestion cost 
that
equals  the  decremental  bid  indicated  by  the Market Participant.  Where 
the
scheduled  wheel-through transaction fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  both  the  import  and export proxy busses may be elevated 
or
depressed,  respectively,  due  to the effects on transmission congestion of 
the
failed wheel-through transaction.  Under this ECA, the effects of the import 
and
export  portions  of  the  failed  wheel-through  transaction will be 
calculated
separately,  as though they were separate failed transactions.  The sum of 
those
impacts  shall  be  billed  to  the Market Participant that scheduled the 
failed
wheel-through  transaction  as  the  financial  impact of causing the failure 
to
complete checkout of the transaction.

Implementation Rules


1.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
delivered to the NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity
selling the amount of energy scheduled in BME into the LBMP Market at the
scheduling entity?s BME Bid Price, and buying the energy that was not 
delivered
from the LBMP Market at the Real-Time LBMP prevailing at the external Proxy
Generator Bus.  No payment will be required of the scheduling entity if it is
shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control 
Area
and the energy was not delivered due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
delivering Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the 
Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is lower
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to deliver scheduled energy.

2.   An External Transaction for the receipt of energy from the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
received from NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity 
buying
the amount of energy scheduled in BME from the LBMP Market at the scheduling
entity?s BME Bid Price and selling the energy that was not taken into the LBMP
Market at the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus.  No payment
will be required by the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External
Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not
taken by the scheduling entity due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
receiving Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is 
higher
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to take scheduled energy.

3.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at one
external Proxy Generator Bus and the delivery of energy from the NYCA at a
different external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which 
no
energy is delivered to or received from the NYCA in real-time, will be settled
by applying rules 1 and 2 of this ECA separately to the failed delivery of
energy to the import Proxy Generator Bus and the failed receipt of energy at 
the
export Proxy Generator Bus, and summing the total of the two amounts for 
payment
by the scheduling entity.  No payment will be required by the scheduling 
entity
if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each
Control Area and the energy was not taken by the scheduling entity due to an
error or action by the NYISO or the delivering or receiving Control Area.  No
payment will be required of, or made to the Market Participant for the import 
or
the export portion of the External Transaction if no payment would have been
required had that portion of the transaction been a separate transaction under
rule 1 or 2 of this ECA.

",Non Abusive
43531,campbell-l/all_documents/12.,<29203747.1075851877705.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I spoke at length today with Rod Boschee at PG&E.  The main focus of our 
discussion was logistics/planning for the upcoming 4/13/99 meeting between TW 
and PG&E representatives.  Mr. Boschee, as in earlier conversations this 
week, did not mention the 3/25 sample results.  Rather, it was agreed (also 
mandated by his boss, Bill Mazotti) that the time was ripe for a follow-on 
meeting to our initial discussion in Topock back in January.  I provided 
verbal notification to Mr. Boschee that Transwestern had retained an outside 
contractor for purposes of a decontamination process to be accomplished 
tomorrow at our filter separators.  In addition to my verbal notification, I 
told him that TW would provide PG&E with a letter, just to complete the paper 
trail.  I reinforced the importance of communication between the companies, 
both formal and informal.  A copy of the letter I faxed to Mr. Boschee is 
attached below.


Mr. Boschee will be preparing a draft agenda for the 4/13 meeting for TW to 
consider.  In addition to TW providing an update on all interim as well as 
long term plans for the lateral, Mr. Boschee noted two important items.  
First, PG&E would like more information regarding the proposed controlled 
Selexol flush.  Their concern is that the Selexol was colored initially as 
the culprit in this PCB issue, and now is being considered a part of a 
revised interim solution.  Secondly, PG&E would like to discuss the upcoming 
filter change at its station currently scheduled for 4/29.  

We've decided to meet in Las Vegas on 4/13.  The choice of Vegas seemed to be 
more centralized (vs. San Francisco), as well as more convenient for those of 
us travelling all the way from Houston.  PG&E is planning on having the 
following personnel attend the meeting:
 Rod Boschee-  Director of Contract Development
 Dave Anderson-  Attorney
 Mel Wong-  Project Manager, Topock Lateral project
 Jody Garcia-  District Superintendent, Barstow Dist.
 Tony Estrada-  Environmental
 2 as-yet-to-be-named Barstow team members

Transwestern is planning on having the following personnel attend the meeting:
 Jeff Fawcett- Marketing
 Louis Soldano-  Attorney
 Mike Nelson-  VP Operations
 Rich Jolly-  District Ops
 Larry Campbell-  Environmental
 Bob Iversen-  Technical advisor, Selexol/PCB matters
 Earl Chanley-  Engineering

The plan is to take Bill's plane from Houston, pick-up Mike Nelson in 
Amarillo, meet in Vegas, and return (with drop-off in Amarillo) to Houston in 
one day.  I'm coordinating the logistics with Virginia O'Neill.  My guess at 
this point is that we'll plan on being in Las Vegas by 10:30 a.m., with the 
meeting to begin at 11:00 a.m., a working lunch served at 12:00 noon, and 
adjourn somewhere around 2:00 p.m., with a return flight of 2:30 p.m.

Lou Soldano is in receipt of a few of Bill Cordes' suggestions to the letter 
that Bill will send out to Bill Mazotti that will: (1) outline the revised 
Interim Plan, including the Selexol flush, (2) notify him of our initiative 
to decon TW's filter/separators, and (3) reinforce our desire to meet on 
4/13.  If the logistics (KEYEX meeting) can be worked out, the letter will 
probably go out by Friday.

If you have any questions regarding the matters outlined above, please advise.",Non Abusive
43532,campbell-l/all_documents/120.,<18636661.1075851880319.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Mike, I spoke to Ralph and he gave me an open week of April 17th in San 
Francisco.  He thought that one day would be more that adequate.  I need to 
have somebody contact the PG&E side for their availablity during that week.  
Should I or someone else contact Rod Bosche or let Louie do this from his end 
with our legal contacting their legal? 

Some of the highlights that I had requested to Ralph for his presentation was 
the following:
 
  PCB's are a contaminant, just as benzene is, which occurs naturally in the 
gas.  Health issues of PCBs in pipeline are not a concern especially from a  
customer and employee standpoint (the name PCB lends itself to public outcry 
of the unknown)

 Removal of PCB's is best accomplished by managing liquids, not deconing

 Fiilter separators are a proven method of PCB removal

 Transwestern's proactive assistance with SoCal on their system to manage 
their PCBs

 Most pipelines on the east coast have PCB's and no adverse environmental 
impacts have occurred

I spoke with Ralph Komai, PCB expert for SoCal, concerning his availability 
to conduct a training session for PG&E and enlighten them on the reality of 
PCB's in natural gas pipelines.  He has stated that he would be available to 
do this as long as Transwestern picks up his expenses and hourly rate  
($200.00/hr).  As per your approval, Louie, I will inform Ralph that we are 
in agreement with his conditions and I will schedule a day when he would be 
available in California to put on the training for PG&E.

NRG respectfully requests a written clarification of the events and
consequences of the apparent schedule deviation on Phase I/II for December
08 HE21.  The data shows a schedule of 1100mw into NE and an actual flow of
450mw, a deficiency of at least 650mw for the entire hour.

Questions:
1. Is the data correct?  If no what was the error?  If yes see below;
2. Was there an emergency energy sale to HQ for this hour to cover the
deficiency?
3. What was the impact to energy and ancillary prices?
4. What was the impact on the NERC performance criteria (CPS1 and CPS2)?
5. Is the deficiency intended to be resolved thru inadvertent energy
account?


Below is the printout of the flow and schedule.

Thanks

A TRUE FRIEND

When you are sad ...
I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.

When you are blue ...
I'll try to dislodge what ever's choking you.

When you smile ...
I'll know you finally got laid.

When you are scared ...
I will rag you about it every chance I get.

When you are worried ...
I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and tell
you to quit whining.

When you are confused ...
I will use little words to explain it to your dumb ass.

When you are sick ...
Stay the hell away from me until you're well again, I don't want whatever
you have.

When you fall ...
I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.

This is my oath ...
I pledge till the end. Why you may ask? ...
Because you're my friend.

     Sunday's Oscar winners have nothing on San Francisco's venerable Gran

     seem destined to win increasing Hollywood scrutiny if not gold 
statuettes.

real-life drama, ""Erin

familiar logo in

in association
     with its gas pipelines can create their own dramas. 

     Just as the new movie, starring Julia Roberts, hit the theaters earlier 
this month, a new
     real-life problem confronted the combination utility with contaminates 
getting into the
     southern part of its California gas transmission system. 

     The movie is the story of a legal assistant --- a twice-divorced mother 
of three young
     children --- who single-handedly challenges PG&E, exposing its alleged 
operating
     mistakes that led to the use of chromium in its pipelines and eventually 
in the local water
     supply of a small, remote, high-desert town called Hinkley, which is 
about 130 miles
     northeast of Los Angeles. Lawsuits emerged in the early 1990s based on 
the
     development of tumors and other health problems among many of the 
Hinkley residents.
     By PG&E's own admission decades earlier it legally discharged wastewater 
containing
     chromium into the ground at its compressor station near Hinkley. Some of 
the chromium
     eventually got into the groundwater, and PG&E acknowledges it ""did not 
respond to (that)
     problem as openly, quickly or thoroughly as it should have."" It provided 
drinking water to
     nearby residents and arranged for medical exams for residents wishing to 
have them.
     PG&E also worked with local and state officials to clean up the problem. 
In 1996,
     however, PG&E settled a class action suit (one of several) with 650 
Hinkley residents for
     a record $333 million. 

     ""The movie is a dramatization and it is pretty entertaining, so I liked 
it,"" said Jon
     Tremayne, a PG&E utility spokesperson. 

     PG&E CEO Robert Glynn told his employees, ""It's clear in retrospect that 
our company
     should have handled some things differently at that time. And I wish 
that it had."" 

     Litigation against the big energy firm continues. Involving the same 
transmission pipeline
     and geographical areas, the current PCBs found in PG&E's interstate 
supplies are
     coming through excelr's Transwestern Pipeline unit at the 
California-Arizona border from
     New Mexico but are not at harmful levels at this point in time. Routine 
testing early in
     February turned up the suspected cancer-causing chemical, which was used 
as a
     lubricant in high-pressure pipelines and compressor stations until it 
was banned. 

     ""What we are talking about here is very low levels (ranging from 2 to 22 
parts-per-million,
     or ppm), well below (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) levels 
(50 ppm),""
     according to Tremayne. 

     Since the installation of a series of filter separators on both sides of 
the
     California-Arizona border, PG&E has concentrated on testing and 
following up along its
     southern transmission system that extends some 350 miles to the town of 
Kettleman in
     the northwestern part of the central San Joaquin Valley. PCB traces have 
been found,
     and PG&E has been working with the local gas distributor in the area, 
Southwest Gas
     Corp., to test for signs of PCBs in the nearby Barstow and Victor Valley 
distribution
     systems. As of March 22, none of the definitive results were in and 
there won't be much
     before the end of this month, according to Tremayne. 

     Both state regulators and the federal EPA have been notified of the 
situation. The federal
     EPA confirmed that PCBs are authorized for use in concentrations below 
50 ppm. It is
     the EPA laboratory tests that showed PCBs were known to cause cancer in 
laboratory
     rats. 

     PG&E spokespeople were assuring the public last week that the utility 
will ""take any
     additional actions necessary"" as a result of data from the ongoing 
testing it is doing of its
     transmission system and interconnecting distribution pipeline systems. 
And the utility is
     planning to install additional filter separators at various locations 
along its pipeline. 

     PCB-containing lubricating oils once were used routinely by a number of 
U.S. pipeline
     companies in their gas pipeline compressors, which help push the fuel 
through the pipes.
     While they are no longer used, some of the oils have remained inside 
some pipelines since
     the 1960s and 70s. If present, they are carried in liquid droplets in 
the natural gas stream. 

     Between the newly released motion picture and PG&E's local wrestling 
match with the
     PCBs, another class action lawsuit against PG&E stemming from the 
original chromium
     issue heads toward trial, pushed by residents in Topock, AZ and former 
residents of
     Hinkley not involved in the first suit. A trial date has been set for 
Nov. 27, and CNN's
     ""CourtTV"" program is proposing to provide live coverage.

Discussion List:

Greetings,

I was surprised today to learn that MSWG is recommending a delay in the
implementation of zonal price capped load bidding until the fall, when
it can be implemented simultaneously with virtual bidding.

The priority assigned to zonal PCLB is a settled issue and one that is
not properly before the MSWG or BIC at this time. The NYISO Management
and Board have already determined that implementation of zonal PCLB by
May is one of the ISO's highest priorities. Implementation of zonal PCLB
by this summer is even part of the NYISO Business Plan, Goal and
Objectives, and Incentive Compensation plan. In addition, the project
prioritization process adopted by the Management Committee has ratified
the priority assigned to this critical effort.

Apart from sporadic concerns raised by a few generators, there has never
been any indication that zonal PCLB should be delayed until virtual
bidding can be implemented. Indeed, it appears that the decision by the
MSWG to advance this proposal was decided upon at the last meeting of
the Virtual Bidding Task Force which does not even have official
standing as a NYISO subcommittee. That meeting's material did not in any
way indicate that such a major change was being contemplated, let alone
that it would be a recommendation to the BIC less than a week later.

The Price Responsive Load Coalition strongly supports the ISO's previous
decisions to implement zonal PCLB by this summer and views it as a
critical component of the state's efforts to engage loads' participation
in the market in a meaningful way. We will oppose any efforts to delay
implementation simply because some generators raise speculative fears of
""manipulation"" of the markets by loads.

While there may well be merit to implementing zonal PCLB and virtual
bidding simultaneously, the proposal now before us threatens to throw
the baby out with the bathwater, depriving customers of one of their
only means of ameliorating the effects of markets that may not be
workably competitive.

From both a procedural and substantive perspective, the proposal
presented to the BIC is fundamentally defective and must be rejected.

Sincerely,
Aaron Breidenbaugh

Vince - 

I certainly appreciate the opportunity to have our group attend
a session given by excelr Research.  While afternoons are typically
the best time to meet, we do have a trader's meeting each Mon & Wed
at 3:30.  If we can accomodate this regular meeting either by scheduling
an earlier meeting on Monday or going for Tue/Thurs, that would be 
great.  Otherwise we can go ahead with the Mon @ 3:30 with an audience
that might be a bit smaller.

Thanks again

EPA has changed their interpretation of the E& P, T & S MACT regulations that 
would have an impact on the registrations required in June of this year. The 
API representatives apparently agreed with the EPA interpretations. The 
Environmental Notice on the intranet will be changed to reflect these 
changes. 

Dehys  that are Major Sources for HAPs must be registered with EPA on June 
17, 2000. Previously it was understood that your Major Source status on June 
17, 2000 would determine if you register a facility. EPA has indicated that 
your status on June 17, 1999 would determine whether or not a site is 
registered.

For dehys regulated under the E & P MACT regulations (this does not impact 
the T & S MACT), you determine your major source status by first determining 
if the dehys at a location exceed 10 tons/year of any one HAP or 25 tons/year 
of all HAPs. If they do you must register the location with EPA. If not a 
Major Source because of dehys, you must then determine the HAP emissions from 
the greatest non-dehy source of HAP emissions (typically a recip engine). If 
the HAP emissions from this source alone exceed 10/25 tons/year, the location 
must be registered with EPA. If not you do not need to register. You no 
longer need to determine HAP emissions from the entire site to determine 
Major Source status.

If you have any questions, give me call at 713-646-7646.

Since it's been two months since we have heard from you we wanted to check 
back with you and see if there is anything we can do to help you with your 
diamond buying decision? Our goal is to help you make an informed decision 
that you will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, since we don't own 
these stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find 
the very best diamond for you at a great price.

Since you have not responded to any of our emails these past 8 weeks, we 
assume you are no longer shopping for a diamond and will remove your name 
from our active customer list.  We hope that if you are still shopping you 
will contact us so we can help you find a great diamond.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Please see the attached file and notes on this years pigging activites from
Station 5 through Needles.  This does not include all the analyticals for
this time period but should represent 90% of all pigging activites.  Filter
and scrubber samples may also exist.

Larry can you give a hand with this?  I thought these results were already
forwarded to Penn State weeks ago and being forwarded on an ongoing basis.
They have yet to receive any historical sampling data either.  Please

This is an announcement of a working policy for making service across
the Blackwater tie into WSCC in the event the SPS , bundled,
grandfathered is temporarily interrupted.  In order to preserve
competition without displacing the reservation close to the ramp, SPS
has agreed to notify SPP prior to the top of each hour whether or not
they will be making any attempt to restore the IP agreement at the top
of the next hour.  Once that designation has been declared, SPP will
open the market at the top of the hour for next-hour only service to the
BLKW DC Tie.  SPS has stated that 12/12/2000 HE 19 will be available for
service.  A similar notice will be posted to the OASIS and SPP will
follow this policy until further notice.

groundwater. Groundwater samples were collected from these wells on April 
5th. Lab results indicate elevated concentrations of halogenated organic 
compounds in samples collected from two of the wells. Three replacement wells 
will be drilled for the two wells which do not produce water and for one of 
the wells which only has two feet of water in the screen interval. The 
installation of the replacement wells is tentatively scheduled for the week 
of May 8th. A feasibility study for active remediation measures in the former 
impoundment area has been completed.  
The Lockridge semiannual groundwater sampling was completed.  Results will be 
forwarded to the state of Texas.
The quarterly groundwater sampling at the NNG Gomez Plant was completed. The 
recovery system was shutdown from January 17th through April 21st in order to 
evaluate the accumulation rate of PSH in recovery wells. The accumulation 
rate of PSH has been reduced considerably from the accumulation rate prior to 
active remediation. The system was re-started on April 21st and will be 
operated in a similar manner as it was operated prior to the shutdown. 
Transwestern Pipeline Company met with officials of PG&E to discuss recent 
sampling activities on the PG&E system with respect to PCB's.  Results of the 
sampling efforts have shown that PCB's have moved downstream into existing 
interconnects and into lines which feed customers.  PG&E has indicated that 
they will install small filter separators at these interconnects at pricing 
thus far of around $2MM.  This does not include the costs for the mainline 
filter separators which should be in service in June of this year.   PG&E has 
indicated that they will continue sampling at downstream locations to further 
determine the ""front of PCB's""
A revised Title V application was submitted for the Keystone C/S turbine 
""power unit"" replacement.   Fuel monitoring and emissions testing under NSPS 
will be initiated pending completion of the turbine component replacement. 
A meeting was held in Gallup to discuss the forthcoming pipeline PCB modeling 
project to be initiated in Arizona.  Environmental concerns relating to 
management and disposal of the liquids, permitting and compliance issues were 
discussed.   This project will be initiated between C/S 4 and C/S 3.  If 
successful, the modeling approach and methodology will be implemented 
throughout the contaminated portions of Transwestern Pipeline.

Home Officing- Employees within OTS and EHS have been asked to pilot a 
telecommunicating and home officing program.  The reson being to make 
available desirable office space within the excelr, Three Allen Center and 
Brookhollow office buildings.

MIke Terraso's Replacement-    John Shafer has been selected to replace Mike 
Terraso as V.P. of GPG for Environmental and Safety.  John was formerly 
Director of Environmetnal and Safety for ANR Pipeline out of Chicago, Ill.  
John will assume responsibilities within excelr on May 8.

Performance Testing of Grandfathered Units-   There was some confusion with 
repsect to the internal position within GPG of testing grandfathered units.  
It was understood by some team members that internal portable emissions 
testing would only occur if the grandfathered unit had permitted limits on an 
air permit  or if there was a special need by the DES.  In order to clarify 
this issue, Bill will discuss this with legal and distribute a notice to the 
appropriate individuals within GPG outlining the GPG position on testing . 

Skill Base Pay- Bill is suggesting a reworking of the O&M, field trainee, and 
Level I, II and III training modules and TV Guides by the SBP review 
committee.  Bill will distribute to the committee existing documents for 
reworking and revision.  The committee will reveiw, make changes and return 
back to Bill by the mid term review meeting.

O&G MACT-    Bill will approach Marc Phillips about conducting an internal 
training for all DES personal on the forthcoming notification and conditions 
of the Oil and Gas MACT regulation and its applicability to the facilities in 
GPG.  Bill will notify each DES as to when the meeting is scheduled and 
where.  An excelr letter will be developed and distributed to the field by 5/5 
to notify EPA of those facilities which are impacted by the new MACT 
regulations.  It will be the DES's responsibility to make the notification to 
the EPA.

MId Term Peer Review Meeting-   Bill Kendrick, Rick Cates and Ken Crowl will 
keep the DES's apprised of the details relevant to the mid term review 
process and procedures to be employed for doing the review.

Cooling Tower Issue-     A request was made by BIll Kendrick to send legal a 
list of histortic or active cooling tower sites within GPG, that may have 
impacted groundwater at a site.   The criteria to be used for this 
notification is knowledge of chromate use in the cooling tower and/or  
relative proximity to a nearby recptor (drinking water well). 

Tracking Cleanup Costs-    MIke Terraso has requested work orders to be 
generated for tracking costs associated with cleanup and remedation of spills 
and releases.  The ""cut line"" for the work order generation is $1,000.

Subject: Sta. 6 UST Excavation

Norm:
Per our telephone discussion this afternoon, I suggest you go ahead and 
backfill what remains of the open excavation that was created when the diesel 
UST was removed. A closure report was submitted to Ms. Bernacik of the Laguna 
Pueblo Environmental Department in January. We have not received a formal 
response from the Pueblo yet, but in a phone conversation, Ms. Bernacik 
indicated that they would have to take a closer look at the report before 
making a decision. Regardless, I don't think we need to wait on an approval 
of the closure report before backfilling the excavation. 
Thanks, George

I sent a letter to Mike Katz, copy to Rod Boschee, that formally restated 
what I had requested at our last meeting in San Francisco. They responded 
with what they agree to, which I believe we can (and will have to) live with.

I will not be attending the meeting this Thursday due to conflicts, but will 
be available to attend via phone.

1.  TW will fund in year 2000 the installation of the necessary PG&E customer 
filter separators and the additional costs related to PG&E's PCB testing.

action items
GQC: Thoroughly review PG&E customer F/S sites and costs. Formally get 
agreement.

Earl: Prepare a new work order for $3,000,000 naming specific sites and costs 
related to sampling and analysis.

Note: I have requested an additional $3,000,000 for this years Capital Plan 
to do this work, which Bill has received verbally from Stan. 

2. PG&E will lift the 250 / D limit and move to market driven conditions of 
up to 300 / D at Topock on May 15 with on-going monitoring to ensure no 
further migration of PCB's. They wish for a six month test on this condition.

action item:
Rich: Review formal pigging and sampling plan with Tiny and Needles Team.

Rich / Larry: Increase or reinforce pigging and analysis on Topock Lateral, 
as well as any mainline pigging and analysis required due to Gallup increase 
volumes.

3. PG&E will delay / defer consideration of deconning the Topock Compressor 
Station until 2001. Tests in 2001 will determine further consideration.

4. Establishment of a gas quality committee (GQC): Larry, Rich, Earl. (I will 
continue as the lead on this with Louis Saldano available)  

GQC: Take and distribute formal minutes with agreed action items.

43621,campbell-l/all_documents/136.,<2714955.1075851880699.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project.

Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on 
schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system.  
PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of 
separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon 
tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not 
create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, 
according to PG&E, are in place.

PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to 
discuss maintenance issues with ET&S.

Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. 
pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or 
disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E 
will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or 
dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has 
indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce 
costs associated with cleaning the pipe.

2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. 

Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at 
MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round 
of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples 
collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to 
be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels 
north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing 
showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has 
been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be 
collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant 
to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is 
considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's.

Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The 
gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas 
Co.  system which is PCB free.

3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. 

West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system 
has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these 
locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to 
have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the 
sampling program.  
Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs 
under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the 
pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the 
bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By 
increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced.

It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the 
separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks.

4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators.

Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter 
separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The 
determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1) 
a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of 
the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm.
Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station) 
have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern 
River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have 
shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this 
location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that 
there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume 
of gas deliveries.

PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional 
filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer 
load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection 
at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express 
additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations.

5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators.

 a. Siting, Design and Engineering

 b. Cost Estimates 

PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus 
an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next 
week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter 
separators may be proposed for installation.  

The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29 
indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have 
not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites 
basis as PG&E presented.

One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions 
of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement 
company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the 
success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the 
cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it 
will be a 2001 project.

6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection.

Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic 
sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to 
the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the 
Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies 
to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will 
coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle.

7. Other Issues or Concerns.

Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January, 
2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to 
Transwestern.  

PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300 
mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S 
configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day.  

8. Next Steps.

The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow 
inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection   
additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location 
of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as 
some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on 
other business.  ",Non Abusive
43622,campbell-l/all_documents/137.,<29790324.1075851880722.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Another meeting was held with PG&E to discuss results of the latest sampling 
and construction activities on their system.  DAta from sampling has shown 
that PCB's are steadily increasing into further portions of the PG&E system.  
The latest sampling results showed positive hits on their mainline system at 
MP 63.26 where 4 oz. of liquids were removed from a siphon.  The analytical 
result of this liquid was 10 ppm.  PG&E and Southwest Gas are continuing 
their internal sampling efforts to identifiy additional places within their 
systems where PCB's may collect  and would be passed on to their customers.  
It should also be noted that  PG&E is and will be continuing their efforts of 
installing small filter separators at strategic interconnects to protect and 
remove PCBs from entering customer and LDC lines.

Annual emissions inventories were submitted to the TNRCC for the TW  Walton 
and NNG Seminole and Plainview C/S's

Title V air permits were receied from Region IX EPA for the Leupp and 
Klagetoh C/S's, which are on the Navajo Reservation.  A roles and 
responsibilities meeting was held with the Flagstaff Team for the Leupp Title 
V permit.  A meeting will be scheduled with the Gallup in the near future to 
assign roles and responsibilities for the Klagetoh permit.

 
 The Quarterly groundwater sampling has been completed at the NNG Gomez Plant.

Semiannual groundwater sampling has been completed at the following 
Transwestern locations:  C/S No. 5 Thoreau, North Crawar C/S.  Semi annual 
groundwater sampling has been completed at the NNG Lockridge facility.

Three additional groundwater monitoring wells will be installed at  C/S No.

Subject: RE: mea culpa



  Public Statement by the Rev. Jesse Jackson

  Due to the great consternation caused by the
  revelation of my act of procreation, I accept my
  obligation to give an explanation to the
  population for my act of copulation.

  I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of
  sexual gratification, that I could not obtain through
  masturbation, resulted in my fornication.
   I accepted her invitation, and provided her with
  excitation, stimulation, penetration, replication, and
  liberation.

  She provided lubrication (to avoid inflammation) and I
  wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried  for
  duplication but I insisted upon
  termination, in spite of her fascination with
  variation.

  This has caused me great aggravation, and the
  agitation and provocation of the media has resulted in
  my humiliation, denigration, and
  degradation. My wife is considering castration, which
  would require my hospitalization.

  Pray that this matter will find culmination in my
  sanctification and rehabilitation so that my plans for
  nomination to my ultimate vocation will not result in
  revocation and termination.I hope this proclamation
  has provided illumination and verification and will
  prohibit further provocation (or investigation).

  Sincerely,
  The Rev. Jesse Jackson

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage excelr's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for excelr travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following

IDEAL IN FANCY CUTS

While there is a wealth of information about the various
definition of ideal cut round brilliant diamonds, most consumers
have no idea what constitutes great cut for the fancy cut
diamonds such as pear, heart, oval, marquise, princess, emerald
or radiant.  There is no one industry standard for round let
alone fancy cuts, but there are some specific guidelines that we
use when we search for diamond.

Each fancy shape has its own set of depth percentage, table
percentage, crown height percentage and length to width ratio
that will increase the likelihood that the diamond will have
great brilliance, sparkle and beauty.

If you are shopping for a fancy cut diamond and are interested
what specifications define the top cut class for that shape,
give us a call and we will be happy to discuss this with you.

BULLETPROOF BEAUTY
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Beauty meets the bulletproof vest in a gown designed for Miss
Israel to wear at the Miss Universe pageant next month.  The
top of the silk dress, embroidered with diamonds and pearls,
is covered by an army-issue flak jacket adorned with diamonds
for a so-called softer look, the Associated Press reported.

The dress sends a message that everyday life should go on
despite renewed violence, its designer said.  ``I want people
in Israel to continue to go out,'' said Galit Levi, a Tel Aviv
fashion designer. ``But be careful.''

Levi also designed two prior Miss Universe dresses. In 1998,
her design featured the faces of Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat
and Bill Clinton, leaders known for Middle East peace efforts.
In 1999, the first Arab Miss Israel, Rana Raslan, wore a dress
with a large red Star of David, an Israeli symbol.

Ilanit Levy, an 18-year-old soldier from Haifa, will wear the
bulletproof dress in the Miss Universe competition May 11 in
Puerto Rico


$500 MILLION HEIST FOILED IN LONDON
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Would-be thieves crashed a bulldozer into London's Millennium
Dome on Nov. 7, hoping to snatch $500 million worth of
diamonds=01*including the spectacular 203-ct. De Beers Millennium
Star. The robbers planned to make their getaway in a speedboat
waiting on the Thames River. It would have been the world's
largest robbery, but the diamonds were already gone from
their tented exhibition arena, and Scotland Yard was waiting.
Officers disguised as cleaners overpowered the robbers, and a
dozen men were arrested without a shot fired.

Tipped off by police, dome officials had replaced the gems
with crystal fakes. De Beers officials say the pear-shaped
Millennium Star is arguably the most perfect large diamond in
the world.

Four men were arrested after trapping themselves in the vault
that usually houses the diamonds. Police picked up another
near a speedboat on the river, and a sixth man on the opposite
shore. Six others were apprehended later in southeastern
England.

Representatives of the New Millennium Experience Co., which
operates the dome, said the diamonds are displayed in an
exhibition area of the facility called the ""money zone"" and
are closely guarded. The Millennium Star is displayed in a
reinforced glass cylinder, and the area has alarms and
security cameras. The collection also features 11 large
diamonds of a distinctive vivid blue color.

Police said the robbers, apparently disguised as workmen,
crashed through a perimeter fence and drove the bulldozer
past security guards at around 9:30 a.m., shortly after the
attraction opened for the day. As they entered the building,
they donned gas masks before unleashing smoke bombs.
Fortunately, none of the estimated 100 visitors in the tent
were nearby.

Disguised police were positioned around the inside of the
dome. After the robbers went into the vaults and became
trapped, they were ordered to come out at gunpoint by the
officers. The intruders were captured as they bashed at the
display cases with hammers and sledgehammers.


PLATINUM PRICES HAVE SOARED
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
For the past ten years, platinum prices have fluctuated
between $350-$450 per troy ounce on the commodity markets.
In the second half of 1999 the prices start a climb that
saw prices move from $350 to almost $650 per ounce at the
start of this year.  This increase is mostly due to the
big increase in demand in platinum jewelry while supplies
have not been able to keep up.  Check out the price chart
at http://futures.tradingcharts.com/prairielinks/PL/M
that plots this trend.  Note how there are some weeks
where the price has $100 swings.

The impact on you the consumer is two fold, the prices you
pay today are almost twice what they were a year ago and
the supply of parts for mountings and jewelry can sometimes
take weeks to restock.  The other impact is that if you
bought jewelry with significant platinum content, it is
now worth more and would cost more to replace.  If your
appraisal is more than one year old, you might want to
consider having it reappraised for insurance purposes.


CLARITY GRADING
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Undoubtedly, size is an important factor in determining
the clarity grade.  The more difficult it is to see an
inclusion, particularly face-up, the less it will
influence the clarity grade.

Almost as a part of size, the number of inclusions must
be considered.  Clarity grading does not, however, consist
of merely counting inclusions, but rather judging how
readily that number can be seen.  A stone could, for
example, have a number of minute pinpoints and still be
graded high on the scale.  Usually one or two of the
largest inclusions will establish the grade.  Additional
inclusions, if small or minute, will have little or no
effect on the grade.

The position of an inclusion affects how readily it can be
seen.  Cutters call the area seen through the table the
""heart"" of the stone and make every effort to orient rough
stones so that inclusions are not visible through the
table of the finished stone.  The preferred position for
inclusions is under the bezel facets or near the girdle
because they are less noticeable there.

Sometimes inclusions are located where they cause
multiple reflections in the pavilion facets when you look
at the stone in the face-up position.  Such reflectors
lower the clarity grade more than similar non-reflecting
inclusions.

The type of inclusion can sometimes influence the clarity
grade.  Most inclusions do not threaten a diamond's
durability.  Remember, long before a stone ever reaches
the consumer, it has already been subjected to considerable
heat and stress in both the cutting and manufacturing
processes. It is unlikely to get rougher treatment simply
by being worn.  But large cleavages or feathers,
particularly when they reach the table or extend from the
crown through the girdle, are potentially hazardous since
they could be extended by a severe blow.

Most inclusions are white or colorless, but sometimes
they are black, brown, dark red, or green.  These, or
course, are easier to see and lower the clarity grade more
than a colorless inclusion.  However, curiously enough,
a dark inclusion dead center under the table is often
surprisingly inconspicuous.

Most inclusions have little impact on the beauty of the
diamond since they are not visible with the naked eye.
The high price associated with high clarity has more to
do with rarity than beauty.  If most diamonds were flawless,
it is likely that included diamonds would command the
greatest interest and price.


OCTAHEDRON
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D
The octahedron is the most common form of gem quality
diamond crystals.  The octahedron is shaped like two
pyramids, one upside down and fastened at the bases.
Perfectly formed octahedrons, called glassies, are among
the most striking of all mineral crystals.  Rough crystals
with this shape are well suited to be cut into the popular
round and princess shapes.


WHERE DIAMONDS FORM
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Diamonds form only under certain chemical, temperature,
and pressure conditions.  Scientists estimate that the
necessary conditions of temperature and pressure can exist
in parts of the Earth's mantle (inside the crust) between
75 and 120 miles beneath the Earth's surface.

Almost all diamonds are carried to the surface by a specific
type of peridotite rock called kimberlite.  The Australian
diamonds were carried by a similar type of rock called
lamproite.  For billions of years, kimberlites have
periodically carried diamonds to the Earth's surface.

We call diamond deposits in kimberlite pipes primary
deposits.  The kimberlite itself is not very tough so it
breaks down with sunlight, heat and cold, wind and rain, and
other environmental forces.  The diamonds often get washed
out of the pipe and into the beds of rivers where they
gather in potholes and eddies. These are called alluvial
deposits.  If the river currents are strong enough, they
may carry their diamonds all the way to the sea.  There
the stones either settle to the bottom or are washed back
onto the beach.  These diamond rich areas are called
marine deposits.  Diamonds found in alluvial and marine
deposits and in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks are said
to be from secondary deposits.

An issue surfaced during the conduct of the current Spring 2001
TCC Auction related to import limit to New York from Hydro
Quebec (HQ) .  In one round of the Spring auction, bids were
received requesting a large number of TCCs with a POI of the
HQ Proxy bus.  These bids, if awarded, would exceed the HQ
import limit of 1200 MW used in the TCC auctions.

The 1200 MW HQ import limit was based on internal conversations
within the NYISO.  These conversations indicated that congestion
differences between the HQ Proxy bus and internal New York buses
would be produced in SCUC at the 1200 MW import level.  One
auction participant questioned the modeling of the HQ import limit.
After further review, the NYSIO agreed that the HQ import limit used
in the TCC auctions could be increased to 1500 MW, as long as
the same SCUC operating policy for the HQ import was followed.
This policy allows for a 1500 MW HQ import, if at least 300 MW of
that import is due to wheel through transactions.

The ISO will implement this operating policy in the TCC auction as
follows.  TCC awarded from the HQ Proxy bus to internal New York
buses will be limited to 1200 MW.  Total TCC awards from the HQ
Proxy bus will be limited to 1500 MW.  TCCs awarded in the reverse
direction (i.e., into the HQ Proxy bus) will net against those TCCs
awarded in the opposite direction.  Also, existing uses of the
transmission system will be included.  Existing uses include
Grandfathered Rights, Grandfathered TCCs and TCCs awarded
in previous auctions that have not expired.

To incorporate this operating policy in subsequent TCC auctions,
the following bidding rule is being established:

For TCC bids from the HQ Proxy bus to an internal New York bus or
zone and from an internal New York bus or zone to the HQ Proxy bus,
PTID 61844 must be used for the POI or POW as appropriate.

For TCC bids that represent wheels through from the HQ Proxy bus to
another external proxy bus (i.e., NE Proxy, OH Proxy, PJM Proxy) and
from another external proxy bus to the HQ Proxy bus, PTID 23651 must
be used as the POI or POW as appropriate.

These PTID designations will allow the NYISO to identify TCC bids and
properly model those bids as they relate to the Hydro Quebec import
limit in the TCC auction.

PTIDs 61844 and 23651 were chosen because the LBMPs and the
individual components of the LBMPs in the Day-Ahead market are identical.

This new bidding opportunity in the TCC auctions will be allowed
beginning with the May 2001 Reconfiguration Auction scheduled for
April 23, 2001.

on the SoCal system, for which Transwesten is 86% responsible, Ralph Komai, 
SoCal's PCB person provded some addtional information with respect to what is 
going on with the PCB activities on the SoCal system.  As a result of the 
PG&E press release, SoCal management directed additional sampling to be done 
at their interconnect with Transwestern and downstream of this interconnect.  
Ralph reported that a number of liquid samples came back at around 7 ppm, 
however one sample at their Kelso Station, near Barstow,  came back at 77 
ppm. 

Ralph had indicated that there has been an increase in the PCB's coming into 
their collection locations in the Needles area as evidenced by the following:

 Based upon 1997 data, almost no liquids greater than 50 ppm were revcovered

 Data collected in 1998 showed that approx. 8% of the liquids were greater 
than 50 ppm

 Data collected in 1999 showed that approx. 9% of the liquids were greater 
than 50 ppm

Based upon this, Ralph had stated that SoCal would be collecting additional 
sampling information and possibly entering into an internal montoring 
program, somewhat like PG&E is currently doing now.

I had informed Ralph that our Needles M/S facility had seen almost no liquids 
in the last 5 years, other than a recent accumulation of a one time pigging 
in early 2000 when a small volume of liquids (less than 55 gallons) had been 
collected.   We discussed that the accumulations seen on the SoCal system 
were probably from existing liquids on their system which had collected in 
low points in their pipeline and were moving downstream due to the increased 
flows from TW into SoCal.  

Ralph gave the impression that there were no immediate management tensions 
resulting from the recent ""hits"".  He just indicated that they would be 
watching their system and sampling at a more frequent basis.",Non Abusive

To Market Participants:

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO will premier its

? new website design. The visual
presentation of the site is
being refreshed to convey a bold presence on the Internet and present a clear,
consistent, hi-tech look and
feel to the site. This represents the completion of phase I of the web refresh
project and is part of the
NYISO Strategic Initiatives.

For a period of two weeks (until May 8, 2001), both the new and old websites
will be operated in parallel.
On May 8, 2001 (unless notified differently), the old site will be 
discontinued.
The NYISO has planned
the transition to be as seamless as possible for our Market Participants and
Guests.

Several paths are available to access the new site. Direct links will be 
placed
on the NYISO home page
and on the What?s New page under Hot Topics. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE BOOKMARKS OR
SCRIPT FILES!!!!!!!!!!!! Once the transition period is ended, the NYISO will
rename the server
containing the new website to the address of the old website. With this plan,
Users will NOT be required
to modify bookmarks and/or script files.

The URL addresses for the MIS portion of the web site, the billing statements,
and the LBMP data HAVE
NOT and WILL NOT change. Access to these areas of the site will not change and
Users will not need to
modify any procedures.

What Users can expect to see is consistent fonts, style rules, symbols, 
colors,
etc. This will enhance
navigation and improve the functionality of the site. Phase II of this project
will address site architecture,
file structure, and make substantial improvements to site navigation and data
content. Information
gathered from onsite interviews with Market Participants from each sector will
be used in the
implementation of Phase II changes.

Market Participants should contact their Customer Relations Representative if
they have any questions,

There are no Transwestern facilities in the Farmington resource area which 
will be impacted by this proposed level, however the potential exists for 
several Transwestern locations in southeast New Mexico to be impacted.  

A meeting was held with the president of Del Mar, concerning the issues 
associated with the lead in their lead acetate tape for monitoring sulfur 
concentrations in the natural gas.  A  request  was made to the company to 
determine the feasability of recycling the tape and eleviate the management 
and disposal issues associated with the tape as a hazardous waste.  

The quarterly SoCal Transwestern PCB conference call was held this week.  
Transwesten's share (86%) of SoCal's PCB management activities was approx. 
$79,000.  Due to the press release  by PG&E concerning the increased 
occurance of PCB's into their system, SoCal has initiated increased sampling 
activities on their system and will be proposing to do additional monitoring 
to track liquids from Transwestern's M/S into the SoCal system.  Preliminary 
sampling results at strategic liquids locations on the SoCal system has 
revealed hits of PCB's in the range of 7-10 ppm, although, a  hit of 77 ppm  
was discovered.

PG&E C/S in excess of regulated levels, a  conference call was held the ET&S 
VP to determine forthcoming activities with PG&E.  A meeting has been

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage excelr's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for excelr travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from excelr's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for excelr 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of excelr 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the excelr Travel Program intranet @ gss.excelr.com <http://gss.excelr.com/>.

the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

  NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI,
respectively.

 While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter  requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that  having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


  NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

I agree with Mark. Further, in setting the baseline, the LOLP study
obviously assumed an annual structure for maintenance scheduling and a lack
of diversity in terms of outage rates for summer versus winter. These
assumptions no longer are valid if the time step for planning becomes a
capability period. Each reliability period would have to stand on its own,
and you would have to entirely redo the assumptions about scheduled outages
and come up with seasonal availabilities. My guess is that given the
incentive to be around in the summer for the higher energy payments, these
values should be highly skewed.

Finally, lets also just cut to the chase. Even if this study were correct in
its current form, what obviously is going on is an attempt to ""evade"" 50% of
the deficiency charge. Applying this type of argument on seasonal installed
requirement to deficiency payments just doesn't fly. If you believe that the
current values for the deficiency payments are ""correct"" to begin with, it
would make sense to me to at minimum allocate the deficiency charges by the
LOLP incurrence, e.g. if 90% of the annual LOLP is in the summer period,
then 90% of the deficiency should probably follow this allocation. Remember,
the incentive is to force people to build, the cost of being short ever
really should stay the same, or you diminish the incentive and thus undercut
the entire reliability structure.

the ICAP market.  If we are going to consider a change in this direction
then we also have to apply most of the annual deficiency rate to the summer
period.

Subject:        NYPA study-Winter Locational ICAP requirements

<< File: NYPA_LR_wint.PDF >>  << File: TRAN_SYS_001129.PDF >>          At
NYPA's
request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the
locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and Long Island,
respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter ratings on the
transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how much the 80% and
98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the statewide Loss
Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter requirements of 75% and
92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI, respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational
requirements, the results from this study suggest that some reduction in the
winter  requirement may be warranted and a consideration of seasonal
requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP requirement studies.
NYPA believes that having an ICAP requirement for summer and winter seasons
based on the LSE's peak load for the respective season would send the proper
ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to
begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination of
locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In response to some E-mails on the subject report we offer the following
comments.  We believe expressing the locational requirement as a function of
the capability period peak sends a better price signal to LSE's.  Some LSE
loads will have larger peak in summer and others may be balanced or even
peak in the winter.  Seasonal ICAP would facilitate capacity exchanges
between summer and winter peaking areas.

As a practical matter the requirement can be expressed any way.   For this
exercise we just left it as a percentage of the summer peak because it
provides a reference point to the current requirement and illustrates an
order of magnitude of the potential reduction in the winter requirement that
may be justified through an examination of the seasonal risk.   We agree
completely that all issues, including deficiency charges, modeling, etc.,
must be considered in any methodological change.  There was no intent to
suggest everything else would remain unchanged.",Non Abusive

liquids collection at the PGE Topock C/S filter separator (F/S), presented 
below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred 
6/29/00.

Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the 
cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water 
mixture).  Diesel was not used in the deconning process.  The only equipment 
cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S.  Transwestern's filters in its separator 
were replaced,  but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit.   
The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator.

The following samples were collected during this project:

On the Transwestern side:

 1. Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters 
were removed.  Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of   
PCB's.  (Not 100 sq. cm. sample)

 2. A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator 
at the Selexol Plant.  The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 

 3. Composite sample of the fine powdery rust  which had collected in the 
bottom of the F/S.   Approximte volume one cup.  
 
 4. Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S. Visible appearance of 
the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and    virtually 
unstained.  A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter 
confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S. 

 5. A sample of an unused clean stocked filter.  This was a control sample. 


On the PG&E side:

 1. A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter 
separator prior to deconning.  Approx. volume one cup

 2. Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the 
F/S.  An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S   prior 
to deconning was approximately one gallon.

 3. Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100 
cm sq. wipe)

 4. Used filter media from the F/S.  The operation of the F/S filters are 
designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter.  Composite samples   
were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters.

 5. Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls. 

The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process 
was the volume and  buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material 
which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount 
of rust colored material which was present  in Transwestern's F/S .  As 
previously mentioned, samples were collected of  both materials.  The only 
difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the 
volume.  It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of 
99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had 
over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S.  The small amount of rust 
materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging 
activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S.  I will have 
reprensentataive samples of both materials.  

Photographs  were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and 
will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in Flagstaff with 
PG&E.
on the 13th of July.  Analytical results will also be completed at this time.

Now I am starting to share some of Roy's discomfort.

Not only does this call into question the objectivity of such contracted

As a separate item to the concerns I had about the technical content, I was
a little confused on what was done here administratively. The last paragraph
says something about NYPA sharing the study. I didn't think they had
anything at all to say about it in the first place if it is an ISO work
product. If they do, could you explain why this is the case? If the ISO did
this, why wasn't this all posted on the OASIS at the same time NYPA got
this? The date on this shows a March 26 release.  Ignore these comments if
this was done, but I wasn't aware of this.

I am more than a little uncomfortable with a single market participant
having a month's lead time on ISO studies that can have significant
commercial impact. Think about the implications of this in the context of
people negotiating long term bi lateral ICAP agreements over the last month.
Depending on your take on the type of market changes that this type of
analysis might support, there could be enormous changes to the economics of
seasonal versus annual agreements, choice of equipment etc. This simply
isn't fair. Even if posted, this type of work by the ISO that can have large
potential commercial impacts should go out on all of the distributions at
the same time as release to anyone and OASIS posting.

Subject: NYPA study-Winter Locational ICAP requirements

At NYPA's request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI,
respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter         requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that       having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

I would like to pay the NYISO to conduct a study for me on the price impact
of the transmission outages planned each day.  Since I would be paying for
this, I wouldof course be entitled to get the results one day in advance of
all other market participants.  The ISO would of course be free to release
the results to the rest of the marketplace just following the release of
the day ahead results each day.  This would ultimately be in the best
interests of the marketplace since I would immediately arbitrage the daily
market to the correct prices and thereby increase efficiency.  Upon review,
all would be amazed at just how efficient the marketplace has become based
upon how accurate it was at predicting settlement prices.

Content

On April 4, 2001, we issued a memorandum which included information from
EPA regarding the Agency=01,s current thinking on the draft MACT standards =
for
IC engines and combustion turbines located at major sources of HAP
emissions (see Attachment A of attached file).  Since the distribution of
that memorandum, EPA has provided corrections regarding the compliance
monitoring requirements for the IC Engine MACTs.  The MACT information
provided by EPA, including the latest corrections regarding compliance
monitoring are included in this memorandum.  Clearly, this is preliminary
information and should not be construed as the content of the final rules.
This content could change before these rules are submitted to OMB,
subsequently issued as proposed standards, or promulgated as final rules.

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the public web server (www.nyiso.com), MIS and
SPIDER that will be implemented on May, 01, 2001.
:

*  The software required to implement the Automated Mitigation
Process (AMP) will be deployed to the MIS and SPIDER systems. The
Automated Mitigation Process is the automation of existing market
mitigation procedures for the proactive mitigation of energy
suppliers who are about to exercise market power with a subsequent
price impact.  Activation of the software is pending.

*  A new version of the Moving Range Chart web application will be
deployed (Originally scheduled April 24th , 2001).

*  The process to generate all the files posted for real-time LBMP
data to the NYISO web site (OASIS) will be changed to use XML
technology in order create the files faster, neater and more
reliably. The files Market Participants use in the OASIS will not
change.  Previously a product called InfoReports was used to
generate those web postings.

Changes #: KKIR-4VQSTF; RMUY-4VPRUZ; VLEE-4VQPHQ; MDSO-4VPSM6

If you notice any NYISO systems behave other than intended after
the scheduled implementation date, please let us know immediately.

It will be helpful if you refer to this notice if you communicate
with us about these changes.

This raises concerns about what functions any ISO should take on in the
long run.  Here the ISO used its limited resources, ones which many members
want directed to specific high priority projects... such as virtual
bidding, to perform a study on ICAP that we did not know about until a
flurry of emails arrive.  The point is, the ISO better serves by focusing
its talent and limited time on facilitating the operation of a workable,
reliable, cost effective and efficient power market and by performing
studies consistent with member priorities.  Not by performing studies at
the request of one member, unless they are part of a clearly defined and
approved process like that for interconnections.  The ISO should work as a
""market facilitator,"" and as such expend its talents on providing accurate
and timely pricing, billing, and tracking of energy transactions within,
into, and out of New York.

The NYISO's need to periodically address market reliability issues and to
initiate studies should continue, in the near term.   Market participants
can raise concerns about reliability issues or submit studies they perform
to the ISO and if the ISO believes that they have merit, we can all review
and debate them and not be advantaged or disadvantaged by some activities
that the ISO decided to undertake with one member.  The ISO should not
pirate market participants' opportunities to analyze the dynamics of
generation availability, transmission, ICAP, and demand to discover areas
for investment.

What better stimulus than ROI is there to seek out opportunities and
eradicate inefficiencies in the market?  Let the market work, and the ISO
facilitate.

Dear Market Participants,

As many of you know, and as some of you have commented about, the
ISO performed additional computer analysis regarding locational ICAP
requirements at NYPA's request early this year.  We did so after
agreeing that the issue NYPA raised was relevant to our market and
would not detract from other work we were conducting.  The results
were shared with NYPA in March with the understanding that NYPA
would use the study results to promote a dialogue among Market
Participants on the issues raised.

The NYISO would like to formalize the process of contract work on
issues relevant to the New York market, or decide to discontinue it,
by reviewing with Market Participants a proposed protocol indicating
appropriate areas for study and appropriate disclosure guidelines.
We will request the Operating, Business Issues and Management
Committee Chairs to add this proposed protocol, for discussion, to
committee agendas for May.   We look forward to working with all
Market Participants on reaching agreement on an acceptable process
that is both useful and fair to everyone.

Regards,

Mollie Lampi,
NYISO Senior Attorney

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Chuck, please see that this gets on the appropriate distributions lists, TIE
and BIC.

In thinking over the discussions at the BIC meeting I found two areas
related to interactions with PJM where I am a bit confused due to what is
either my misunderstanding, or conflicting information provided by NY and
PJM. I would appreciate it if the NYISO would clarify these items. I will
also make a similar request of PJM.

1) Common interface tool.

My understand from the PJM EMC meeting was that PJM was going basically do
this entirely (or almost entirely) on their own, and just allocate some
costs between NY and PJM. The product as I understood it would be available
to participants of both pools for transactions scheduling. The users would
input to the tool, and NY and PJM would basically get screened/coordinated
input simultaneously in order to accelerate scheduling and minimize checkout
problems etc.

If this was the case, I don't understand the comments at the BIC that NY
wont be able to do this by the summer. Is this a PJM or NY constraint? Is
PJM unable to complete what they offered? I can understand that that would
hold things up as they proposed to do most of the work. However at the PJM
EMC I got the impression that PJM was all set to go, could make the
schedule, and just needed NY agreement. If this is a NY constraint I would
also like to know more about it.

Can you please clarify what is going on here?

2) Inter ISO Congestion Pilot. I was disappointed in the ""lukewarm""
presentation that Rick Gonzales made at the BIC. I realize that this program
is very limited in scope, but it seems to me this is a very important
precedent to the future coordination of the ISO's. As we left things it
seems likely that this will die in committee before the summer.

However, I would like a technical explanation of one of things that Rick
said. He commented that one of his discomforts related to a request by PJM
that NY pay for some generation in Northern New Jersey. At first blush this
got a very negative response in the group.

Then I started to think about this more. My understanding is the basic
structure of the agreement is that ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B
is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in A.  Thus if
PJM was suggesting NY pay for North Jersey generation, presumably this was
to be for PJM adding generation there to ease a NY constraint. Now I am not
a great electrical engineer, but my limited understanding of the systems
suggests to me that if PJM is adding generation in North Jersey to help NY,
this has to do with modification to the PAR flows and support of SENY
through the PSEG cable. Is this correct?

IF CORRECT, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE NYISO HAS REJECTED A PROPOSAL TO
INCREASE SUPPLIES TO SENY FOR THIS SUMMER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR
REDISPATCH IN PJM?

I hope that this is an incorrect conclusion, otherwise we have some big
problems.

I would appreciate a further explanation of this, as perhaps I don't
understand what is physically happening.

Thanks for the help

Roy,

Thanks for sharing your concerns regarding the MOU pilot programs.  I will
include below a portion of the draft minutes from the April 18th NYISO
Management Committee meeting which discuss the NYISO position on the CIT
project.  Initially, this project was viewed as a ""quick hit"" which could be
completed swiftly, at minimal cost, and with minimal impact on staff and 
ongoing
project work.  Further discussion with PJM reveals that this will not be the
case.

Question on CIT/CSS:

In thinking over the discussions at the BIC meeting I found two areas
related to interactions with PJM where I am a bit confused due to what is
either my misunderstanding, or conflicting information provided by NY and
PJM. I would appreciate it if the NYISO would clarify these items. I will
also make a similar request of PJM.

1) Common interface tool.

My understand from the PJM EMC meeting was that PJM was going basically do
this entirely (or almost entirely) on their own, and just allocate some
costs between NY and PJM. The product as I understood it would be available
to participants of both pools for transactions scheduling. The users would
input to the tool, and NY and PJM would basically get screened/coordinated
input simultaneously in order to accelerate scheduling and minimize checkout
problems etc.

If this was the case, I don't understand the comments at the BIC that NY
wont be able to do this by the summer. Is this a PJM or NY constraint? Is
PJM unable to complete what they offered? I can understand that that would
hold things up as they proposed to do most of the work. However at the PJM
EMC I got the impression that PJM was all set to go, could make the
schedule, and just needed NY agreement. If this is a NY constraint I would
also like to know more about it.

Can you please clarify what is going on here?

Response:

(Reported by Mr. Museler to the MC on 4-18-2001)

1.   There have been recent developments in the NYISO / PJM CIT process.  At 
the
present time, no software requirements document has been created, no vendor
contracts have been signed,  and a number of issues, including ensuring the
confidentiality of data, providing redundancy in New York in case the PJM 
based
system fails, and liability, all have to be resolved.

When the project was originally proposed, the NYISO believed it could be done
quickly with a limited amount of resources.  This has not proven to be the 
case.
Completing this project immediately  would take resources away from other
projects need for Summer 2001 and will have a budget impact of approximately 
$1
million.  The NYISO does not believe it would be prudent to allow this project
to come ahead of the Summer 2001 issues, or to proceed without vendor 
contracts
in place and other outstanding issues resolved.  The NYISO will continue work 
on
the CIT process and will keep the Committees informed of developments.

Question:

2) Inter ISO Congestion Pilot. I was disappointed in the ""lukewarm""
presentation that Rick Gonzales made at the BIC. I realize that this program
is very limited in scope, but it seems to me this is a very important
precedent to the future coordination of the ISO's. As we left things it
seems likely that this will die in committee before the summer.

However, I would like a technical explanation of one of things that Rick
said. He commented that one of his discomforts related to a request by PJM
that NY pay for some generation in Northern New Jersey. At first blush this
got a very negative response in the group.

Then I started to think about this more. My understanding is the basic
structure of the agreement is that ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B
is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in A.  Thus if
PJM was suggesting NY pay for North Jersey generation, presumably this was
to be for PJM adding generation there to ease a NY constraint. Now I am not
a great electrical engineer, but my limited understanding of the systems
suggests to me that if PJM is adding generation in North Jersey to help NY,
this has to do with modification to the PAR flows and support of SENY
through the PSEG cable. Is this correct?

IF CORRECT, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE NYISO HAS REJECTED A PROPOSAL TO
INCREASE SUPPLIES TO SENY FOR THIS SUMMER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR
REDISPATCH IN PJM?

I hope that this is an incorrect conclusion, otherwise we have some big
problems.

I would appreciate a further explanation of this, as perhaps I don't
understand what is physically happening.

Thanks for the help

Response:

With regard to the inter-ISO Congestion management pilot, Rick Gonzales offers
the following response to your comments:

2. Please be advised that the NYISO fully supports the Inter-regional 
Congestion
Pilot program. The Congestion Pilot will be presented again for comment at the
Market Structures WG for further discussion and to facilitate the potential
implementation of this program.

One of the major issues noted in the presentation that limits the extent to
which the Pilot program can be used is the potential for cost-shifting between
ISOs. In addition to providing a list of 'candidate' operational constraints, 
it
was also noted that it is the responsibility of each ISO to re-dispatch its
internal control area resources to solve its own internal constraints. This
concept is in agreement with your understanding that 'ISO A only makes 
payments
to ISO B if B is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in
A'.

Any futher conclusions that one might imply from the Inter-regional Congestion
Pilot should be discussed at the next Market Structures WG meeting.

C. King adds the following with regard to the notion of increasing supplies to
SENY and the operation of the PARs (Waldwick & Linden-Goethals/Hudson 
faragut):

Since the initiation of the NYISO Markets, the full capability of the
Hudson-Farragut PARs has not been available due to equipment failure.  The
equipment is expected to be back in service on or about the May-June period.  
In
preparation for the return of the outaged PAR to service, NYISO and PJM staff
have been discussing the operation of the PARs and the relationship of the PAR
schedules to the PSEG-Con Edison Energy Transfer Agreements which have long 
been
associated with this equipment.  It would be pre-mature to establish a
congestion-management pilot involving facilities in the electrical vicinity of
the PARs, until the operating procedures related to the operation of the PARs 
is
fully discussed and agreed to.
Both PJM & NYISO acknowledged this at the Stakeholder Meeting in Toronto 
earlier
this year, so this is nothing new.

Presently the equipment owners (PSEG & Con Edison) as well as NYISO and PJM 
are
engaged in discussions which should ultimately result in an operating 
agreement
between PJM and NYISO regarding the operation and scheduling of the PARs.
Progress is being made, thus I think that every effort is being made to insure
that energy can flow between PJM and SENY, and between NY and New Jersey for
this summer and beyond.  We appreciate your encouragement of these efforts and
other efforts to address seams issues in the northeast.

See you in Springfield next Wednesday!

Chuck

As a margin account holder, you know how important it is to receive 
information about your account in a quick and timely manner. One of 
the ways we notify customers about a margin call is with a letter, but 
unfortunately that letter often arrives too late for timely action. 
That's why we've decided to stop sending regular mail notification of 
margin calls to our customers. 

E-mail is the fastest way for us to notify you about a margin call. We 
will continue to provide you with speedy e-mail notification, and are 
committed to steadily improving our already top-rated e-mail service. 
Please check your inbox regularly and make sure that the e-mail 
address we have on file for your account is current. 

To update your e-mail address online, simply login to your account and 
select ""Settings"" from the Account Services pull-down menu. Then click 
""User Profile"" and follow the directions to modify your e-mail address. 

We'd like to remind you of your responsibility to remain aware of the 
status of your margin account at all times, and to be prepared to take 
action as soon as conditions warrant. Be fully aware that if at any 
time your account value falls to approximately 10% equity, or if 
market conditions warrant, we reserve the right to close out some or 
all of your positions with or without notice, at our sole discretion. 
For these reasons it is imperative that you monitor your account on a 
regular basis.

Here are some suggestions:

1.  Exclude the remediation system equipment: 350 bbl AST and equipment 
building with air compressor.
2.  We will need unrestricted access 24 hrs/day, 7 days/week to monitor and 
service the remediation system and monitor wells.
3.  The electric power drop for the remediation equipment is separate from 
the facility so this shouldn't be a problem.
4.  The remediation system does not utilize compressed air or natural gas 
from the facility so this shouldn't be a problem.
5.  Reserve the right to deed record the location of contaminated soil and 
groundwater.
6.  Reserve the right to construct additional wells and/or facilities to 
faciliate remediation efforts.
7.  Reserve the right to irrigate recovered groundwater on-site.

*  A new internal application for Operations to manage units
placed out of merit will improve coordination between Operations
and Grid Accounting for the purposes of accurate billing.

caused some visible changes in the MIS web pages
that were not explained in the original notice.

The screens which have changed are:

- Gen Bid Query Page - New value of 'MODIFIED' in the Bid Status
dropdown.  This will allow a user to select only bids that have a
status of 'MODIFIED'.

- Gen Bid Query Results Page - The status for a particular bid may
have a value of 'MODIFIED'.  Clicking on the bid status link will
list a message page with more information about the meaning of the
status.

- Gen Bid Page - The schedule information at the bottom of the page
may list a bid status of 'MODIFIED'.

- Gen Outage Page - Once fixed, the outage information will be
listed on an hourly basis since the outage information is now tied
to the bids.

- For the upload/download, the templates for submission and results
have not changed.  Retrieval of generator bids may have some
records with a bid status of 'MODIFIED', along with a message tied
to the meaning of the status.  The outage schedule information
(once fixed) will have the information listed on an hourly basis.

All of these screens have not changed in terms of layout or

of the query parameters and query results.

2000 during a meeting with PG&E at TW's Flagstaff Compressor Station.  One of 
the critical issues that came out of this effort was finding out from PG&E 
that they need TW's deliveries to blend into the richer gas that they are 
receiving from El Paso and Kern River so they can meet their air permit 
emission limits on VOC's.  If they do not have TW's deliveries (dry gas) for 
the blending they will not be able to maintain compliance in some

			How 'Bout Some Tonic With That Gin?
			The game of Gin was Hollywood's game. When it stormed through that town in 
the '40s, you could see Gin being played on the silver screen by all types of 
movie stars. Refined in the early 1900s at the Knickerbocker Whist Club in 
New York, Gin is the perfect social card game. It's not so strategic as to 
preclude chatting, but it still provides real competitive kick and a gleeful 
way to gloat when the cards are laid down, and ""Gin"" is scored. Not every 
online gaming site has Gin. But it's taking off on PlaySite. Take a break 
from your day and try it!

			Tournament Time
			What better way to test your gaming skills than to compete in an online 
tournament with other top-ranked competitors? PlaySite offers automatically 
scheduled tournaments in seven games: Backgammon, Checkers, Chess, Go-Moku, 
Hex, Mancala and Reversi. Some games have tournaments geared for the 
beginning player. Backgammon has tournaments for those rated Under 1500 and 
an Open class. Checkers and Chess both have tournaments for those rated Under 
1300 and a separate Open class. 
			
			Playing in a tournament is easy and fun. Go to your favorite game page, and 
click to enter the tournament room. You'll see areas for tournament info, 
signups, games, a history of prior tournaments and a schedule for upcoming 
tournaments. PlaySite tourneys run throughout the day. Get a complete look at

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO has chosen $150 as representative of a level to trigger market
mitigation. I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price
that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of $50.
A 300% increase or an increase of $100 is $150, coincidently the same
price.

I am questioning the determination of this price ($50) and its
application in the market mitigation plan.

In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan
specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic
withholding. How does the $50 price reference a specific unit, I am not
sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire
statewide price and then compare it to a generator's bid.

If a generator's fuel costs (without fixed cost recovery) is $150 that
unit would presumably never bid below its cost, it would always bid as a
minimum $150. How could that generator exceed the thresholds identified
in the market mitigation plan. A 300% increase would be $450 and an
increase of $100 would be $250, and yet using the AMP interpretation of
the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding
is $150.
It would seem that the AMP methodology is improperly applying the Market
Mitigation Plan. The Mitigation Plan is supposed to identify generator
conduct and clearly in the application of the AMP it is not.

The simple question would be is the $150 threshold representative of
every generator's bid to determine economic withholding. The answer can
only be no, how can it be?

The Market Mitigation Plan was intended to determine whether a generator
was exercising market power. The determination of whether a generator
was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all
of the prevalent market, unit and system conditions to determine if that
unit was in fact exercising market power. The more complex the system
the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised.

How does a price trigger (or any automatic threshold) take all of the
complexities of a situation into account? It cannot, I suspect that is
why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power
determination. The full facts are presented and evaluated, every case is
unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact.
In other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the
NYISO AMP it is offered as a solution.


I do agree that prices should not be posted in the DAM if they are high
as a result of market power. A better solution would be to delay the
prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made. In
the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they
should be held in reserve for determination of market power. Prices can
be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power,
at least then due process can be followed. Market participants can be
consulted in accordance with the Plan and if required SCUC can be rerun.

External proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are
consistent with the orginal DAM posting if a longer period of time is
required for market power evaluation. The AMP is still in place but is
only used to identify potential market power until a ""human"" evaluation
is done.

Discussion List:

Your discussion is based on a misunderstanding.  The $150 price is the
lowest point at which the AMP will check for whether there needs to be any
mitigation.  This price was picked to avoid the AMP running when it is
highly unlikely that any mitigation will in fact be needed.

The $150 price will not trigger mitigation in and of its.  Whenever one of
the zones has a price that is above $150 the AMP will run to determine if
any units have crossed the conduct threshold.  If there are any units that
have crossed the conduct threshold then those units will be set at their
reference bids and the market will be rerun to determine if the impact
threshold has been triggered.  If the impact threshold is triggered in any
zone then the final runs will be done with the mitigated (i.e. reference)
bids for those units that triggered the conduct threshold.  If the impact
threshold is not triggered then the original bids for all units will be
used.

How does a price trigger (or any automatic threshold) take all of the
complexities of a situation into account? It cannot, I suspect that is
why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power
determination. The full facts are presented and evaluated, every case is
unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact.
In other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the
NYISO AMP it is offered as a solution.


I do agree that prices should not be posted in the DAM if they are high
as a result of market power. A better solution would be to delay the
prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made. In
the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they
should be held in reserve for determination of market power. Prices can
be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power,
at least then due process can be followed. Market participants can be
consulted in accordance with the Plan and if required SCUC can be rerun.

External proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are
consistent with the orginal DAM posting if a longer period of time is
required for market power evaluation. The AMP is still in place but is
only used to identify potential market power until a ""human"" evaluation
is done.

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Mark

Thanks for the clarification, regardless of what triggers mitigation it
is still an automated process that bypasses due process. System, unit
and market conditions are dynamic and therefore the circumstances to
determine market power are dynamic, you would assume that they are
fixed. Reference prices are dynamic based on many of the complexities of
the system. As a simple example I would offer gas basis as a complexity
that is not even taken into consideration.
Gas basis can have the result of increasing costs to a generator by as
an example $20/MMbtu, who at the NYISO is monitoring this on an hourly
basis?

If the most expensive unit on the system is given a reference price of
$150 what would be the highest clearing price you would expect to see
that would be set by an internal generator?

Since the NYISO reference bids for generators involved approximately
zero discussion with generators would you consider that following the
Market Mitigation Plan?

The default reference price for a generator's energy is based on
recently accepted bids for energy from that generator. In the event that
such data are unavailable a default reference price is either(1) by
negotiation with the generator, or (2) by an estimate of cost.

What defines an accepted bid? Is it the dispatch of a generator with
payment being either its bid or the LBMP price at the bus whichever is
higher. This is not clear to me.
What happened to the negotiation part?

In training material provided by the NYISO they clarify that a generator
must include all of its costs in its bid to ensure cost recovery, part
of those costs are fixed cost recovery. None of the default reference
bids assigned by the NYISO include any these costs.


Thanks

Joe

Your discussion is based on a misunderstanding.  The $150 price is the
lowest point at which the AMP will check for whether there needs to be
any
mitigation.  This price was picked to avoid the AMP running when it is
highly unlikely that any mitigation will in fact be needed.

The $150 price will not trigger mitigation in and of its.  Whenever one
of
the zones has a price that is above $150 the AMP will run to determine
if
any units have crossed the conduct threshold.  If there are any units
that
have crossed the conduct threshold then those units will be set at their
reference bids and the market will be rerun to determine if the impact
threshold has been triggered.  If the impact threshold is triggered in
any
zone then the final runs will be done with the mitigated (i.e.
reference)
bids for those units that triggered the conduct threshold.  If the
impact
threshold is not triggered then the original bids for all units will be
used.

""Kirkpatrick, Joe"" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO has chosen $150 as representative of a level to trigger market
mitigation. I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price
that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of $50.
A 300% increase or an increase of $100 is $150, coincidently the same
price.

I am questioning the determination of this price ($50) and its
application in the market mitigation plan.

In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan
specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic
withholding. How does the $50 price reference a specific unit, I am not
sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire
statewide price and then compare it to a generator's bid.

If a generator's fuel costs (without fixed cost recovery) is $150 that
unit would presumably never bid below its cost, it would always bid as a
minimum $150. How could that generator exceed the thresholds identified
in the market mitigation plan. A 300% increase would be $450 and an
increase of $100 would be $250, and yet using the AMP interpretation of
the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding
is $150.
It would seem that the AMP methodology is improperly applying the Market
Mitigation Plan. The Mitigation Plan is supposed to identify generator
conduct and clearly in the application of the AMP it is not.

The simple question would be is the $150 threshold representative of
every generator's bid to determine economic withholding. The answer can
only be no, how can it be?

The Market Mitigation Plan was intended to determine whether a generator
was exercising market power. The determination of whether a generator
was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all
of the prevalent market, unit and system conditions to determine if that
unit was in fact exercising market power. The more complex the system
the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised.

How does a price trigger (or any automatic threshold) take all of the
complexities of a situation into account? It cannot, I suspect that is
why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power

Kayne,

I've noticed some confusion lately on which CP name to use in EnPower for 
Ameren transmission - Ameren Services Company (ASC) is the right one.  If you 
could pass this along I would appreciate it.

Subject:  Cancellation of May 1, 2001 BS&P call on credit policy

We previously agreed to hold a conference call meeting May 1 in
anticipation of having sufficient progress from the Credit Policy Working
Group (CPWG) to review.  After speaking with Andy Ragogna this afternoon, I
do not believe the CPWG is close enough to a detailed proposal to have a
productive conference, after all.  Consequently, I am canceling the May 1 
call.

Additionally, it appears unlikely at this point we will have a proposal
ready for the May 10 Management Committee  meeting. My report will simply
be a progress report on the Credit Policy issue, and a report on our plans
to develop this year's budget and goals recommendations.

I think the previous numbers are a bit low now. In December, 1999, we 
installed four downgradient monitor wells on off-site property owned by the 
Nature Conservancy. Samples from these wells confirm a contaminant plume of 
arsenic in the shallow groundwater emanating from the release area. Another 
development is the recent accumulation of product in some of our recovery 
wells that is different in characteristic from what we were previously 
dealing with. This indicates that we are possibly pulling in product from 
another source that we have not yet identified (although I suspect a nearby 
sump location as the culprit). We have another drilling program in the works 
for this year to further delineate the downgradient extent of the arsenic 
plume and to evaluate the other potential source of accumulated product. This 
work is tentatively scheduled for the latter part of August or September. 
Please let me know if this schedule should be accelerated or deferred due to 
a pending sale agreement. Another consideration related to off-site 
contamination, the Railroad Commission has not yet requested that NNG notify 
affected property owners, but I suspect that such a request is forthcoming. I 
am in the process of preparing a letter, addressed to you, identifying the 
affected property located between the facility and the Nature Conservancy 
property. 

In light of these considerations and the continued interest by the Railroad 
Commission, I have adjusted the spending forecast as follows:
2000    $100k
2001    $100k
2002    $60k
2003    $20k
2004    $20k
2005+  $20k
Total   $320,000+
Notes regarding this forecast:
1) This should be viewed as an optimistic forecast (i.e., if everything goes 
fairly well).
2) No $ are included in this forecast for managing off-site property issues 
that may arise.
3) Assumes that a second source area is confirmed and additional recovery 
wells will be installed next year to recover PSH from this area. 
4) Assumes that the existing recovery system will be adequate for continued 
operations.
5) Assumes that the recovery system continues to operate through 2002.
6) Assumes that the Railroad Commission will continue to renew the minor 
permit for disposal of recovered liquids.
7) Assumes that quarterly groundwater sampling will continue at least through 
2005.

Steve, after talking to Lou, we have a couple of choices:  (1) you could tell 
them that they have to assume the groundwater problem (based on the value of 
the property, do you think they priced it into their offer?), (2) we can 
specifically retain the groundwater issue as we previously discussed or (3) 
we can remain silent on the issue and assume that they will include it in 
their environmental compliance report ( the only problem with this choice is 
that they have a termination right if title defects plus environmental 
compliance issues exceed 5.0% of the purchase price - basically this would 
give them a free out since this is probably a $250,000 problem that they 
already know about).   The attached draft assumes you will choose (2) since 
that is what we have been discussing all along.  

Please call me if you have any questions.  As I mentioned on your voicemail, 
I have an appointment out of the office in the morning and may or may not 
work out of the house after that.   Regardless, I will have the document with 
me and can talk it over with you or make changes as you see appropriate.  My 
number at home is 713-664-7472.

Subject: Transmission Rates

Hey guys,

I've updated the transmission rates table for May - here is the location:

M:\Electric\East Volume Mgmt\Transmission\Transmission Rates

If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me 
know and I can put a copy of it whereever.

Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...

First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the 
counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric 
Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has 
not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49

Please pass this along to the rest of the group, if any of you have any 
questions or suggestions - don't hesitate to call.

Thanks,
Michael

We completed the decontamination on both of the filter separators on the 
discharge of the Solexol Plant.  There was a thin film of an oily substance 
(presumably Solexol) on the interior wall of the filter separators.  However, 
both sets of filters were very clean.  No moisture was present on the filters 
and there was not any sludge or build up on any of the filters.  The filters 
that were removed had the same appearance of a brand new filter.  As a matter 
or fact, when you laid a new filter beside a used filter you could not tell a 
difference.  The filters being used are a Sock type filter and when you ran 
your hand across the filters you could not detect the presence of any 
moisture at all.

So, it's presumed that the system has been completely absent of any liquid.  
The small amounts of liquid being collected from week to week for sampling 
must have been accumulated from the run down or film, pre-existing on the 
interior of the filter separator housing.  A decontamination and triple rinse 
of each filter separator should result in a total absence of any liquid for 
future samples, other than the remaining soap and water used for the final 
rinse that could not be drained from the vessels.

Rich and I visited the Topock compressor station this morning and reviewed 
the sampling point on PG&E's inlet scrubber.  Rich made the recommendation to 
Randy Williams and Rick Bezanson (PG&E) that future samples be taken straight 
off the bottom of the scrubber rather than from PG&E's 1000 gallon blow down 
tank.  The purpose of this was to reduce the exposure to contaminating future 
samples with pre-existing PCB's that may have collected in the 1000 gallon 
blow down tank over a period of time.  PG&E agreed to sample from this point 
on future collections.

Both of the discharge lines on each filter separator at the Solexol plant 
have been hot tapped in preparation of Solexol injection.  Piping has been 
installed and pumps are in place to accommodate the Solexol injection as 
well.  However, NO injection of Solexol will take place until after our 
meeting next Tuesday with PG&E.

Transwestern has agreed with PG&E today to postpone our planned 
decontamination of the filter separator at Transwesterns PG&E meter station 
until April 28th, at which time Transwestern and PG&E will perform a 
decontamination of both TW's and PG&E's filter separators simultaneously.

Subject: PG&E UPDATE

Mike
We completed decontamination of the inlet filter at the selexol plant today. 
It was dirty but 
no liquid. There was some dried sludge in the bottom of the vessel and the 
filters were 
extremely dirty. We plan to do both of the filters on the discharge side 
tomorrow.I got a phone 
messsage from Jeff and he hasn't heard anything from PGE since the letter was 
sent . We will 
plan to bypass and clean the filter on the west side of the river, last one 
on our system Saturday
unless we hear something different tomorrow. We will notify the PGE operators 
of their plant 
tomorrow of our plans.If anyone needs to contact me my pager number is 
1-800-921-9564 and office
phone number is 505-260-4003. Leave a message on the office phone and it will 
automatically
page me. I'll give everyone an update late tomorrow. We should have the hot 
tap valves on location 
tomorrow for the selexol injection. We plan to install the valves as soon as 
they arrive.

Thanks RJ

By the way Bisti came on line today and they plan to run it tonight and be 
back on location to 
check on the unit tomorrow.

43838,campbell-l/all_documents/160.,<25878697.1075851881263.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"The Texas RailRoad Commission (TRC)  has sent a guideline for cleanup of 
condensate spills to its District Offices for implementation on July 1, 
2000.  Attached is the guideline which is titled,  

Field Guide for the Assessment and Cleanup of Soil and Groundwater 
Contaminated with Condensate From a Spill Incident (Statewide Rules 8, 20, 
and 91)

The introduction to the guideline states that it establishes bench marks and 
protocols that, when met and followed, will demonstrate that condensate 
spills have been addressed in a manner that complies with Statewide Rules 8, 
20, and 91.

Some comments related to this guideline from an industry association meeting 
in mid-July are listed below:

There appeared to be a wide variation in response of the districts to this 
guideline.

The TRC is receiving landowner compliants.  The TRC has gone out and found 
spills not cleaned up, where closure reports have been submitted.  

Parts of the guideline are not clear and the groundwater classification is 
not consistent with TRRP.  A revised guideline might be issued by TRC.

This condensate guideline is temporary until RBCA guidelines are available.  
TRC is working on a software model projected by the end of this year.

Also attached is another guideline that the TRC issued at the same time, 
which is titled:

Field Guide for Reportable Surface Releases of Crude Oil in Non-sensitive 
Areas (Statewide Rules 8, 20, and 91).

In a somewhat related item, the General Land Office on June 23, 2000 issued 
revised penalty guidelines (attached) effective August 1st for oil spills in 
Texas coastal waters.  Spills of less than a gallon will have fines of $250.  
The fines for larger spills will depend on factors such as the size of the 
spills, the number of unauthorized discharges in the past twelve-month 
period, and whether a Sound Management Practice or like program is in place.

Can someone shed any light on how much generation was on May 1 out of
merit?  I thought all such requests, whether by the Transmission
Provider or the ISO, were to be posted on the Dispatcher Notices.  There
were no notices posted between 04:03:58 and 21:50:53.  In that time
period I had gas turbines requested on by the ISO out of merit for 7
hours.  Was this done on a larger scale or was this an isolated
incident?",Non Abusive

the positives and negatives.  The positives being the information which Steve 
and company will collect.  This appears to be a  very useful tool.  There is 
also is no permit emission limits associated with the permit at this 
facility.  There also exists the potential to pay lower emissions fees should 
this investigation show that the emissions from the units to be significantly 
lower than what was placed into the permit application.  The downside to this 
effort is that the data we collect may in fact show that our emissions fees 
which we have been paying actually under estimate those submitted in our 
application and we would more than likely be held accountable for the 
difference (1996 to the present).  Additionally, enforcement action could 
result by the Navajos.  I say this to apprise everyone of the positive and 
negative potentials involved in completing this study.  From the emission 
estimates which were placed into the permit application we included a 
defendable buffer or excess of emissions to account for variations in the 
temperature, humidity, engine age and poor engine mechanics should they 
exist.  

And finally, we have the unknown of not knowing what the three units actually 
emit.  These units have never been tested.  This uncertanty in itself may be 
the driver to know so as not to have a situation which was similar to what 
happened at Atoka No. 3 several months ago.

Pollution Rules Tighten Squeeze on Power Supply 


By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer 


???? SACRAMENTO--California's already severe electricity squeeze could 
tighten further this summer if regulators don't ease up on air pollution 
rules, power company officials said Friday. 
???? The state's 1,000 power plants--many aging and burning natural 
gas--have been running so hard and long in this summer of electricity 
scarcity that many are close to spewing as much pollution as they are 
allowed for the year under their permits. 
???? Without flexibility from air pollution regulators, the plants could 
be forced to shut down or face fines. This summer California cannot 
afford the loss of any of those plants at times of peak demand, said the 
state's last-resort buyer of electricity. 
???? ""I can't tell you whether we are in big trouble or medium trouble,"" 
said Terry Winter, who oversees the nonprofit agency that buys 
last-minute supplies when electricity consumption spikes so high that it 
threatens to disrupt the state's high-voltage grid. 
???? ""If it stays really hot and we've got to run every unit,"" said 
Winter, ""then we've got a problem. If it cools off a little bit, we 
could turn off those units exceeding their permits and we won't have a 
problem at all. My sense is, by late August we'll be seeing the problem 
more severely. But we're working on it."" 
???? Local and state air pollution regulators say they recognize the 
problem and will do their best to help avoid outages. 
???? ""I was flying by the seat of my pants,"" said Richard Baldwin, head 
of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, who hurriedly 
struck a deal last week to keep a gas-fired turbine running on the 
Ventura County coast. The plant, which would have otherwise been shut 
down for the rest of the year because of air pollution rules, is owned 
by Houston-based Reliant Energy, one of the major players in 
California's recently deregulated electricity market. 
???? Under the deal, Reliant will pay the air district $4,000 for every 
hour it runs the relatively dirty plant the rest of the year. The money 
will go toward replacement of heavily polluting diesel engines. 
???? The agreement means that California's grid operators can now count 
on the plant to produce enough electricity to supply 125,000 homes. On a 
hot day in late July they desperately needed that electricity, but could 
not get it because Reliant's air pollution permit allowed 100 hours of 
operation each year and only five remained. 
???? ""Those air quality districts could just throw up their hands and 
say no, not our problem,"" said Winter, executive director of the 
California Independent System Operator, the nonprofit entity that runs 
most of California's electric grid, ""but they have all been very 
responsive."" 
???? He said his Folsom-based staff foresaw the problem and has been 
talking with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California 
Air Resources Board and the local air districts that set pollution 
limits for individual power plants. 
???? ""They have been very, very cooperative in trying to figure out ways 
to allow us to continue to generate but at the same time not add more 
pollutants to the air,"" he said. One way to do that, Winter said, may be 
to not run power plants in the evenings, when demand dips. 
???? ""We don't want to put the lights out in the state,"" said Bill 
Kelly, spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
which issued a letter to power producers two weeks ago warning that many 
will soon bump against their air pollution limits. 
???? ""We asked them, if they're going to be above their caps, to come in 
and work with us on compliance plans,"" Kelly said. ""These plans would be 
developed through public hearings."" 
???? What can be done will vary with every plant in the state, said V. 
John White, who sits on the Cal-ISO board and directs the Center for 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies in Sacramento. 
???? Air quality will not suffer significantly, White said, ""with some 
creative application of rules and the principle that you've got to pay 
for the pollution somehow."" 
???? The root of the current conflict between air pollution and energy 
production lies with California's failure in the last 10 years to build 
any major power plants. Demand for electricity in the state's humming 
economy has soared higher than anyone anticipated, while new supplies 
are not expected to reach the grid for at least a year. 
???? Several times this summer, grid operators have had to frantically 
purchase electricity elsewhere in the West to save the state from 
outages that can endanger lives and cost high-tech companies as much as 
$30 million a day in lost production. 
???? The shortage of electricity compromises air quality. When 
businesses voluntarily disconnect from the grid at times of highest 
demand, they often turn on diesel generators to maintain computer and 
phone systems. Such generators spew toxic air contaminants, particulates 
and higher levels of nitrogen oxides than most power plants. 
???? The tight supplies this summer also mean that California's old, 
inefficient power plants are running harder than ever and those built 
just for backup are running steadily. 
???? Duke Energy's power plant in Oakland helped keep lights on in the 
city after a disastrous 1989 earthquake. Typically, the costly plant 
operated 30 to 50 hours a year; its air pollution permit allows no more 
than 870 hours annually. So far this year, said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams, the plant has run more than 500 hours. 
???? ""The turbines date to late 1970s,"" he said. ""They're being called 
on more and more."" 
???? North Carolina-based Duke purchased or leased several major power 
plants from utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego 
Gas & Electric after the Legislature deregulated the state's electricity 
market in 1996. 
???? One plant, in Chula Vista, generates enough electricity for 700,000 
homes in San Diego, where transmission problems leave the city 
especially vulnerable to power sags and surges. 
???? That plant is rapidly approaching its limit on nitrogen oxide 
pollutants, Williams said. ""We're evaluating our options about how to 
address this problem.""

EMERALD: MAY BIRTHSTONE
==============================
Emerald is a green variety of the mineral beryl.  One of the
rarest members of the beryl family-only the red variety
(sometimes called ""red emerald"") is rarer-it is one of the most
highly prized of all the gems.  Aside from being the birthstone
for May, it was historically believed to bestow on its wearer
faithfulness and unchanging love, and was thought to enable
the wearer to forecast events.

The highest-quality emerald has the color of fresh young green
grass-an almost pure spectral green, possibly with a very faint
tint of blue, as in the finest emerald from Columbia, which is
considered by connoisseurs to be the world's finest.  Other
sources include Brazil, Zambia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia
and India.  Flawless emeralds are rare, so their ""flaws"" have
come to serve almost as ""fingerprints,"" while flawless
emeralds are immediately suspect.  Although a hard stone,
emerald will chip easily since it tends to be somewhat brittle,
so special care should be given in wearing and handling.

Techniques to enhance color and reduce the visibility of flaws
are also frequently used.  A common practice is to fill
surface-reaching cracks with oil (sometimes tinted green), a
practice that goes back to early Greek times.  Today's
emeralds are oiled using a vacuum/heat technology.  This is a
widely accepted trade practice, since it is actually good for
the stone in light of its fragile nature.  Oiling hides some
of the whitish flaws, which are actually cracks, filling the
cracks so they become less visible.  The oil becomes an
integral part of the emerald unless it is subjected to some
type of degreasing procedure.  The development and use of
the ultrasonic cleaner has brought to light the extensive-
ness of this practice.  Never clean emeralds in an
ultrasonic cleaner.

While oiling is considered an acceptable practice, be sure
the price reflects the actual quality of the stone.  If
necessary, most emeralds can be ""re-oiled.""


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
=========================

Name:   Uncle Sam
Weight: 40.23 carats (rough) and 12.42 carats (cut)
Color:  M (very light brown)
Clarity:VVS1
Shape: Emerald Cut

The Uncle Sam diamond, which was discovered in the ""Crater
of diamonds"" in Arkansas in 1924, is the largest yet found
in the United States.  Peiken Jewelers of New York City,
owned the Uncle Sam for many years.  For a while, it was
on loan to the American Museum of Natural History.  In
1971, Sidney de Young, a dealer from Boston, bought the
diamond and then sold it to an unnamed collector.


SEA DIAMONDS
===========================================
An enterprising Texan called Sammy Collins drew worldwide
attention in 1962 when he announced that he'd recovered
50,000 carats of diamonds worth $1.5 million from the
seabed off the treacherous Diamond Coast of South West
Africa.  Collins figured that since diamonds had been
found in abundant amounts along the coast, most likely
carried there by the Vaal and Orange rivers from some
far inland deposit, they also ought to be found under
the ocean.

Over a period of three years, Collins used the equivalent
of huge vacuum sweepers to suck some 400,000 carats of
diamonds from the seabed.  His adventures set off a
mini-rush by others to try this new type of exploration
but terrible working conditions and uncertain diamond
deposits sent most into early obscurity.

Today, with improved technology, De Beers and others are
once again probing the waters of the South Atlantic,
bringing closer the prospect of viable undersea
diamond recovery.


LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL?
============================================
We will be attending the annual JCK Jewelry Show in Las Vegas
the first week of June.  This is your opportunity to get access

SI2 CLARITY
=========================
While we recommend at least SI1 clarity for most
diamonds to ensure they are ""eye clean,"" many consumers
think that SI2 means nothing visible with the naked eye.
The following comments define the official GIA position:

""SI stones contain noticeable inclusions which are easy
(SI1) or very easy (SI2) for a trained grader to see
under 10X. Typical inclusions are included crystals,
clouds, and feathers, normally centrally located and
noticed immediately. A stone with an eye visible
inclusion can still be graded SI. You must consider the
size, nature, position, number, and color or relief of
the inclusion. The size and shape of the stone are
important too. Characteristics in the SI1 grade usually
are not visible to the unaided eye face-up.
Characteristics in some SI2 stones can be seen with the
unaided eye.""

We find that over half of the SI2 stones have visible
inclusions to the naked eye. Note the above comments
say ""visible to the unaided eye face-up."" With most
shapes of diamonds, inclusions are often easily visible
from the side where there are few, if any, facets to
hide them. We just sent a VS1 clarity princess back to
the wholesaler because the inclusion, while not visible
face-up, was easily visible with the naked eye from the
side. You can imagine what the SI2 diamonds look like
from the side if they are visible face-up. If the
mounting hides the side of the diamond, these side
visible inclusions are not a problem. But most mountings
show off the side of a diamond and make them easy to see.

INSURANCE QUESTIONS
==============================
Most people do not realize that insurers differ widely in
what they offer regarding coverage and reimbursement or
replacement.  Many insurance companies will not reimburse
the ""full value"" provided in the policy but, rather,
exercise a ""replacement"" option--and will offer a sum in
cash less than the amount for which the jewelry is
insured, or offer to replace it for you.  Therefore it is
important to ask some very specific questions to determine
the precise coverage offered.  We recommend asking the
insurer at least the following:

1) How do you satisfy claims?  Do you reimburse the insured
amount in cash?  If not, how is the amount of the cash
settlement determined?  Or do you replace the jewelry?

2) What involvements do I have in the replacement of an
item?  What assurance do I have that the replacement will be
of comparable quality and value?

3) What is your coverage on articles that cannot be
replaced?

4) Exactly what risks does my policy cover--all risks?
Mysterious disappearance?  Am I covered in all geographic
areas?  At all times?

5) Are their any exemptions or exclusions?  What if the loss
involves negligence?  What happens if the diamond falls out?

6) What are the deductibles, if any?

7) What documentation do you expect me to provide?

Every week we hear yet another story of a customer who paid
insurance premiums for years and were shocked to discover
how little protection they really had when they did have a
claim.  Check the small print before you need it.


FOUR C'S
===========================
Diamond quality and value are determined by four factors.
These factors are called the ""Four C's.""  If we were to rank
them based on their importance in determining the value of a
diamond, we would list them as follows:

1) Color
2) Clarity
3) Cut and proportion
4) Carat weight

In terms of determining beauty, however, we would rank them
in a different order:

1) Cut and proportion
2) Color
3) Clarity
4) Carat weight

When diamond shopping, it pays to put your focus on cut and
proportion since this is where you get the most impact on
beauty while paying little premium in price.  We recommend
investing your dollars in beauty you see rather than rarity
and higher ""quality"" not visible to your eye.

BOW TIE
=======
One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning
in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie, or butterfly effect,
a darkened area across the center or widest part of the
stone, depending upon the cut.  The bow tie is commonly
seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any
fancy shape.  Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will
exhibit some minimal bow tie effect.  Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper
proportioning.  In poorly proportioned stones there is a
pronounced bow tie; the more pronounced, the poorer the
proportioning.  The less pronounced the bow tie, the better
the proportioning.  The degree to which the bow tie is
evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make (cut).


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:

networking devices. This is the first step in the routing integration. Since 
ENW is already static routing 10.0.0.0/8 to EBS and EBS is static routing 
172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16 to ENW, the impact should be nil.
Backout: Remove eigrp process 5 from iah-ecn44-rtr3.excelr.net

liquids collection SoCal wants to take at our Needles facility.  Ralph said 
that SoCal will be undertaking a study on their pipeline to determine why the 
concentration and liquids volume of PCB's has reduced into their system in 
the past couple of  years (97-2000). I shared with Ralph and up until this 
year, we have not had liquids at the Needles facility since 1994.  He stated 
that they have seen reduced concentrations and are curious as to why this 
trend is occurring (sounds like good news to me).  He said that their data 
shows the following:

 1998 liquids concentrations  only 1% regulated at the federal level

 1999 liquids concentrations only 8% regulated at the federal level

Ralph has requested that SoCal be allowed to collect a  liquids sample at the 
Needles M/S and I have contacted the Needles team about assisting SoCal with 
the collection.

I would expect that this may have implications with respect to slight 
increased billing for analytical charges that SoCal will be charging us for 
and we reveiw on a quarterly basis with them.",Non Abusive

Dear Larry,

Everyone has their own definition of paradise. For some it's 
unspoiled beaches and lush tropical jungle. For others it's a more 
developed resort. For others, it's not about the outdoors at all--if 
you're one of those people who thinks a place called ""Sin City"" 
sounds just about perfect, we can help you, too. However you like it, 
Travelocity can help make it happen. Whether you're traveling with 
your sweetie, or just into the romance of traveling, Travelocity can 
help you plan and book the perfect trip. And that sounds like 
paradise to us.

The island of Oahu just might be the perfect place for a romantic 
getaway. That's because if you and your other half can't agree on a 
vacation here, we're not sure you're ever going to agree on anything. 
She likes seclusion, and you like bustle? No problem. Lively Waikiki 
is complemented by dozens of other beaches on the island, some of 
which you'll have practically to yourselves. Or maybe he's a city 
person, and you crave nature? It's easy to please both on an island 
that boasts both crowded Honolulu and rugged 3,000-foot mountains--all 
within an area you can drive clear around in a matter of hours. 

Grupo Taca is Currently Offering Sale Fares to Costa Rica!
Costa Rica, with its unspoiled beaches and abundant wildlife, is 
pretty close to paradise on earth. It's not highly developed--don't 
expect five-star accommodations, at least not in every village. Do 
expect uncrowded, even empty stretches of sand, protected rainforest, 
and the best birdwatching of your life. If getting away from it all 
is your idea of the perfect vacation, Costa Rica is the place 
for you.

We will require off-site access for the installation of 10 remediation wells 
at the North Crawar facility (formerly owned by TW but now owned by Duke). I 
will drop off in your office a site diagram that indicates the location of 
the wells relative to the facility and the existing wells. I believe that the 
adjacent property owner had been contacted prior to well installations in 
August 1997, but I am not familiar with the details of the access agreement 
or even who within ET&S made the arrangements. We are shooting for 
early-October for the well installations. We may also want to address 
continued access to the wells in an agreement with the landowner (a 5-10 year 
term should be sufficient). Give me a call at x67327 if you have any

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Generators are supposed to be dispatched in the DAM in accordance with
their generator commitment parameters, many of these parameters are not
respected.
The minimum runtime is the one that is garnering the most attention, but
there is another parameter that would appear to be modeled incorrectly
which can have a significant impact on both the penalties applied to
generators and also on the issue of system security as it is applied to
system reserves.

Generators are loaded in the DAM in accordance with their loading rates,
the minimum loading rate for generators is 1% of their maximum rating. A
500 MW unit will have a loading rate of 5 MW/minute.

As an example of how SCUC loads generators I will use actual dispatch
data from Arthur Kill 2.

Arthur Kill 2 has a maximum rating of 359 MW and therefore has a loading
rate of 3.6 MW/minute.
The unit minimum is 90 MW and when dispatched from one hour to the next
should be constrained to what the unit can actually load.

We have received dispatches on our unit that would have the unit loaded
to 90 MW on average for one hour and then loaded to 241 MW for the next
hour. If the unit started loading at the end of the hour and loaded at
its loading rate of 3.6 MW/minute the unit would have loaded to 306 MW
by the end of the next hour. the unit would have loaded 3.6 MW/minute *
60 minutes or 216 MW. The increase of 216 MW represents an average of
108 MWhrs for the hour. Add the 90 MW from where the unit started from
its previous hourly dispatch and you will have an average for the next
hour of 198 MWhrs, this represents the maximum hourly average this unit
can perform and yet SCUC has the unit loaded to an average of 241 MWhrs.
This is impossible for the unit to load to and should represent a
deficiency for this hour in the DAM.

To further increase this problem SCUC has accepted the reserve bids from
this unit for both 10 minute spin and 30 minute spin for the hour that
the unit was already loading at its maximum loading rate. Since the unit
is already loading at its maximum rate, the unit should not be
considered for reserve since it cannot participate.

This problem is not isolated to this particular unit and is replicated
on our other units also.
If generators cannot follow their DAM schedules they must buy this
energy from the R/T even though it is impossible for them to match their
physical capabilities against their financial obligations as they are
dispatched to in the DAM. Add this to the fact the unit(s) are unable to
provide reserve to the system when they are already loading at their
maximum rate represents a system security problem.

I would suggest that SCUC only load generation at what the generation
can actually load to and be restricted to a maximum change hour over
hour of 30 minutes times their loading rate and if the unit is already
loading at its maximum rate then it should not be able to participate in
the reserve market.

I may be missing something but then again maybe not, hence the note to
the TIE list if other generators are affected in a similar fashion.

purpose of relating some information I have received from Rod Boshcee of 
PG&E.  The conference number is 1-800-991-9019, passcode 6000796.  Rod left a 
very friendly detailed message on my voice mail yesterday afternoon related 
to the upcoming proposed shutdown and testing of the separators at Topock 
(which they previously agreed would be done around September 11 or 12.  He 
asked on the voice mail that I give him a call back and let him know what our 
decision is as soon as possible.

The following will attempt to summarize his voice mail message and will be 
the subject of our call today:
Rod stated that when we were together at Flagstaff in July we had decided to 
again take the system down and sample the separators around September 11 and 
12.
He said PG&E has continued to monitor their unit and have found nothing new 
since the June 29 test.
Rod also said that they have gotten consistent numbers downstream since June 
29 and everything seems stabilized.
He said that PG&E is ""happy"" with the operation of the separators and they 
seem to be doing the job that TW had said they would do.
Rod said that PG&E would go along with TW's thoughts on it, but they were 
wondering if it was really necessary to take the system down in mid-September 
or not since things were looking good?  He said they could go either way on 
it.
Rod closed by saying that they still had some concern about the sterility of 
the 1800' of pipe that connects TW's Meter Run with PG&E's Topock Compressor 
Station.  However, it seemed to be OK for now and they would have no other 
thoughts on it as long as the numbers stay consistently low on their side.
He asked that we let him know what we want to do as soon as possible so 
scheduling will not be a problem.

I would propose that we discuss this matter and then we can call him back and 
furnish our recommendation.  The cooperative tone of his call is something we 
want to continue to build upon and I do want us to be promptly responsive in 
that regard.  Thanks, John",Non Abusive

In addition to adjustments to billing units due to the receipt of billing
quality
metering data, this settlement adjustment includes the following billing code
modifications/corrections:

   Billing code was modified to model scheduling & dispatch of grouped
   generators
   for settlement of energy & bid production cost guarantee payments.
   Generators
   affected by this modification should see proper payment of those 
quantities.
   Any
   costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers
   through
   their OATT Schedule 1 residual & BPCG adjustments
   For the December settlement adjustment, billing code was modified to ensure
   that
   appropriate prices corrections resulting from ECA-B were captured in the
   billing.
   This may impact transmission customers whose transactions were subject to
   ECA-B
   treatment, resulting in transmission usage charge adjustments.  Any costs
   incurred
   by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers through their 
OATT
   Schedule 1 residual adjustment.
   For the December settlement adjustment, a number of grandfathered rights &
   TCC
   configurations were corrected.  Customers affected by this would see either
   their
   TCC's converted back to grandfathered rights, or vice versa.  Any excess or
   deficiency
   in cost recovery will be balanced with the Transmission Owners, based upon
   their
   respective megawatt-mile coefficients.
   There was a code modification to allow for Class 2 PURPA generators to sell
   all
   over-generation to the real-time market.  This would result in payment to
   those
   affected suppliers.    Any costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered 
from
   transmission customers through their OATT Schedule 1 residual adjustment.

placed a call to Rod Boschee and we discussed the following items.  One of 
the key points Rod made is summarized at bullet four below.  Evidently, they 
want to take the maximum amount of gas from us for as long as they can.

We appreciated his phone call and the cooperative effort that was working 
well.  I told Rod that we were also very pleased with the results experienced 
since the June 29 cleaning and testing of the separators.  As far as we knew 
TW's system was staying dry and we were moving no significant liquids into 
their separator.
TW would go along with PG&E and agree that we would not take the system down 
in mid-September to re-check the separators at this point since we were not 
seeing any alarming numbers or quantities.
In place of taking the system down in mid-September, TW and PG&E would watch 
for an upset and a large quantity or a higher concentration - if that occurs, 
then we would immediately get together and plan a time to take the system 
down and check things out.
PG&E is requesting that TW keep flow rates up the rest of the summer, all 
fall and into the winter.  PG&E might want us to take the system down and 
check the separators sometime next year - but they want to talk about going 
as long as we can before we do that.  
Rod agreed that we would still meet as planned in October in Las Vegas.  
(Caveat:  Because of all of the EOTT things going on and other related 
issues, it would help my schedule greatly if we could shift that proposed 
meeting from October 10 to anytime the week of October 16 or October 23?  I 
would appreciate it if Mike Nelson or David Roensch could arrange the meeting 
to be delayed a week or so).  The agenda for the meeting would be related to 
updating everyone on testing results, scheduling the down-time at a mutually 
agreeable time next year for checking the separators, build-out of certain 
facilities on their system related to receiving TW's gas, etc.   
We would agree to do nothing about the 1800' of interconnecting pipe at this 
point.
If you have any questions, please advise.  John Shafer",Non Abusive

43940,campbell-l/all_documents/1694.,<20894642.1075857902104.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Steve Fernand's comments on the recent ICAP deficiency auction results are
based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the ICAP market.  This
misunderstanding is summarized in his statement that ""Unlike the electric
commodity, there have been no significant changes in the underlying costs
for suppliers of ICAP.""  Since last summer there have been very significant
changes in the factors that affect the ICAP markets in New York.

The basic principle of the ICAP market is that it provides the generator (or
external ICAP provider) a mechanism to recover costs that are not adequately
recovered from the energy market.  In return for this revenue the generator
accepts an obligation to bid into the NYISO day-ahead energy market every
day that the generator is not out of service due to either maintenance or
forced outage.

The basic theory on developing a bid into the ICAP market for an internal
generator is that the generator should estimate the total revenue it
requires from the ICAP market to continue operating. This calculation is
based upon its total cost of remaining in business less its expected profits
from the energy market (expected revenues less expected fuel costs).  For
external suppliers the ICAP bid is based upon the opportunity cost of being
obligated to the New York energy market rather than being either obligated
to another market or having no obligations to any market.

Clearly, in each case, the bid into the capacity market is dependent upon
the expectations of the New York energy market.  There have been several
adopted and proposed changes in the New York energy markets that make them
both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy
markets surrounding New York.  These include:

The Circuit Breaker/AMP - The Circuit Breaker/AMP creates both a concern
that the day-ahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that
should exist.  The implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns
that the market prices in New York energy price will be depressed.  The
potential ways in which the DAM prices could be depressed include failure to
incorporate changing unit operating parameters, fuel costs, or emissions
costs.  Additionally, while opportunity costs are a part of an acceptable
bid, there is no methodology to keep the circuit breaker from effectively
removing the opportunity costs for a circuit broken bid.  Finally, the
design of the circuit breaker may result in numerous individual bids by
different market participants being circuit broken when they are not
exercises of market power.  Every time a bid is improperly circuit broken it
affects all sellers because all sellers end up being paid less in the DAM
then they should have received.

In addition to these questions about whether the AMP will improperly depress
prices, there is still uncertainty to how  a generator that has been
improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated.  This was
part of the original circuit breaker design but as of this point the NYISO
has failed to provide any description of how this process will work.  There
is also uncertainty about the reference prices and the process that
generators will follow in getting changes or exceptions to the reference
prices accepted.  The uncertainty raises the cost of being obligated to the
New York market.

Price Capped Load Bidding - The price capped load bidding mechanism that is
being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small
subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at
the DAM market prices.  This provides the possibility that day-ahead market
prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if
this mechanism is abused.  Virtual load bidding has been blocked for the
summer.  If virtual load bidding were implemented it would provide a
potential check on this market manipulating behavior.  The only check
allowed in our market design is the inclusion of opportunity costs in the
generator day-ahead market bids.  As addressed above, the application of the
Circuit Breaker/AMP is likely to impede the generators including opportunity
costs in their bids thereby eliminating the only check on using the price
capped load bids to manipulate the market.

Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal -  This proposal will penalize market
participants that are mitigated for exceeding the NYISO Market Mitigation
Measures. There have been issues raised related to this proposal regarding
due process and fundamental fairness.  The penalties only apply to
generators and other suppliers.  The penalty is not based upon a
determination that the market participant has exercised market power.
Finally, the ADR process can determine whether mitigation was properly
applied by the NYISO but cannot determine whether the penalty that was
applied was appropriate.

Each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy
market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the New York market.
The above price control measures are not in place in the surrounding
markets.  Each of these makes the New York market less desirable than its
neighbors and raises the price of being obligated to the New York market.
Interestingly, the Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal was approved by
the NYISO Management Committee between the ICAP Monthly auction and the ICAP
Deficiency auction.

The above are not the only price control proposals that have been made for
the NYISO energy market.  Most notably, there have been proposals for $150
price caps in the energy market and retroactive price authority.
Fortunately, both of these ill-considered proposals were ultimately
withdrawn.  However, the mere fact that they were proposed inflicts
uncertainty on the energy market and therefore increases the expected prices
in the ICAP market.

Two final points need to be clarified regarding Mr. Fernand's argument that
the results of the auction indicate a problem.  First, he lists the change
in ICAP market clearing prices between last year and this year as indicating
there is a problem in the ICAP markets.  When generators bid into last
summer's auction they had not yet experienced summer operation under the
NYISO markets. There also had not been the broad range of price control
measures proposed and adopted for this summer.  Compared to last summer,
ICAP bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of
the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected impacts of
the price control measures.  Second, he also uses the results of this
summer's strip/monthly auction and the deficiency auction as an indication
of there being problems in the ICAP market.  Because the entire ICAP
requirement is not cleared in a single auction, the prices that are bid into
the earlier auctions are essentially an ICAP providers estimate of its
opportunity cost of selling in the earlier auction rather than selling in a
later auction.  This requires the ICAP providers to guess the likely bids of
the marginal ICAP providers.  The results of this years auctions merely
indicate that those who sold in the early auctions apparently did not do a
very good job of guessing the lost revenue associated with selling in the
earlier auctions.

Mr. Fernand's provides a set of proposed measures for addressing the ICAP
issue.  If any of them are worthy of be considered then they should be aired
through the committee process.  Nonetheless, one of the proposals should be
killed at the outset.  Because being an ICAP provider to New York includes
an obligation to bid into the energy market, no ICAP owners should ever be
""automatically bid into the Deficiency Auction"" or any other auction.  Mr.
Fernand's suggests that that the automatic bidding requirement be relieved
if a Long ICAP Owner exclude itself.  The act of choosing not to bid into
the ICAP auction is in itself an indication that the ICAP provider has
chosen to exclude itself.

In addition to adjustments to billing units due to the receipt of billing
quality
metering data, this settlement adjustment includes the following billing code
modifications/corrections:

   Billing code was modified to model scheduling & dispatch of grouped
   generators
   for settlement of energy & bid production cost guarantee payments.
   Generators
   affected by this modification should see proper payment of those 
quantities.
   Any
   costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers
   through
   their OATT Schedule 1 residual & BPCG adjustments
   For the December settlement adjustment, billing code was modified to ensure
   that
   appropriate prices corrections resulting from ECA-B were captured in the
   billing.
   This may impact transmission customers whose transactions were subject to
   ECA-B
   treatment, resulting in transmission usage charge adjustments.  Any costs
   incurred
   by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers through their 
OATT
   Schedule 1 residual adjustment.
   For the December settlement adjustment, a number of grandfathered rights &
   TCC
   configurations were corrected.  Customers affected by this would see either
   their
   TCC's converted back to grandfathered rights, or vice versa.  Any excess or
   deficiency
   in cost recovery will be balanced with the Transmission Owners, based upon
   their
   respective megawatt-mile coefficients.
   There was a code modification to allow for Class 2 PURPA generators to sell
   all
   over-generation to the real-time market.  This would result in payment to
   those
   affected suppliers.    Any costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered 
from
   transmission customers through their OATT Schedule 1 residual adjustment.

The total dollar amount for 1999 Expense in the ET&S Albuquerque Region is 
$345,000 (excluding Gomez, Bell Lake, & N. Crawar remediation projects which 
are accounted for separately due to sale agreements). This amount is not 
allocated for specific projects but includes all environmental O&M costs for 
the region. As it is, this amount may not be sufficient to cover costs for 
the ongoing Expense projects, including: Thoreau Lease Payment, Roswell 
Remediation, WT-1 Dehy Area Remediation, WT-1 Pit Area Remediation, Eunice 
Monitoring, & Puckett Monitoring. The Albuquerque Region 1999 Capital budget 
for remediation projects is about $270,000; this includes: Thoreau 
Remediation, Laguna Groundwater Remediation, Lockridge Remediation, and 
Atoka-1 Remediation. If the capital projects are rolled into O&M, the O&M 
budget will be far too insufficient. A related issue is concerning the 
allocated AFUDC costs. These costs will add about $60,000 to the Thoreau 
Remediation project cost and about $10,000 to each of the Laguna and Atoka-1 
Remediation projects. These costs were not budgeted for because I was under 
the assumption that new work orders would be issued for 1999, in which case, 
AFUDC costs would only be allocated based on 1999 spending charged to the new 
work orders. New work orders were not issued and the 1999 budgeted amount for 
the Thoreau Remediation of $78,000 can not possibly absorb the anticipated 
AFUDC costs. 

I will keep you posted of any further developments. Thanks, George

Subject: AFUDC on Remediation Projects

George,
This whole deal is still up in the air.  When I brought up the subject of 
AFUDC to Property Accounting, they started questioning whether these 
particular projects qualify to be ""CAPITAL"" at all.  I discussed the matter 
with Dan Pribble and he says to leave them as capital as long as I can but 
Property Accounting is going to want some real substantial justification 
before long for continuing to carry them in their arena.

And, if we end up having to dump a substantial portion of the total costs in 
all 5 of the current workorders to O&M, that will really kill the O&M budgets 
of the affected Teams.

So, don't do anything different from what you have been doing until we tell 
you different.

Thanks.

IF there is no increase in emissions, this is probably not a modification

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Mark,
Thank you for your thoughtful response.  I think you raise some valid
points, but I do not think they change the end conclusion.

Fundamental Value of ICAP
The principle of the ICAP market, as in any market, should be to reflect the
value of the underlying product that is being sold to the market.  The
question is whether the product being sold, in this case ICAP, has truly
appreciated more then 400% since the previous ICAP auctions.  Maybe - but I
doubt it.

AMP and Expected Revenue
The premise that changing the existing market mitigation rules to catch rule
breaking on a real time basis instead of a one day lag basis, although
plausible, seems fairly weak.  It presumes that generation owners were
planning on violating the pre-existing screens and counting on the revenue
from those ""golden eggs.""  Likewise, the link between ""expected energy
revenue"" and ICAP prices is tenuous at best.  Generators are not limited to
receiving revenue from the spot market and may well choose to sell energy in
the bilateral market.  In either case the goal of the generation owner is to
maximize revenue through all markets.  The ICAP market, if functioning
properly, should reflect the value of the first call on the energy from the
generator by the NYISO and the ability of the NYISO to curtail external
transactions from that generator.  For example two generation owners owned
two plants with the same characteristics. One generation owner did a
relatively ""good"" job selling a forward energy contract for the 6 month
procurement period while the other owner did a relatively ""poor"" job selling
a similar contract.  In the ICAP auctions they both should have the same
strategy - maximize the revenue that each of them can receive out of the
ICAP auction.  Any other strategy by either of the plants will lead to
overall lower profits.

Price Cap Load Bidding (I won't comment on if Virtual Bidding were in place
because it isn't going to be)
Price Cap Load Bidding has been available in the past, only know it is
expanded slightly to Zonal Price Cap Load Bidding.  This is not a
significant change to the existing rules and would seem unlikely to account
for either a significant change in the expected energy revenue or the
underlying value of the ICAP product.

""...significant uncertainty to the New York market...""
I would agree that all of the rule changes including the Penalty and Public
Disclosure Proposal  made it difficult for generation owners to properly
evaluate the effects of selling ICAP into a 6 month market.  For this
reason, as well as the other possible reasons listed on my letter, I believe
that mitigating measures should be evaluated.  I am not passing judgment at
this stage, but feel that all parties should know that the prices that were
posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent changes may
be required to some or all of the months.

Next Steps
If the MMU determines that there was economic and/ or physical withholding,
whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or
internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the AMP, I believe that it
is most appropriate for the MMU to take immediate action and refer it to the
committees for longer term resolution.

I won't repeat everything that Mark said. I agree with all of it. I
publically stated several times that it would be appropriate for parties to
consider these plus other risk elements in formulating bidding strategies
for upcoming ICAP.

However, it also appears that Steven has forgotten a major and fundamental
change in the ICAP markets. This is surprising as he characterizes ICAP as a
call on the resource. When ICAP was offered for last summer there was no
energy price cap, or effectively the price cap was $10,000, today it is
$1,000. This means that in the context of his analogy a call was offered
last summer with a strike price of $10,000 versus $1,000 today. An order of
magnitude change in strike price for the seller of a call seems pretty major
to me, particularly when coupled with all of the other new risk factors and
general ""tightening"" of supply versus demand.

43958,campbell-l/all_documents/171.,<19136425.1075851881528.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Louie/John, this memo summerizes the results of the environmental due 
diligence which was performed on the Texas Panhandle and Cortez, Colorado 
portions of Equilon pipline system for which EOTT may be interested in 
purchasing.  This memo presents those environmental issues which may be or 
were identified as a potential environmental concern.  

Lefors (Texas Panhandle Segment)

Assets on this portion of the system which may have environmental  issues 
were the following:  1-80,000 bbl. liquids product storage tank, 41 small 
tank batteries consisting of 1-3 product storage tanks each.  Average tank 
size is 210 bbl.  Approximately 15 tank locations are within 1/4 mile of an 
existing waterway.  There are stream and river crossings included in this 
package.  The pipeline crossings viewed appeared to have sufficient  soil 
coverage and did have block valves on the upstream and downstream portions of 
the pipeline crossings.  

1. Clean Air Act.  There were no records kept at any office or location which 
would assist in the determination of compliance with Title III, or Title V.  
The  following documents were not present:  emissions inventories and or 
records of fees paid, O&G MACT compliance (HAP's),  operating permits.  NSPS  
Supart Kb compliance could not be determined also.  The 80,000 bbl tank 
construction date was in the 1930's and has a fixed roof.  It has a concrete  
bottom and the  tank has never been emptied for inspection.  No  Railroad 
Commission 653 inspection has ever been conducted.

2. Clean Water Act.  Although soil berm and containments were present around 
all tanks that were inspected, SPCC plans were not available at any 
location.   Interviews with the Equilon personnel stated that there had never 
been a reportable release from this tank.  In addition, location Texaco MB  
Davis pump  station had a small 3'x4' UST which received liquids from leaking 
packing material which had overflowed and visible soil staining was present.  
At this  location a T-stand pipe had been constructed into the soil berm to 
allow discharge of rainwater from the containment area.  This water 
discharged into  an ephermal arroyo which ultimately collects into the North 
Fork of the Red River, a perennial stream.

3. NESHAPS.  At the Lefors Station, there exists several joints of new and 
used pipe which is suspected of having external coating and pipe wrapping   
containing asbestos.

4. NORMS.  A NORM survey has not been conducted on any portion of the assets 
which are identified in the bid package.

5. Soil Staining.   There was minor soil staining at all locations inspected.

6. There is one active groundwater remediation in progress identified as the 
""10 mile hole"".  Equilon will retain ownership of this issue.  There had been 
two  pipeline remediation projects for which Equilon had reported to the TRRC 
and had remediated the site.

7. TSCA.  One electrical transformer was discovered at the Lefors Station.   
It had been tested and determined to not have PCB's.

8. Safe Drinking Water Act.  There was an abandoned drinking water well at 
the Lefors Station.  It had not been in service for an undetermined period of 
time. 

9. RCRA.  There was an abandoned out of service Fox boro meter at the Lefors 
Station.  Status of the potential releases of mercury could not be visibally  
determined.

not  known whether subsurface soil and groundwater conditions underlying the 
Equilon assets had been impacted.

Cortez Office.  In the office yard, several environmental issues were present 
and are listed as follows:

 old spent 12 volt batteries
 empty drums
 open buckets containing oil and oilfield sludge

The  pipeline stream crossing at the Montezuma Creek  showed the pipeline to 
be exposed in the bottom of the creek for a distance of approx. 12 feet.  
There were block valves on the upstream and downstream segments of this 
crossing.

at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and excelr

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and excelr are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and excelr.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: ""Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue.""
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.",Non Abusive

fuel mixers with carbuerators at  the Spraberry Plant.  It seems that this 
replacement was performed ONLY as a fuel savings activity and that there 
would be no increase in emissions or horsepower as a result.  According to 
the TNRCC, they will allow this activity provided that the above is true and 
that we prove that emissions and horsepower will not increase.  To do this 
they have requested that we conduct an emissions test on one of the units 
with the mixer on and then with the carbuerator on as a condition of their 
approval.  IE before and after testing.  I am going to request that we be 
allowed to do the testing with a portable emissions tester, which has been 
verified in side by side testing on New Mexico units as opposed to bringing 
in a third party referenced testing company.  Contractor testing runs about 
$3-5,000.  

A condition of all permitting issues is that the carbs are not supposed to be 
installed on the units (preconstruction) until approval has been given by the 
agency.  In this case, we will be allowed to install a carbuerator on the one 
unit to be tested but not on all units.  Should testing show other 
exceedances (emissions or Hp) in addition to fuel savings, this will trigger 
actions requiring perimtting.  Under the circumstances, I think it would be 
in the best interest of NNG to know for certain that we have not violated the 
grandfather status of the units and that if our activity requires permitting, 
we comply immediately.

I am sending out the letter request to the TNRCC today.  If approved, we 
should test ASAP.  Remember, that sampling ports in the exhaust stack of the 
unit to be tested will need to be constructed prior to testing.  Let me know

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO deployed code changes affecting Class 1 PURPA
transactions in the billing system and modified bid status flagging in the

These changes impacted settlements for 4/10, 4/11, 4/13, and 4/18 - forward.

There was a code design problem with the PURPA code change that resulted in an
error in the computation of balancing energy for some class 1 units that
resulted in their purchasing their entire day-ahead schedules in the balancing
market.  There was also an oversight in the implementation of the modified bid

billing system, impacting bid production cost guarantee settlements for the
units with a modified bid status.

Subject: RE: 150 mW DEC Cap for ""Emergency Exempt"" for EDRP

Larry:

A couple of comments:

1. I recommend that the 150 MW limit be managed by NYISO Operations.  They
are going to understand the problems in real time and should have complete
authority of which generators get run based on the situation. Trying to
fairly rotate which units get called at this late date, given the hours of
operation are completely unknown would be a waste of time, in my opinion.

2. We all should be very grateful that the DEC has taken the action they
have on expanding the exempt generator definition.  If people are not happy
with the 150MW cap then they should get a registration or state facility
permit and notify the ISO that the their site is not to be counted in the
150 MW cap calculation.

3. Not paying full ICAP for these resources would be a disaster.  If we want
to kill the emergency program, this is the best way to do it.  Again,
calling of generators should be based on the NYISO Operations assessment of
the emergency situation.  A special case resource generator standing ready
to serve, even if DEC has placed some limits on the number of MW running at
one time, should not be penalized by this cap.  We may find situations where
some of the SCR ""exempt"" generators called can not start or limit their
generation hours for some reason.  In this case we need as many SCR
resources ready to fill the void as possible. Limit payments really hurts
the credibility and effectiveness of the programs we have all worked so hard
to develop.

4. I do not think the EDRP manuals need to say anything on this subject.
This should strictly be an internal NYISO operation matter on which
generators get called in each zone.  If the Operations manual needs to be
updated to reflect the 150 MW exempt generator class of EDRP generators lets
do it here not in the EDRP manual.

Looking forward to Monday's discussion. Have a great weekend.

Subject: 150 mW DEC Cap for ""Emergency Exempt"" for EDRP

Colleagues,
This is a ""heads up"" that there are several issues we will need to look at
on Monday with respect to the new NYS DEC expanded definition of ""emergency
exempt"" when participating in the EDRP.  The problems needing solving that I
am aware of so far concern the 150 mW cap that DEC placed on the ISO's call
for emergency customer generation.  Our understanding is that more than that
amount can be signed up for the program--but only 150 mWs can be called at
any one time.

Some have suggested that the DEC does not have the right or power to
regulate the NYISO.  I don't know.  But I do know that DEC would revoke this
in heart-beat if they thought we were going to ignore it--especially after
all these different parties, including the ISO and the self-generation
developers, bargained with NYS DEC to do what they have done.  Also, the
individual participating customers would be more than some upset if they
found out that DEC was revoking their emergency exempt status because they
were deemed to have been the ones who were over the 150 mW limit in an
emergency call.

There are two problems that I have seen, both related to enrolling more than
150 mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants.  First, if there is more than
150 mWs in the region being called, we need to determine a method for who
gets called--it could rotate in an equitable fashion.  But our manual should
probably speak to this.

The other problem is that we probably shouldn't be paying full ICAP to 300
mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants if we know that no more than half
of them can respond to any ICAP call.  We might derate them in percentage to
the subscription over the 150 mWs.  Or some other system.

My purpose here is to alert you to the issue and suggest that we want to
come up with a solution on Monday.  I spoke with Mollie Lampi about it and
hope the ISO has a chance to work on it today.  We want all EDRP and DADRP
manual matters to go before the BIC on May 24th.

Have a great weekend and thanks for all of the creative thinking and
constructive participation on getting these programs as right as we can as
quickly as we can!

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO deployed code changes affecting Class 1 PURPA
transactions in the billing system and modified bid status flagging in the
MIS.  These changes impacted settlements for 4/10, 4/11, 4/13, and 4/18 -
forward.

There was a code design problem with the PURPA code change that resulted in
an error in the computation of balancing energy for some class 1 units that
resulted in their purchasing their entire day-ahead schedules in the
balancing market.  There was also an oversight in the implementation of the
modified bid status flagging in the MIS such that those bids were not
transferred into the billing system, impacting bid production cost
guarantee settlements for the units with a modified bid status.

The NYISO will be issuing a supplemental invoice for April 2001 settlements
on Tuesday, May 15th to adjust for the aforementioned issues.  Funds due
the NYISO for this supplemental invoice should be transferred into the
NYISO Clearing Account by close of business Wednesday, May 23, 2001.  Funds

I received a call from Ronnie Ben (520) 871-7995 of the Navajo Nation EPA 
requesting corrosion records for all pipelines owned by Transwestern on the 
Navajo Nation.  We talked for awhile and I informed him that John Gormley in 
Albuquerque handled corrosion on those portions of the Transwestern line on  
reservation lands.  He said that he would be contacting John and a request 
will be made for all corrosion records and compliance activities for 
pipelines on the reservation. This may be a ripple effect from the El Paso 
incident near Carlsbad, N.M. which happened a couple of weeks ago.

If only 150 MW can be called on when the NYISO needs them then no more than
150 MW should be allowed to qualify as ICAP providers.  The purpose of ICAP
is to assure that the NYISO has capacity when it needs it.  ""Having"" the

Resources that cannot be called upon are do not add to system security.

Larry:

A couple of comments:

1. I recommend that the 150 MW limit be managed by NYISO Operations.  They
are going to understand the problems in real time and should have complete
authority of which generators get run based on the situation. Trying to
fairly rotate which units get called at this late date, given the hours of
operation are completely unknown would be a waste of time, in my opinion.

2. We all should be very grateful that the DEC has taken the action they
have on expanding the exempt generator definition.  If people are not happy
with the 150MW cap then they should get a registration or state facility
permit and notify the ISO that the their site is not to be counted in the
150 MW cap calculation.

3. Not paying full ICAP for these resources would be a disaster.  If we want
to kill the emergency program, this is the best way to do it.  Again,
calling of generators should be based on the NYISO Operations assessment of
the emergency situation.  A special case resource generator standing ready
to serve, even if DEC has placed some limits on the number of MW running at
one time, should not be penalized by this cap.  We may find situations where
some of the SCR ""exempt"" generators called can not start or limit their
generation hours for some reason.  In this case we need as many SCR
resources ready to fill the void as possible. Limit payments really hurts
the credibility and effectiveness of the programs we have all worked so hard
to develop.

4. I do not think the EDRP manuals need to say anything on this subject.
This should strictly be an internal NYISO operation matter on which
generators get called in each zone.  If the Operations manual needs to be
updated to reflect the 150 MW exempt generator class of EDRP generators lets
do it here not in the EDRP manual.

Looking forward to Monday's discussion. Have a great weekend.

Subject:        150 mW DEC Cap for ""Emergency Exempt"" for EDRP

Colleagues,
This is a ""heads up"" that there are several issues we will need to look at
on Monday with respect to the new NYS DEC expanded definition of ""emergency
exempt"" when participating in the EDRP.  The problems needing solving that I
am aware of so far concern the 150 mW cap that DEC placed on the ISO's call
for emergency customer generation.  Our understanding is that more than that
amount can be signed up for the program--but only 150 mWs can be called at
any one time.

Some have suggested that the DEC does not have the right or power to
regulate the NYISO.  I don't know.  But I do know that DEC would revoke this
in heart-beat if they thought we were going to ignore it--especially after
all these different parties, including the ISO and the self-generation
developers, bargained with NYS DEC to do what they have done.  Also, the
individual participating customers would be more than some upset if they
found out that DEC was revoking their emergency exempt status because they
were deemed to have been the ones who were over the 150 mW limit in an
emergency call.

There are two problems that I have seen, both related to enrolling more than
150 mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants.  First, if there is more than
150 mWs in the region being called, we need to determine a method for who
gets called--it could rotate in an equitable fashion.  But our manual should
probably speak to this.

The other problem is that we probably shouldn't be paying full ICAP to 300
mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants if we know that no more than half
of them can respond to any ICAP call.  We might derate them in percentage to
the subscription over the 150 mWs.  Or some other system.

My purpose here is to alert you to the issue and suggest that we want to
come up with a solution on Monday.  I spoke with Mollie Lampi about it and
hope the ISO has a chance to work on it today.  We want all EDRP and DADRP
manual matters to go before the BIC on May 24th.

Have a great weekend and thanks for all of the creative thinking and
constructive participation on getting these programs as right as we can as
quickly as we can!

Discussion List:

The 150 MW limitation on ICAP eligibility should only apply to SCR resources
that would fall within the DEC cap.  Any SCR resource that is exempt should
not be limited in its ability to sell ICAP (I never meant to imply they
should).

As to whether the cap is enforceable or whether the NYISO will comply, it
seems the fastest way to have the exemption yanked is for the NYISO to not
comply with the DEC's wishes.

We can talk about this at the PRL meeting on Monday but ultimately this is
an issue for ICAP working group and possibly the NYSRC.

Subject: Re: 150 mW DEC Cap for ""Emergency Exempt"" for EDRP

We can flesh this discussion out next week, but from the outset, Mark's
and Roy's comments are overly simplistic and overly restrictive.

First of all, not all SCR resources are impacted by the DEC cap. Many
will now be forced to go the route of obtaining Registration or State
Facility status, either of which allows then to operate above the 150 MW
cap. Lacking any DEC-imposed limit, all such permitted facilities must
be allowed to sign up for full SCR value. Obviously, other SCR
resources, not tied to emergency generation are also unaffected and
cannot be limited.

Even with respect to the Centrally Dispatched Emergency Power Generating
Units (CDEPGs), as John Prunkl points out, it is ISO Operations staff
that will need to decide on a real-time basis which SCR units should be
called. Due to the locational nature of the EDRP calls, a unit called
one day, may or may not be needed the next. Only in the case where there
will always be a clear overlap should any consideration be given to
precluding an SCR resource from participating and even then, as with
generators, there is no guarantee that all SCR-certified units will be
there when called upon.

The proper approach is not to limit who can sign up for SCR, but to
decide what protocols will be used to allocate activations during
emergencies. SCR resources that get signed up, but cannot be called due
to the limit would be analogous to generating units that sell ICAP, but
cannot operate when needed due to air permit or manufacturer warrantee
limitations. I think this would mean a UCAP ""hit"" for future sales.

As a more fundamental matter, I do not believe that DEC's ill-advised
150 MW limit (which was not agreed to by the NYISO) is currently
enforceable as a practical matter.

Only the NYISO knows when the 150 MW cap is being approached and
therefore the ISO's failure to adhere to that limit should not be held
against the affected generators. Nevertheless, the DEC ruling appears to
revoke the CDEPG status of ALL emergency generators upon a finding that
the NYISO has violated the 150 MW limit.

The DEC Emergency Ruling is not enforceable on the NYISO, which does not
hold permits or exemptions regulated by DEC. If NYISO agrees to abide by
the 150 MW limitation it will apparently be because it volunteers to do
so. I am unaware that the ISO has so agreed.

Consider the following: NYISO is faced with an emergency situation where
the lights would go out in New York City with 150 MW of CDEPGs but could
stay on with 160 MW. I believe that the ISO operators might have no
choice but to order the 160 MW on and preserve reliability,
notwithstanding the DEC limitation.

By placing CDEPGs in the position to be penalized for actions over which
they have literally no knowledge, let alone control, DEC's action
currently forces all emergency generators to seek Registration or State
Facility Permits.

The only apparent alternative is that CDEPGs must be given ironclad
assurances in SOAS-approved Operating Manuals that operations staff can
NEVER call on more than 150 MW of CDEPGs at any given time. Even then,
it is unclear how the ISO can provide generators with conclusive
assurances that they will not find their emergency exempt status
revoked. CDEPGs may be forced to seek real-time certifications from the
NYISO at the time they are called that their activation will not exceed
the 150 MW limit.

I would be interested in the ISO's opinion on whether it can, and will,
limit activations of CDEPGs to less than 150 MW, no matter what the
circumstances.

Subject: Compliance with the Large Quantity Generator Requirements, 
Transwestern Pipeline Company

A review was completed of the storage tank requirements for  large quantity 
generators of hazardous waste.  These regulations apply to almost each 
mainline C/S in New Mexico,  Arizona and California (initiating at Station 9, 
Roswell to Needles and including the tanks on the Topock Lateral).  There are 
eighteen condensate tanks on the Transwestern mainline system which could 
potentially be impacted, however, only about 10 tanks have received hazardous 
waste liquids in the last 3-4 years.   The constituents which make these 
tanks fall under Subtitle C of RCRA  is the arsenic, lead and low flashpoint 
(VOC's) of the condensate.   PCB's are another issue and are subject to other 
requirements. 

Briefly, the liquids which collect into the tanks is highly variable in 
quantity, contaminant concentration and with respect to when condensate 
enters the tanks.  When the gas is extremely dry, no condensate is 
collected.  During periods of wet gas movement, condensate with arsenic, lead 
and low flashpoint is collected.  In the 1980's to mid 90's, all eighteen 
tanks collected sufficient condensate with arsenic, lead, flashpoint and 
PCB's that the contensate in the tanks was hauled away every 90 days.   From 
1995 up to 1999, the system was essentially dry and no liquids were 
collected.  The tanks did not fall under the hazardous waste requirements.  
However, this year, we are seeing more liquids hauled away as hazardous waste 
than we have seen in the past 4-5 years. 

I would like to discuss the issue of compliance with these tanks.  The 
consistency and volume of regulated  liquids which are now being collected at 
the C/S tanks warrants a discussion.   The El Paso incident may be a driving 
force in this issue.....

The Credit Policy Working Group, which has been assigned by the Budget,
Standards, and Performance Subcommittee to address the details necessary to
develop a NYISO Credit Policy, I believe is converging on a proposal that I
expect will be drafted and available from NYISO staff by May 18.  Since the
BSP has been assigned by the Management Committee to recommend a credit
policy, the full BSP needs to review this proposal and attempt to reach a
consensus position to recommend to the Management Committee at its June 6
meeting.  Absent that, we need to able to present majority and minority
proposals.

In anticipation of this proposal being available May 18, and consistent
with the goal of presenting a recommendation to the Management Committee
for a vote at its June 6 meeting, I am scheduling two BSP meetings (in
addition to the May 21 which is to address business planning goals).

The first meeting will be Tuesday, May 22, 2001, starting at 9:30 AM in
Conference Room ""WA"" at the NYISO offices on Washington Avenue Extension in

transactions in the billing system and modified bid status flagging in the
MIS.  These changes impacted settlements for 4/10, 4/11, 4/13, and 4/18 -
forward.

There was a code design problem with the PURPA code change that resulted in
an error in the computation of balancing energy for some class 1 units that
resulted in their purchasing their entire day-ahead schedules in the
balancing market.  There was also an oversight in the implementation of the
modified bid status flagging in the MIS such that those bids were not
transferred into the billing system, impacting bid production cost
guarantee settlements for the units with a modified bid status.

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined excelr Corp.

Subject: August 29, 2000 Report on Midland Tour

Lou, once I caught up with the group things went ok, but the entire day 
seemed rushed to me.  It takes longer to look at things environmentally than 
it does the rest of the group.  The group is quite large I estimate at 20 to 
25 with both EOTT and Equilon.  With that many people it is hard to organize 
the station tours.  They all took off from Wasson Station and Robin Borders 
had to retrieve me.  

Anyway attached is my days report and the pictures I took.  The description 
of the pictures are below.  I did not know to whom this should be distributed.

PHOTO 2 - 3 inch tank drain at Prentice Station, oil and salt stain
PHOTO 3 - General view of Prentice Station. Showing four pumps and motors and 
5,000  BBL tank in background.
PHOTO 4-  Pig launcher Wasson Station, oil stained soil
PHOTO 5- Truck loading area on east side of Wasson Station, fresh oil and oil 
stained soil
PHOTO 6- Roof drain 80.000 BBL tank Wasson Station
PHOTO 7- Oil stained soil associated with mixer on 30,000 BBL tank, Wasson 
Station
PHOTO 8- Close up of mixer on 30,000 BBL tan Wsson Station, previously shown 
in Photo 7
PHOTO 9 - 3,000 BBL tank Flanagan Station
PHOTO 10- 1,300 BBL and 3,000 BBL tanks , Flanagan Station
PHOTO 11- Pig launcher Flanagan Station, containment shows signs of crude oil
PHOTO 12- Pumps Flanagan Station, shows clean station



I'll work on my attachment technique, numerical.

Dear MAPP Transmission Providers and Customers,

On Wednesday, May 16th at 11:30pm CDT the MAPP OASIS NODE will be taken
off-line for approximately 1 hour for database maintenance.  At the same
time the latest version of OASIS software will be installed , v2.7.0d.

How does this effect MAPP Transmission Providers:

The new version of OASIS software allows for specific redirect service
types.  Two new option fields have been added to the service types, ""Allow
on Redirect"" and ""Account on Reduction"".

These two fields can be changed by selecting ""Transmission Services"" under
Provider Maintenance, and then click on the ID to update the transmission
service.

The ""Allow on Redirect"" option determines whether the service type appears
in the drop down box on the REDIRECT transmission request template.

The ""Account On Reduction"" determines whether REDIRECT request types appear
in the ""Query for Reductions"".

All services types will default to ""No"" for
the two new fields for existing transmission services.

Requirements:
Before the upgrade
1.  All ""Capacity Type"" entries must be unique for each transmission
provider.  Please change your ""Capacity Types"" so that they are unique.

 The ""Capacity Type"" will be changed by the MAPPCOR staff at the time of
upgrade if the unique ""Capacity Type"" for each provider is violated.

After the upgrade
1.  If you do have Redirect transmission service types then select ""Yes"" for
the ""Allow on Redirect"" field.

The MAPP OASIS Test node is available for testing version 2.7.0d.  The test
node can be accessed at:
http://mappb3.oasis.mapp.org/OASIS14/NODE/MAPPB3

How does this effect MAPP Schedule F Customers:

MAPP Schedule F Transmission Customers should select ""HNF Secondary"" as the
Service for redirecting a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm reservation as
Non-Firm.

In addition, to redirect a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm
reservation on Firm basis then one of the following services should be
selected ""FCTS Daily"", ""FCTS Weekly"", ""FCTS Monthly"", ""FCTS Seasonal"", ""FCTS
Yearly"", and ""FCTS Monthly 1 Month"" depending on the remaining duration.

Please try to have your business needs concluded prior to this outage.  We
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Please contact the MAPP Transaction Coordinator if you have further
questions at 651.632.8508 or at transcoords@mapp.org.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

MAPP Transaction Coordinator

44035,campbell-l/all_documents/1782.,<18239294.1075857904444.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Hey Guys,

We have been researching PJM transmission settlement and have found an 
inconsistency in how deals are settled in PJM and 
how they are getting into Enpower.

I would like to propose that any deal for transmission be entered into 
Enpower as documented below.  Please come to me if you 
have any questions.

Volume Management is attempted to set up a process to reconcile these volumes 
on a daily and monthly basis, so bear with us 
until the process is in place and everyone is up to speed.

Thanks,

Rebecca


PJM TRANSMISSION PROCEDURE

Every time an OASIS request is accepted in PJM a deal is entered into 
Enpower...  

 1)  with a demand volume equal to the amount reserved
 2)  demand price of $0.67
 3)  trans volume equal to the volume FLOWED (or expected to flow)
 4)  trans price of $0.48
 5) Comments with the PJM OASIS number for reference (buy and sell 
transaction ids if available)

Examples:

A) If EPMI reserve 100mw of transmission on peak for the whole month, but we

The BS&P Subcommittee is scheduled to meet Monday, May 21, 2001 starting at
9:30 a.m. in conference room ""WA"" at the NYISO offices on Washington Ave.
in Albany.  A conference call number has also been set up as follows:

(601) 354-1086  Participant Code 616484

Our agenda will be as follows:

1.  Review Management Committee meeting of May 10, 2001 regarding the
proposed budget revision and action by the NYISO Board.

2.  Meet with Chuck King and review the details of the Market Services
Budget for 2001 and expectations for 2002.  We will also take advantage of
this opportunity to meet with Chuck to help us develop better 2002 goals
for customer service responsiveness.

3.  Review the comments received from market participants on the draft
goals we sent out to the tie list, and finalize a list of goals to serve as
input to the NYISO internal business planning process.



The BS&P Subcommittee is also scheduled to meet Tuesday, May 22, 2001
starting at 9:30 a.m. in conference room ""WA"" at the NYISO offices on
Washington Ave. in Albany.  A conference call number has also been set up
as follows:

(505) 242-2420  participant code 265727

As described in a previous e-mail, the purpose of this meeting is to review
the progress of the Credit Policy Working Group (CPWG) in developing a
comprehensive proposal to take to the Management Committee.  Based on
discussions of the CPWG this week, it does not appear a consensus proposal
to the BS&P will be achievable for this meeting, however, the CPWG, Andy
Ragogna, and I believe a detailed presentation to the full BS&P by NYISO
staff of the work accomplished to date, identification of open issues, and
a discussion of how to proceed is appropriate at this time given the
complexity of this issue.  In-person attendance at this meeting is
encouraged.

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the MIS, OASIS and BAS that will be
implemented on May 29, 2001.

* Changes will be made to the Market Information System (MIS) to
make in-hour curtailment prioritization of transactions more
consistent with the BME scheduling process. Specific changes will
be made to:
- the NERC / ranked ordering,
- the addition of message for ICAP recall,
- the exclusion of Federal contracts from ICAP transactions
recalled, and
- the inclusion of exports from LBMP reference bus as ICAP
transactions.

* Also, for a transaction with an external source, the decremental
dollar will no longer be calculated. Please see Technical Bulletin
#61 for more information regarding transaction curtailments.

http://www.nyiso.com/services/documents/techbulletins/index.html

* Changes will also be made to the MIS to remove the $20,000 bias
from day ahead external transactions.

* New data will be posted to the NYISO OASIS web site to enhance
the presentation of real time data. The elements being added to
the web site include zonal real time (5 minute) load values and
zonal forecast load values. Consistent with a resolution passed by
the Business Issues Committee (BIC), zones J & K will be combined.

* The Shared Activation of Reserves (SAR) package on the real time
system will be enhanced to accommodate support for Hydro Quebec
(HQ) wheel-through transactions.

* The NYISO Day-ahead Price Responsive Load Program will be
implemented in both the MIS and the Billing and Accounting (BAS)
systems. The Day-ahead Price Responsive Load program offers
NYISO Customers the ability to supply a bid to the MIS indicating
the cost at which it will reduce its demand by a specified number
of MWs. The program will make use of the existing bidding and
scheduling web pages and upload / download templates.  However,
you must register for this program. Contact your Customer
Relations representative for details. Documents containing
instructions with more details will be issued soon.

* Other changes to the Billing & Accounting system (BAS) will
incorporate changes to the Daily Advisory Statements that will
provide additional columns of information on the Power Suppliers
section of the advisory. Also, new CSV reports will be provided
that give more detailed load information and static sub-zone
definition. More information will be provided soon about a
software tool to filter this new data.  It will be provided for
Market Participants whose automated data retrieval systems are not

After reading Pete's update on MIS changes that will go into effect May 29,  I
have tried the phone route with the NYISO and haven't found a live person to
answer a question I have regarding the $20,000 day ahead adder. The removal of
the $20,000 adder was supposed to be in conjunction with the proposal passed 
by
BIC and MC back in Sept, where the external proxy busses would clear at BME
instead of LBMP. Subsquently it was determined that due to soft ware 
limitations
and the study that long term prices indicated that the BME clearing prices 
would
have big uplift impact since BME averaged higher then the LBMP. The answer was
to automate ECA06B so that when there was congestion that only the proxy bus
effected would clear at BME, in effect eliminating the need for the $20,000
adder. Soooo the question is: Is the automated ECA06B going to be in place May
29?
Another thought along these lines...Will the removal of the $20,000 adder to
non constrained proxy busses pose a problem for those who don't want their DAM
schedules bumped by HAM schedules? Will simply babysitting your schedules by
changing the HAM bids be sufficent?
Since I'm on a roll, what about the fact that according to Tech Bull. 61 that
IS+ is still changing Export Sink Price Caps to a -$100 Dec Bid in spite of 
the
fact that BIC and MC back in Sept passed a motion to change this so that the 
Dec
bid would be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign from the SPC Bid? Which 
is
wrong, Tech Bull 61, IS+ or me? Please only pick one, and it must pertain to
this narrow question.

Subject: Environmental findings, Koch South Texas Records Review

Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were 
identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch 
facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year.

All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the 
Koch office  were reviewed.  Assumptions were made that the environmental 
records were complete for all assets included in the sale.  Primary emphasis 
was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a 
sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of 
crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical 
assets which were reviewed. 

Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the 
following:

  Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee 
payments were documented 

  NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks 
were documented 

  Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date

  SARA compliance and reporting had been completed

  SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112

  Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were 
available for review

   There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site 
included in the asset for sale
     (permits for the remediation activity is in place)

  Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were 
documented

Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified 
which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a 
considered a major environmental  liability.  This statement is again based 
upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the 
data room for the assets in question.  It should also be stated that this 
analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch 
has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge 
during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files.

Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a 
recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to 
each location to verify findings from the records review.   Also, due to the 
past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract 
conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for 
discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have 
occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.

44075,campbell-l/all_documents/182.,<25374714.1075851881784.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Gentlemen,

As you are aware, David Roensch, Larry Campbell and I just traveled to Penn 
State University and had a lengthy meeting with Dr. Adawaumi.  This meeting 
was mainly related to obtaining an update on exactly where they were in 
progressing with the PCB Behavioral and Hydrodynamic Model for TW's Pipeline 
System.  For your reference I have attached to this note what I consider to 
be the key points from that meeting.   I hope you will take a few moments and 
review the attachment.  I will be glad to discuss any questions you might 
have.  

Based on what we learned during the meeting with Dr. Adawaumi, I am 
recommending that we have a meeting in the near future to discuss what the 
appropriate next steps should be related to whether or not we enter into 
Phase II (which would include cleaning an actual segment of TW's system) of 
this process.  My Secretary will be contacting you in the next few days to 
establish a time when you would be available for such a meeting (4 hours is 
needed).  For this meeting, Dr. Adawaumi will be asked to come down from PSU 
to make about a one hour presentation related to his findings and 
recommendations at this point.

I believe you will find this very informative and essential in establishing 
what our next steps will be.  

Thanks, John Shafer

there is shuttle service to Little America, the hotel in Flagstaff for the 2 
night stay.  We plan on visiting stations 3 and 4 on Tuesday.  Then 1 and 2 
on Wednesday.  I dont think that we will need rental cars as Rich, Tiny and I 
will have our company cars.  John had indicated that he needed to make a 
Thursday meeting in Houston, so I only made reservations at Little America 
for Monday and Tuesday night.  Should Randy and or Bill decide to stay over 
on Thursday, we can make reservations for Wednesday also.  Let me know.   I m 
not sure what Louie is doing, he had stated that he would take care of his 
accomodations should he decide to make the trip.   Ive  got business at 
Stations 1 and 2 on Thursday and Friday, so Ill be there the whole week.  As

product skimmers attached to the pumps. The problem is that product is 
forming an emulsion with water and the emulsion is recovered by the skimmers. 
Unfortunately the emulsion is more water than product. I believe this problem 
can be eliminated by using a different type of pump. The current pump system, 
manufactured by Marshalk, uses air to displace the product from the pump. We 
have been using a bladder pump fitted with a skimmer attachment, manufactured 
by Clean Environment Equipment, at Bell Lake and at Ivanhoe with very good 
success (and no emulsion problems). I have ordered three replacement pumps

Subject: Removing impediments to electric generation in western states - w 
hat's in it for the pipelines


Attached is a Word  version of the FERC EL01-47 order, Removing Impediments 
to Electic  Generation  in the Western US.  The order  was issued May  16.  
The order:
 
         (1) Temporarily waives  blanket certificate regulations toincrease 
the dollar  limitations for natural gasfacilities under automatic 
authorization to  $10 million 
        and for prior notice authorizations to $30 million for  all pipelines 
that deliver gas in the WSCC http://www.wscc.com/;
        
        (2)  Temporarily waives blanket certificate regulations to allow 
construction of  mainline facilities, including temporary compression and 
facilities  that alter         mainline  capacity;
 
        (3)Allows  pipelines to roll-in costs costs of facilities constructed 
under  waived blanket certificate regulations until April 30,  2002..
 
The FERC did NOT find it  appropriate to provide a greater rate of return for 
pipelines into the western  US.  The FERC stated that the demand in the 
Western US market is an  adequate rate incentive for the short term.  In 
addition, there are other  rate incentives, according to FERC, albeit more of 
a long-term nature, in  esistence and at the disposal of the pipelines that 
deliver gas in the  WSCC.  Pipelines have the right to propose market-based 
or negotiated  rates.  Pipelines can propose incentive rates.  In addition, 
pipelines  can design incremental rates for projects which propose rates of 
return and  depreciaiton rates that differ from those used on a system wide  
basis.
 
The areas of interest to  the pipeline industry are highlighted on pp. 29-38 
of the attached  order.

As you may know, the translation of the In-City price cap from ICAP to UCAP
is a pending item from the proposed ICAP Manual. The ICAP Working Group
concluded at its last meeting that, if the parties could not agree upon a
translation number, the matter should be taken to FERC for a decision.

FERC Staff has agreed that FERC will take up the issue if no consensus is
reached. Alternative positions on the translation issue will be laid out in
the cover letter to the Tariff filing; comments from any party interested in
filing on the translation issue would be due ten business days after the ISO
files the proposed Tariff. The attached motion seeks approval for this

$2500 each. With other associated materials and Clayton's labor we're looking 
at about $10,000 to replace the three pumps. The plan was, and still is, to 
install this type of pump in several wells at the Roswell site when we go to 
full-scale implementation of the remediation system, so all we're doing here 
is accelerating the purchase of three pumps. In regard to the Marshalk pumps, 
I'd rather not use them anywhere else because they are so maintenance

we're better off buying the newer pumps.

Subject: Roswell Station Remediation - Recovery System

The recovery system continues to produce too much water in spite of using 
product skimmers attached to the pumps. The problem is that product is 
forming an emulsion with water and the emulsion is recovered by the skimmers. 
Unfortunately the emulsion is more water than product. I believe this problem 
can be eliminated by using a different type of pump. The current pump system, 
manufactured by Marshalk, uses air to displace the product from the pump. We 
have been using a bladder pump fitted with a skimmer attachment, manufactured 
by Clean Environment Equipment, at Bell Lake and at Ivanhoe with very good 
success (and no emulsion problems). I have ordered three replacement pumps 
and skimmers (CEE GNE-24) to replace the three Marshalk pumps. I will have 
Clayton shut-down the recovery system until we can install the replacement 
pumps. This should take about 3-4 weeks.

Some feed back so far...... There appears to be a problem brewing with the
planned implementation of the May 29 adjustment that removes the $20K bias 
from
the DAM external transactions.I am awaiting a call back on my concerns from 
the
NYISO. By occasionally settling hourly prices through BME or occasionally
settling after SCD sets RT prices, depending on the extistence or non 
existence
of congestion, a problem that we thought we fixed many months ago will 
reappear
with the removal of the $20K bias.Here is an example of my musings....

DAM bid gets accepted at  $50 ( Import from PJM)  .....  BME  then runs (No
constraints)  evaluating the import HAM bids and other items that have
BMEprovide a $40 price.... DAM gets cut  , looks like  a $10 profit  ( 
providing
your loss in PJM doesn't exceed $10) . Due to in hour operations the RT price
clears at $60. You loooooooose!!  Sound familiar? After getting beat up like
this the MP's went through the committee structure and had the $20,000 adder
used for DAM (except IS+) to protect against this. The clearing at BME for all
external  proxy busses removed the problem so the $20,000 adder was removed. 
Now
the external interfaces only clear at BME if they are constrained. Are we 
taking
a huge step back on purpose or was there a mistake in implementation?

I have not had any response to questions about whether Don is right
about NYISO simply going back to the way things were, but making that
assumption, I offer the following solution:

In my mind the way the market should work is that there should be ""bid
guarantees"" in real time.  I do not agree with the fact that there are
production cost guarantees and not sink price cost guarantees.  If there
were guarantees to all HAM bids, that would in turn lead to a more
efficient northeastern marketplace.

An example of an export:

I bid in the DAM to export power from NYISO to PJM. I bid 50, DAM clears
40, so get accepted to export 100 mw's.  Before the HAM commitments take
place, prices in NYISO are 200 while prices in PJM are 20, so I decide
it would be economical to leave the power in NYISO.  I have the ability
to change the HAM bid created from my accepted DAM bid, so I change the
bid to 100...saying that if NYISO is willing to pay 100, then I am
willing to cut my schedule to PJM...NYISO is forecasting 200, so they
cut my schedule.  One of two things happens now, if realtime clears
above my 100 HAM bid, then I buy at 40(DAM) and sell at realtime...If
realtime clears at under my 100 HAM bid, then NYISO needs to provide the
difference between my HAM bid and the realtime px.  The logic here is
that in effect, I already owned power at 40(just like a 40 generator)
and was willing to sell back my ""generator"" at 100, so if someone
commits my generator at 100, then they should be responsible for
compensating me.

An example of an import:

I bid into the DAM to import power to NYISO from PJM.  I bid 50, DAM
clears 60, so I get accepted to import 100 mw's.  Before the HAM
evaluation, prices in PJM are 200 while prices in NYISO are 30.  So I go
into my HAM bid and change the price from 50 to 150...HAM predicts 30,
cuts my import...thereby I am selling the power at 60, and buying it
back real time...once again two things can occur here...realtime clears
under my 150 bid, so I sell 60(DAM) and buy realtime....or realtime
clears at over my bid...in which case I sell 60(DAM) and buy back at my
150 HAM bid....the logic here is that my power at PJM(my generator)
which had committed itself at 60 in the DAM, was willing to stay flowing
to NYISO at up to 150(my HAM bid)...ie I am willing to take the
financial risk between 60 and 150....NYISO did not commit me in HAM, so
my financial risk should be capped at what I am willing to risk, not
what NYISO says I should be willing to risk

Subject: $20,000 DAM adder



barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Some feed back so far...... There appears to be a problem brewing with
the
planned implementation of the May 29 adjustment that removes the $20K
bias from
the DAM external transactions.I am awaiting a call back on my concerns
from the
NYISO. By occasionally settling hourly prices through BME or
occasionally
settling after SCD sets RT prices, depending on the extistence or non
existence
of congestion, a problem that we thought we fixed many months ago will
reappear
with the removal of the $20K bias.Here is an example of my musings....

DAM bid gets accepted at  $50 ( Import from PJM)  .....  BME  then runs
(No
constraints)  evaluating the import HAM bids and other items that have
BMEprovide a $40 price.... DAM gets cut  , looks like  a $10 profit  (
providing
your loss in PJM doesn't exceed $10) . Due to in hour operations the RT
price
clears at $60. You loooooooose!!  Sound familiar? After getting beat up
like
this the MP's went through the committee structure and had the $20,000
adder
used for DAM (except IS+) to protect against this. The clearing at BME
for all
external  proxy busses removed the problem so the $20,000 adder was
removed. Now
the external interfaces only clear at BME if they are constrained. Are
we taking
a huge step back on purpose or was there a mistake in implementation?

Last month I produced a BAWG Status Report presentation for the April 24,
2001 BIC meeting but unfortunately was not able to give that presentation
""in-person"" because of a scheduling conflict with a sub-working group
meeting to discuss metering for the EDRP.  This status report is available
on the NYISO Web Site under April 24 BIC Meeting Materials and it is my
understanding that Garry Brown directed market participants to read that
presentation and contact Wes Yeomans or attend a BAWG meeting with
questions.

The last slide in that presentation did require action from the BIC
pertaining to direction on what to use for generation payments when the
NYISO orders a generator on line but the generator bid price expired.
Attached please find the last slide from the April 24, 2001 presentation.
I will be available by conference call on May 24 at 3:00 PM to lead the
discussion on this issue.

Subject: New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Certainly the problem Don identified is legitimate and can still occur.
However, with the implementation of the ECAs we have seen a change in
bidding behavior at the interfaces - HAMs no longer bid at or near the caps.
Thus, by changing HAM prices of accepted DAM transactions to something like
+/- $500, you can be reasonably sure your transaction will flow.  If it
doesn't you may be far better off that it didn't.

The big concern I have with this is that it can again lead to huge
scheduling problems with neighboring control areas (once DAMs and HAMs are
all competing for the same space).  How is the ISO planning on better
coordinating with its neighbors - will lead times on accepted transactions
change?  Does the ISO have any comments?  Do we remember the letters that
were received from PJM - and can we afford scheduling snafus going into the
summer?",Non Abusive

Ray,
What if you want your transaction to be cut if the economics support it? You
change your DAM ( or leave it at the original bid) to a price sensitive bid 
and
the BME promises you that price you wanted in your bid, then SCD runs and the
real time (no constraints thus no BME clearing) runs up due operational
restrictions and the price you get clobbers you? Like it did before the $20 K
adder. All these problems would go away if the BME clearing at the Proxy
busses,passed by BIC and MC ,was implemented. Baby-sitting your DAM bids would
solve the "" schedule and forget deal"" but if you have any arb or price 
sensitive
schedules then you run into the risk above.  Given the apparent limitations of
the NYISO (software ?) we might have to pick and choose which band aid 
approach
is more palatable.

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Don,

There is no question you are right - this can happen.  You also know in
trading there is no transaction without risk (especially in NY).  Do you
trust the ISO and their software to effectively implement a whole new
settlement?  You may also be aware of some of the gaming opportunities that
arose when they looked into implementing the BME settlement.  The proposed
solution seems to eliminate most of the gaming, and yes, shifts more risk
over to the market participant.  Sometimes we have to take the bad with the
fair.  The 20k adder didn't fix anything - it only gave DAM transactions a
higher priority - if you want that security it is still open to you.  All
this does is give you the option to have the ISO evaluate your transaction
again the real-time . . . like any option, you don't have to exercise it.


Good luck,

the

All other non-Skill Based Pay employees will be evaluated using the current=
=20
GPG performance criteria and performance levels within their respective=20
company or business unit.  This will not be an excelr-wide activity.   =20

For directors or director-equivalent employees there will be an additional=
=20
step, which will be a GPG-wide cross-calibration by the GPG Management=20
Committee in early December.=20

We are taking a more focused look at performance.  In our efforts to=20
challenge a well-performing organization to achieve an even higher level of=
=20
performance, we are establishing the following distribution as a guideline:

Level 1 - Consistently Exceeds Expectations  10%
Level 2 - Often Exceeds Expectations  30%
Level 3 - Meets Expectations   50%
Level 4 - Needs Improvement and
Level 5 - Seldom Meets Expectations  10%=20

In the case of non-Skill Based Pay team employees in Operations, this proce=

effort to strive for the top level of performance in our industry.   I want=

to be clear that we have raised our performance expectations for the compan=

as well as for individuals.=20

Variable pay and merit increases will be impacted by these changes as well.=
 =20
GPG will use market data, job grade and individual and company performance =

Subject: NNG Gomez Water Disposal

I began discussions regarding this issue with Sonny, an employee of Cliffwood 
Oil & Gas, operator of the Ft. Stockton Unit Water Station. This is the 
outfit that was taking our recovered groundwater. Sonny discussed this with 
Cliffwoods' reservoir engineers in Houston and they decided they did not want 
to accept this water regardless of permit status due to their concern that 
the relatively fresh water may cause calcium carbonate to precipitate in the 
disposal well perforations and plug up their well. 

Lee Cisneros of 4C Construction, the outfit hauling the recovered water, put 
me in touch with Kenneth McIntyre of Stockton Water Inc. Kenneth informed me 
that they would accept the water if permit condition would allow it. Kenneth 
said they would dispose of the water in one of two wells, their University 
165 or RS Pershing Well#1. 

This afternoon I discussed the issue of disposal of recovered water with 
Doris at the TRC District 8 office. Doris looked up the permit for these two 
wells and informed me that they were permitted for produced water only. After 
further discussion of the situation she transferred my call Mark Henkhaus, 
District 8 Director. Mark said that normally this waste stream would go to an 
""oil and gas waste"" disposal facility as you had pointed out in our meeting 
last week, but suggested an alternative. Mark suggested that I obtain a 
letter of no objection from the operator of the SWD disposal well and 
transmit the letter with a request for approval from his office to dispose of 
the recovered water in the SWD disposal well for a period not to exceed 12 
months. He said he will issue an approval for such a request.

I think this will be the most cost effective manner to manage recovered water 
over the next few months, particularly if recovery operations continue to 
proceed as favorably as they have to date and we can cease active remediation 
activities toward the latter part of this year. If you concur, I will obtain 
the letter from the disposal well operator and submit the request to the TRC.

Water Disposal:  The current rate of water production has been established as 
a compromise between what we think is most effective for removing PSH and 
what we think are reasonable disposal costs. Our objective is to flush out 
PSH that is trapped in dissolution channels and fractures in the aquifer. 
Dewatering is not an objective because the shallow aquifer is too prolific a 
producer. In an effort to flush out trapped PSH we pump 200 bbls of 
groundwater twice weekly (or 1600 bbl per month). In addition we manually 
remove any accumulated PSH from recovery wells that do not have pumps in 
them. Pumping 200 bbls per cycle takes about 24 hours and is adequate to 
create a significant drawdown of the aquifer in the immediate vicinity of the 
former pit area. The aquifer will recharge within 24 hours, but we don't 
start another cycle until after about 60 hours in order to limit the number 
of cycles to two per week. The number of cycles is limited to two per week 
primarily for cost considerations, but also because our minor permit 
specifies a maximum disposal rate of 400 bbl per week. If we were to limit 
the number of cycles to one per week we would drop our PSH removal efficiency 
by nearly 50%; likewise, if we were to increase the number of cycles to four 
per week we would increase our removal efficiency by nearly 100%. Note that 
beyond about four cycles per week, there will be a deminishing advantage to 
increasing the number of cycles due to the time it takes to draw down the 
aquifer and the time it takes for the aquifer to recharge. Cycling the pumps 
twice per week also fits well into our O&M schedule for other sites in the 
area. We are spending about $3,200 per month for O&M at this site, about 
$1,800 per month on water disposal and $1,400 for O&M labor. These costs are 
directly proportional to the number of cycles per week that we operate the 
pumps. In regard to the effectiveness of this scheme, we have seen some 
positive indications in both a reduction of accumulated PSH in the former pit 
area recovery wells and a decrease in dissolved phase contaminants at monitor 
wells downgradient from the former pit area. An exception to this is the 
accumulation of PSH from what appears to be another source located west of 
the former pit area. This issue is being addressed by the installation of 
additional recovery wells. Another note regarding water disposal, we had 
briefly discussed the possibility of irrigating produced water rather than 
hauling it. We temporarily dismissed this idea over concern that arsenic 
contained in groundwater might accumulate in surface soil as a result of 
irrigation. We should revisit this idea next spring if it appears that 
pumping will continue much longer.

Monitor Wells:  Although the additional wells that we have planned should 
adequately delineate the dissolved phase plume, I am reluctant to think that 
these will be the last. The TRC recently rejected closure requests for about 
a half-dozen ENA sites. In a recent meeting between the TRC and David Ayers 
(for ENA), the TRC requested that ENA return to the sites and delineate 
dissolved phase contaminant plumes to MCL concentrations. Although the TRC 
has not yet made that request for this site, it is certainly a possibility. 
This is also consistent with recent draft guidance documents prepared by the 
TRC that specifies plume delineation to MCL concentrations. Currently, 
arsenic is the only contaminant in groundwater that is not delineated to MCL 
concentrations, more specifically, downgradient and east of the release area. 
We will have to wait and see what results we get from the new wells before we 
have a better idea whether any additional wells may someday be required. 

Recovery Wells:  This is totally dependent on what we find with the 
additional recovery wells. I suspect that we are going to confirm a separate 
source of PSH and will require additional wells to adequately remove PSH.

IF there is no increase in emissions, this is probably not a modification
and the Grandfathered status would remain.  They would need to demonstrate
that there is no change.  This could require testing before and after the
change.

Hi Jon,
This is a joint Duncan - Jim Linville reply.
First, for all intents and purposes, expect GF status to go away when the
legislature comes back to town.  With that in mind, what exactly is
happening with this engine.  Does the carburetor replace the mixer valves?
 If so, this must be one ancient engine!  And unlikely to get in under VERP
or any other program designed to end GF status.  Tell us more.

Duncan,
I have some grandfathered gas compressor engines in west Texas.  We are
going to change out the old mixer valves and install carburetors on the
units as a maintenance activity.  Horsepower and emissions will not
increase.  I can maintain my grandfathered status, correct?  We will of
course document this activity and provide copies to the regional office.

Operating Permits - TNRCC is attempting to obtain EPA approval of their Title 
V operating permit program by including Minor New Source Review (NSR) (e.g., 
permits by rule) in the operating permit program. The TNRCC idea is that you 
would make changes or install equipment under a permit by rule as you do now 
under current rules. When your Title V permit is renewed, all Minor NSR 
approvals would be rolled into the permit and included in the renewed permit. 
They are also putting together a General Operating Permit (GOP) that would 
include Minor NSR. It is unknown if EPA will buy this concept.

Upset and Maintenance - A general note: The TNRCC field offices are giving 
different answers to questions that have been asked by industry about the new 
upset and maintenance rules. 

When reporting upset emissions, TNRCC wants you to report all pollutants, not 
just the ones that exceeded the RQs;
It is important to give as much detail as possible on the cause of an upset. 
""Operator error"" is not acceptable to TNRCC and may make it more likely you 
will be investigated by TNRCC if you repeatedly give this as a cause since it 
may appear to the agency that this is a repeat problem that a company is not 
correcting;
TNRCC's Region 12 (Houston Area) is conducting inspections at 20 facilities 
specifically directed at upset notifications. The inspections take about two 
days. Companies are inspected if they make too many upset notifications or 
too few.
When reporting a release of natural gas (unspeciated), you should exclude 
methane and ethane from the reporting and calculation of determining the 
5,000 pound threshold, but according to TNRCC you cannot exclude CO2 or N2;
If you do speciate a release, remember that heptane and nonane are not listed 
pollutants so they default to a 100 pound RQ.

New Source Review - TNRCC has lifted their hold on NSR permits in the Houston 
non-attainment area, but if there are too many permit applications between 
now and December 6 (to beat the new non-attainment regulations that should 
pass on December 6) there is a chance that they will put another hold on 
permits.

EPA Enforcement Priorities - EPA has proposed their enforcement priorities 
for Fiscal Year 2002-3 and they include ""fuels management"". Fuels management 
is broadly defined to include many industries and includes pipelines. It is 
not believed that this directive is aimed at gas pipelines, but it is broad 
enough to include them.

question to him of whether it was necessary to notify the agency of 
mechanical and maintenace activities which  will not impact or change a

as long as the engines operating parameters would not change, ( horsepower, 
emissions, throughput, fuel use etc), and the burden of responsibility will 
rest on Transwestern to ensure that no permit conditions are violated, he 
stated that we may proceed with these types of activities in Arizona without 
any notification to the agency.   

The only hitch being, that when Transwestern does a major mechanical 
activity, which would cost more than  25-30% of the cost of replacing a unit, 
that we provide them a courtesy notification.  I told them we would apprise

Subject: TW N. Crawar Remediation

Lou,

In advance of installing several off-site wells for a remediation system at 
the N. Crawar site, Roger Westbrook has contacted the property owner in order 
to obtain off-site access for the installation of wells and other associated 
activities. I believe Roger offered $2500 for a five year term. The property 
owner has indicated that Duke Energy (the current facility owner) has 
indicated that Duke plans to release the property lease since they no longer 
utilize this facility. Furthermore, the property owner has put off entering 
into an access agreement with TW pending further information regarding Duke's 
plans for the lease. Roger suspects that the property owner wants more for 
damages to replace the lost revenue that was generated by the lease. This 
brings up the following questions. Does Duke have an obligation to maintain 
the lease until TW is done with remediation activities? If Duke releases the 
lease, does TW need to obtain a lease for remediation activities? 

Another issue related to this site. The property owner asked Roger about the 
quantity of water that would be recovered in the course of remediation at 
this site. Apparently the town of Crane, Texas owns the water rights in this 
area and has a pending suit against Chevron and the property owner for 
contamination of the aquifer. I have noticed several monitor wells in the 
area just east and northeast of the TW site. These wells are spaced out over 
quite a large area. My best guess would be that Chevron had a problem with 
one or more injection wells to create such a widespread problem. We've got 
good monitoring data that shows that the lateral extent of affected 
groundwater at the TW site is very limited. Do we run the risk of getting 
pulled into something bigger just for being there? Is this an issue that 
needs to be investigated further? Last year sometime I asked someone at the 
RRC District 8 office about the Chevron monitor wells and they were not 
familiar with them.

I would like to know the results of such a test.  However, before I say ""go 
for it"" I would like to know how Mr. Soldano feels about it.  He has a better

Subject: Kern River Tank Sampling

John and Lou,

As we discussed during our trip to the airport from the SoCal PCB meeting, I 
had mentioned that I would like to show up at the PG&E's Kern River I/C tank 
and do some liquids sampling.  Is this still a go?  I have discussed this 
with Randy Williams of our Needles team and I have requested that he found 
out the driving directions to the tank from someone on PG&E, particularily 
from someone at their Topock C/S.  I have asked him to casually ask for this 
and not make an issue of it.  Because the field probably is more layed back 
about this kind of stuff and not in the political center, it seemed like the 
right thing to do and would not raise any flags to PG&E.  

Let me know if you want me to proceed......

Subject: Environmental Notice

Attached for your review are the technical version and summary version of 
Environmental Notices on the revised Texas upset and maintenance reporting 
rules. The rules were passed this summer so this is a bit late getting out, 
but as you know I was in Puerto Rico at the time.

I am still trying to get clarification from TNRCC on their basis for 
requiring you to include Nitrogen and CO2 when determining the Reporting 
Quantity (RQ) for natural gas. I don't believe this is a very important issue 
at most locations but I am not sure TNRCC is correct on this issue. Your 
thoughts on this are welcome.

If you could provide comments by November 29 it would be appreciated. Since I 
am not up on all the ETS organizational changes, help with the distribution 
list would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Marc

Bakersfield facilities due to Gary's departure.  They were concerned because 
of the numerous visits by state regulatory personnel conducting unnounced 
onsite inspections and the fact that EOTT may not have an onsite 
environmental representative.  They were highly complementary of Gary and 
were aware of the good repoire he had established with the agencies and they 
felt they would be losing this repoire and credibility if his position was 
not filled with a person located in Bakersfield.  As a courtesy to our

accepting a position with a bakersfield consulting company which specializes

 I understand that there is some environmental sensitivity in California that

alleviate much of the existing workload.  What the employees can't handle or 
issues that are above the skill base pay level requirements, can be handled

Gary as a technical contact living in Bakersfield will satisify EOTT's 
concern of having an environmental expert  available for those times when 
agencies arrive unnounced and  at the same time give EOTT the comfort and 
security that they want by knowing that they will be represented by a person 
of Gary's reputation and character. 

In line with this, there appears to be a larger workload and work area in 
MIdland rather than in Bakersfield.  Remediation activites, permitting and

Northern faciltiies which comprise the Midland area.  In this area, there are 
approximately 13 field teams to provide technical assistance and training

am asking Bill (by copy of this email) to work with Lou and come up with a 
list of the names of folks that we should visit with prior to formerly

I have a slight dilema.  Are you working a site by the name of:

The Austin office indicates we took in to our reception a report on May 7,

Subject: 2001 Domestic Audit Calendar

Attached for your information and planning is the projected ETS audit 
calendar for 2001.  As you can see there are a few changes in the calendar 
for next year. This year we welcome Don Bruce to the audit program.  Don 
joins excelr Quality Management from the EOTT organization as an additional 
Audit Director.  As can be seen, we have blended the EOTT assets into the ETS 
calendar.  Next year ETS will be going to a four year rotation for auditing 
team assets therefore, we have scheduled and will be conducting forty-two 
domestic audits.  

Major changes are also happening within our program design for 2001. First, 
five unannounced audits will be conducted giving management a picture of how 
well the assets are being operated on a day to day basis.   Also, new to the 
program this year, the  audits conducted by our audit teams will be scored .  
In January we are introducing a new electronic format to the audit process.  
This new computerized program should greatly enhance the audit process by 
giving EQM the capability of:

Producing enhanced audit reports
Generating site specific verification points (formally questions)
Producing statistical graphs and data
Scoring by category or total audit 
Increasing objectivity
Generating historical data for review

excelr Quality Management is enthuastically looking forward to 2001and the 
progressive program that we have outlined to help ensure ""quality management"" 
of our gas and liquid facilities.  During this holiday season we would like 
to take this opportunity to extend to each of you and your families the 
happiest of holidays and a progressive and prosperous new year.

have spoken to the agency inspector about one of the NOV issues and have been 
told that EOTT will definately receive a an NOV and fine for failure to 
conduct the emissions testing on a heater that apparently should have been 
tested approx. 6 months ago.  With repsect to the other NOV issue, Rick 
Suderman had a testing company in to perform emissions testing on another 
heater which was required to be tested by today.  As the testing contractor 
began his testing, an 02 issue developed with the equipment the testing 
company was using and a miscommunication on the part of the testing 
contractor was directed to Rick.  As a result,  the  the inspector observed 
elevated CO readings from the heater that  Rick had made adjustments in the 
heater set points (based upon recommendations from the contractor) causing 
the elevated CO readings to result.  The inspector stated that the facility 
would receive another NOV for this exceedance.   In any event this isssue was 
NOT Rick's fault and was due to some bad communication on the part of the 
contractor.  We have sent the testing company home and will be bringing in 
another testing company (AEROS) on thursday.  This is the contractor who has 
done the majority of the previous emissions testing for the facility to 
complete the heater testing and substantiate the innaccuracy of the first 
testing company's data.  With this new data, we shold be able to demonstrate 
inaccuracy in the first testing company's QA/QC.

It should also be mentioned that we have identified other environmental 
issues which we should discuss at your convenience.  Butch and I will have 
completed the permit compliance investigataion and be available for 
discussions on friday.

Larry Campbell is going to Bakersfield this  week to address the situation.  
I have asked him to put together a compliance calendar for the Bakersfield 
facility outlining regulatory deadlines required by the permits and 
regulations.  He has discussed the testing due on one of the heaters this 
week with the regulators and there does not appear to be an issue.  It is my 
understanding that the heater will be performed this week.  Larry will look 
into the best course of action necessary to address the engine testing that 
was apparently missed last year.  He will be discussing the matter with 
Gary.   Please call with any questions.

Subject: Environmental -- NCL


     I just spoke with Gary Fuller who informed me that we have been
notified by the Air District that we are getting an NOV for missing a
source test in December (apparently on one of our IC engines.)  Now, while
this is not the end of the world, we put ourselves at potential risk if we
do not follow up properly -- especially given the history of this plant
with this Air District (that is, the Koch troubles that resulted in a
criminal investigation from some relatively minor problems, really.)

     In fact, I believe that if we act promptly and conduct the source test
now we stand a very good chance of having this NOV rescinded.  But we must
act.  I am please to see that we still have Gary on the job, and I hope he
can follow through with this.  I have asked him to do so, and also to
handle reporting of the soil contamination at NCL that we have all
discussed at length.  I have done so because delay works against us on both
of these issues.  Gary, though, is somewhat reluctant to act without
instruction directly from ETS (which is understandable, given that ETS runs
things.)   He seems to feel that he should be getting direction from Cutty
Cunningham, although I must confess I don't know enough yet about the
structure of ETS to know why this is the case.

     In any event, I asked Gary to talk to whomever he needed to, but these
matters needed to be handled in the short run.  Obviously, we will discuss
next week what is to be done for the long run.  In the meantime, I would
greatly appreciate whatever you folks can do to help grease the wheels to
make Gary feel he has authority to act to get these more immediate problems
addressed.  Thanks a bunch.

 I certainly don't want to jump to any conclusions, but I am concerned that 
this may be yet another item that just dropped from the radar screen once

servicing the assets out here two other things:  first, Kenny Maltby of ETS 
Bakersfield is our designated ""representative responsible for communications 
with the Department and for overseeing compliance with th[e Take permit]"", as 
specified in section 5.1 of the permit.  (Kenny and I are really the only 
personnel in California who are aware of the Permit and its requirements.)  

 Second, various sections of the permit require use of "" a knowledgeable, 
experienced biologist.""   (See e.g., Section 5.4.)  We have been using a 
biologist in Bakersfield, Randi McCormick, for this purpose for years.  I 
strongly urge we continue to use her because she knows our operations, knows 
our people, knows our contractors, knows our habitat, knows our permit 
conditions, has good relations/credibility  with Cal. Fish and Game and US 
Fish and Wildlife, and has always been reasonable with and responsive to us.  
I would like to get her on a contract wth ETS.

 Lastly, I am getting more eager to see and discuss the results of the audit 
now after your statements regarding the credibility of the sampling in the 
1997 ""baseline"" study done by WZI.  (It's a very interesting issue for many 
reasons, which I'll spare going into here; obviously, the crux of my concern 
is that it may not be much of a baseline at all.)  So, I would like to have 
some input into the question of how ""resampling"" would be done, if possible, 
because of the Koch indemnification issues presented.  So please be sure that 
your enviro folks remember our EOTT company motto: ""Call Before you Dig!""

 Again, good seeing you and the crew, and I look forward to talking about 
these and other issues again real soon.  In particular, if there's any other

Maybe you didn't forward the copy of the Arco USFWS ITP on to Lou (which was 
sent on to me), regardless what I have in my possession is entitled ""US Fish 
and Wildlife service - Incidental Take Permit No. 809228"",dated 3/1/96 and

and I am grateful to whomever sent it my way.  I do appreciate your relating 
the chain of custody of the federal permit for the North Coles Levee 
Ecosystem Preserve (NCLEP).   Thanks also for sending Randi's phone numbers.  

I would appreciate a copy of the CDFG permit that has been assigned to EOTT

relates to only state rare, threatened and endangered species or does it also 
cover the federally listed species?  Are there any species of ""concern"" that 
the CDFG are working with within the easement boundaries beyond those 
officially listed?  Do you have a contact with the California Natural 
Heritage Program, California Natural Diversity Database (within the 
Califormia Dept. of Fish & Game) that you have been visiting with about the 
NCLEP?

you and others is that Kenny plainly told me that he has no comprehensive 
knowledge about the permit and the requirements of the permit.  He said he 
relies on you and Randi McCormick for that.  Your attempt to ""stop-gap"" (with 
Kenny since Gary had departed) to ensure representation in the field for the 
CDFG is understood.  I will want to further discuss with you the need to 
possibly have more people knowledgeable in the matters of the permit and 
involved in the execution of the same with the CDFG.

Subject: Re: NCL Preserve History - Bakersfield  

 I don't believe I sent you the Arco USFWS ITP.   No federal take permit was 
ever assigned to EOTT by Koch because Koch represented that it did not have 
such a permit; rather, it purportedly was having discussions with USFWS re 
this issue pending at the time of the asset sale to EOTT.   As I understand 
it, any such federal permit was not assigned by Arco to Koch, for whatever 
reason and, consequently, EOTT ended up not having a federal permit assigned 
to it by Koch.  Instead, we took over the application process from Koch.  
That application is still pending.

 The permit from which I quoted in the email was the California Department of 
Fish and Game ITP between CDFG and Koch, which was assigned to EOTT in 
connection with the asset purchase.  I'll be happy to send you a copy, along 
with a copy of the Conservation Easement that is referenced in my last email.

 Regarding Kenny Maltby, the short answer is, of course, ETS can -- and 
indeed should -- designate whomever it thinks best to be the ""representative 
responsible for communications with the [CDFG] and for oversing the 
compliance with the take permit.""   But, as of last Wednesday, the designated 
representative was Gary Fuller.  Matt Hughes, et al, informed me that they 
wanted to begin construction on the Rogas Line by February 1, and possibly as 
early as January 23.  Consequently, a new representative had to be named on 
short order (in fact, the permit technically requires such notice 30 days in 
advance of ""ground disturbing activities.""  While the CDFG will cut us some 
slack in view of Gary's departure, that indulgence is probably not 
limitless.)   

 I continue to believe that Kenny M was the only logical choice.  While I 
believe Rick Suderman and Scott Jones specifically (and all plant employees 
generally) are aware of the habitat and a number of the operational issues 
covered by the take permit, I believe Kenny has a more comprehensive 
knowledge of the permit requirements in their entirety (including 
preconstruction and construction measures, and compensation acreage 
requirements), as well as how they apply to pipeline construction generally 
and this project specifically.  (I tend to think that Kenny's ""warm body"" 
comment is more a reflection of his modesty than the intent here: in fact, I 
thought of Kenny only because I did not want just a warm body appointed.)  
Simply put, I was attempting a stop-gap measure to ensure that this specific 
project got off the ground on ETS's own schedule; I was in no way attempting 
to dictate who would be the representative for the long term.  

 Randi McCormick's phone is 661-589-4065, and her fax is 661-619-0372.

 If you need anything else, please let me know.

Ed,
Lou forwarded your email on to me and I appreciate getting it.  The 
information I received (I assume from you) is actually a copy of a USFWS 
Incidental Take Permit (ITP), dated 3/1/96 which is related to a ""Habitat 
Conservation Plan"" (HCP) covering a portion of the San Joaquin Valley floor 
in Kern County, CA.  The permittee is shown as Arco Western Energy.  I am 
assuming that the ITP was transferred to Koch and then subsequently to EOTT 
as those property sales consummated.  In order to more fully understand how 
this permit relates to the EOTT facilities, could I obtain a copy of the 
permit from which you are quoting in your email (I don't find those sections 
or quotes in the copy Lou forwarded)?    

I found a paragraph very interesting in your email relating that ""Kenny 
Maltby"" is the designated ""representative responsible for communications with 
the California Department of Fish and Game and for overseeing the compliance 
with the 'take permit'"" and that the two of you are the only personnel in 
California who are aware of the Permit and its requirements.   It is my 
understanding that Kenny reports into Randy Rice's organization and works for 
Rich Jolly.  I believe that Kenny was only designated last Friday, by a 
letter mailed to California Game and Fish as such a representative and in his 
own words he is: ""a warm body for the California Game and Fish to contact 
related to the permit.""   I have no problem with Kenny being a contact during 
the pipeline construction in the area, but may want to make some further 
changes on contacts as we learn more about the Conservation Easement and its 
restrictions.

I recall, that Randi McCormick was the CWB being used for work in the 
Conservation Area and I plan to give her a call.  By the way, can you please 
furnish her phone number for me. 

Again, please furnish a more complete copy of the permit and any other 
information that might explain more fully the easement and its requirements.  

Thanks, John

Please let me know if you don't receive them by Friday.  

 You are quite right that the State Permit covers only state rare, threatened 
and endangered species.  However, with the sole exception of the San Joaquin 
Antelope Squirrel (which is state listed only), all state listed animal 
species are federally listed as well.  (Though the lists are virtually 
identical, the ""rankings"" on each list are not; that is, a species considered 
""endangered"" by the state may only be considered ""threatened"" by the feds, 
and vice-versa,etc.)  Listed species of plant, on the other hand, are not the 
same federally and state.  Plus, there indeed are species of concern within 
the easement that are not yet listed.  Randi McCormick has some pretty 
comprehensive listings on both of these points (that is, lists of federally 
and state rare, threatened and endangered species of plants; and species of 
concern.)  I'll have her send info on this to you.  Lastly, I don't have a 
contact with the State Database folks, and I don't think we've ever dealt 
with them.

 I apologize if I seemed argumentative about Kenny -- I wasn't meaning to 
be.  I just wanted you to understand how and why that designation came 
about.  In any event, I would very much look forward to discussing with you 
and/or Larry, and/or whomever else you think should be involved, the habitat 
training issue, the status and further processing of our Federal Take Permit 
Application, and related topics.  Thanks. --ETA

Ed,
Maybe you didn't forward the copy of the Arco USFWS ITP on to Lou (which was 
sent on to me), regardless what I have in my possession is entitled ""US Fish 
and Wildlife service - Incidental Take Permit No. 809228"",dated 3/1/96 and 
made out to a permittee named: Arco Western Energy.  It is helpful to have it 
and I am grateful to whomever sent it my way.  I do appreciate your relating 
the chain of custody of the federal permit for the North Coles Levee 
Ecosystem Preserve (NCLEP).   Thanks also for sending Randi's phone numbers.  

I would appreciate a copy of the CDFG permit that has been assigned to EOTT 
and a copy of the Conservation Easement.  I assume that the State CDFG permit 
relates to only state rare, threatened and endangered species or does it also 
cover the federally listed species?  Are there any species of ""concern"" that 
the CDFG are working with within the easement boundaries beyond those 
officially listed?  Do you have a contact with the California Natural 
Heritage Program, California Natural Diversity Database (within the 
Califormia Dept. of Fish & Game) that you have been visiting with about the 
NCLEP? 

Again, I am not trying to argue the point about Kenny Maltby.  My point to 
you and others is that Kenny plainly told me that he has no comprehensive 
knowledge about the permit and the requirements of the permit.  He said he 
relies on you and Randi McCormick for that.  Your attempt to ""stop-gap"" (with 
Kenny since Gary had departed) to ensure representation in the field for the 
CDFG is understood.  I will want to further discuss with you the need to 
possibly have more people knowledgeable in the matters of the permit and 
involved in the execution of the same with the CDFG.

Subject: Re: NCL Preserve History - Bakersfield  

 I don't believe I sent you the Arco USFWS ITP.   No federal take permit was 
ever assigned to EOTT by Koch because Koch represented that it did not have 
such a permit; rather, it purportedly was having discussions with USFWS re 
this issue pending at the time of the asset sale to EOTT.   As I understand 
it, any such federal permit was not assigned by Arco to Koch, for whatever 
reason and, consequently, EOTT ended up not having a federal permit assigned 
to it by Koch.  Instead, we took over the application process from Koch.  
That application is still pending.

 The permit from which I quoted in the email was the California Department of 
Fish and Game ITP between CDFG and Koch, which was assigned to EOTT in 
connection with the asset purchase.  I'll be happy to send you a copy, along 
with a copy of the Conservation Easement that is referenced in my last email.

 Regarding Kenny Maltby, the short answer is, of course, ETS can -- and 
indeed should -- designate whomever it thinks best to be the ""representative 
responsible for communications with the [CDFG] and for oversing the 
compliance with the take permit.""   But, as of last Wednesday, the designated 
representative was Gary Fuller.  Matt Hughes, et al, informed me that they 
wanted to begin construction on the Rogas Line by February 1, and possibly as 
early as January 23.  Consequently, a new representative had to be named on 
short order (in fact, the permit technically requires such notice 30 days in 
advance of ""ground disturbing activities.""  While the CDFG will cut us some 
slack in view of Gary's departure, that indulgence is probably not 
limitless.)   

 I continue to believe that Kenny M was the only logical choice.  While I 
believe Rick Suderman and Scott Jones specifically (and all plant employees 
generally) are aware of the habitat and a number of the operational issues 
covered by the take permit, I believe Kenny has a more comprehensive 
knowledge of the permit requirements in their entirety (including 
preconstruction and construction measures, and compensation acreage 
requirements), as well as how they apply to pipeline construction generally 
and this project specifically.  (I tend to think that Kenny's ""warm body"" 
comment is more a reflection of his modesty than the intent here: in fact, I 
thought of Kenny only because I did not want just a warm body appointed.)  
Simply put, I was attempting a stop-gap measure to ensure that this specific 
project got off the ground on ETS's own schedule; I was in no way attempting 
to dictate who would be the representative for the long term.  

 Randi McCormick's phone is 661-589-4065, and her fax is 661-619-0372.

 If you need anything else, please let me know.  

 Thanks.  --ETA

Ed,
Lou forwarded your email on to me and I appreciate getting it.  The 
information I received (I assume from you) is actually a copy of a USFWS 
Incidental Take Permit (ITP), dated 3/1/96 which is related to a ""Habitat 
Conservation Plan"" (HCP) covering a portion of the San Joaquin Valley floor 
in Kern County, CA.  The permittee is shown as Arco Western Energy.  I am 
assuming that the ITP was transferred to Koch and then subsequently to EOTT 
as those property sales consummated.  In order to more fully understand how 
this permit relates to the EOTT facilities, could I obtain a copy of the 
permit from which you are quoting in your email (I don't find those sections 
or quotes in the copy Lou forwarded)?    

I found a paragraph very interesting in your email relating that ""Kenny 
Maltby"" is the designated ""representative responsible for communications with 
the California Department of Fish and Game and for overseeing the compliance 
with the 'take permit'"" and that the two of you are the only personnel in 
California who are aware of the Permit and its requirements.   It is my 
understanding that Kenny reports into Randy Rice's organization and works for 
Rich Jolly.  I believe that Kenny was only designated last Friday, by a 
letter mailed to California Game and Fish as such a representative and in his 
own words he is: ""a warm body for the California Game and Fish to contact 
related to the permit.""   I have no problem with Kenny being a contact during 
the pipeline construction in the area, but may want to make some further 
changes on contacts as we learn more about the Conservation Easement and its 
restrictions.

I recall, that Randi McCormick was the CWB being used for work in the 
Conservation Area and I plan to give her a call.  By the way, can you please 
furnish her phone number for me. 

Again, please furnish a more complete copy of the permit and any other 
information that might explain more fully the easement and its requirements.  

Thanks, John

I hope you have been reading the emails below related to the NCLP in which 
the Bakersfield plant is located.  I think ""Ed"" (the EOTT lawyer) has 
realized that he's not going to ""buffalo me"" on any of these issues and will 
begin to openly share information and support my decision making on what we 
might be able to do there proactively.  Some things I will be doing are: (1) 
calling Randi McCormick the CWB in California who reportedly has more 
knowledge about the NCLP than anyone else.  I will be setting a meeting with 
her (probably at her office or wherever she keeps all of the records, maps, 
etc. on the preserve), so she might brief me on the NCLP and the restrictions 
that she believes EOTT is operating under with the HCP.  (2) I am placing 
calls to the Nature Conservancy in California to see what they know about the 
preserve (incidentally, the Steven McCormick, executive director of the 
California Chapter of TNC has been named the new President of the Nature 
Conservancy, succeeding the late John Sawhill).  I may give him a call and 
see who he recommends that I call in California to get the inside scoop on 
the North Coles Levee Preserve.  (3) I will make several other calls 
gathering information.  You need to: (1) begin talking with Scott Jones and 
Rick Sudderman to learn all you can from their perspective about the easement 
and the preserve. (2) be available to meet with me and Randi when I get a 
meeting set, (3) begin assisting my efforts to develop a proactive plan 
related to EOTT's involvement in the NCLP.

As always, thanks for your support.  John

Subject: Re: NCL Preserve History - Bakersfield  

 The State Take Permit and the Consevation Easement were mailed yesterday.  
Please let me know if you don't receive them by Friday.  

 You are quite right that the State Permit covers only state rare, threatened 
and endangered species.  However, with the sole exception of the San Joaquin 
Antelope Squirrel (which is state listed only), all state listed animal 
species are federally listed as well.  (Though the lists are virtually 
identical, the ""rankings"" on each list are not; that is, a species considered 
""endangered"" by the state may only be considered ""threatened"" by the feds, 
and vice-versa,etc.)  Listed species of plant, on the other hand, are not the 
same federally and state.  Plus, there indeed are species of concern within 
the easement that are not yet listed.  Randi McCormick has some pretty 
comprehensive listings on both of these points (that is, lists of federally 
and state rare, threatened and endangered species of plants; and species of 
concern.)  I'll have her send info on this to you.  Lastly, I don't have a 
contact with the State Database folks, and I don't think we've ever dealt 
with them.

 I apologize if I seemed argumentative about Kenny -- I wasn't meaning to 
be.  I just wanted you to understand how and why that designation came 
about.  In any event, I would very much look forward to discussing with you 
and/or Larry, and/or whomever else you think should be involved, the habitat 
training issue, the status and further processing of our Federal Take Permit 
Application, and related topics.  Thanks. --ETA

44194,campbell-l/all_documents/245.,<3722944.1075851883437.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.",Non Abusive

I contacted John Sailane with Invatech responding to his call to Dr. 
Terraso. 

The material is a polyurethane foam used to fill pipes that are being 
abandoned in place.? He will send me some promotional information. 

Some not-yet-updated information is available on the web at 
http://www.roartech.com/megafill/claiming that: 

?? Over 1000 lf. of pipe can be filled per day. 

??? The line will be filled with polyurethane foam to over 50% capacity 
??? (in most cases 100%). 

?? Meets PCB Mega Rule (TSCA). 

?? Eliminates your need to track retired underground natural gas lines. 

?? No need for the one call system to be used for retired gas lines. 

?? Eliminates the generation of potentially hazardous waste water 
?? created by the rinsing method of abandonment. 

?? No waiting for test results. 

?? No cost for analytical. 

?? GPS equipped trucks. 

He said they have now filled pipelines up to 42"" diameter.

its emissions guarantees, prior to shipping it to La Plata.  I was not aware

solve the problem, in November,  I had submitted a modification to the permit

unit exceeds its permitted levels during the colder months.  I received a 
call form the state of Colorado and they said they are hesitant to approve of 
more emissions for us.  We reached an agreement with the state that they 
would remove the pound per hour limit and keep the ton per year requirement 
in an attempt to give us more operating room (the higher emissions months

Subject: La Plata emissions issues

Rick, the A-102 unit at LaPlata is at a point, using calculated rolling 
averages, that it is exceeding the tons per year emissions level of NOX, CO, 
and VOC. If we continue to run at these points it could mean an NOV. The 
numbers that we used on the permit are the guranteed emission numbers from 
Solar Turbines (per Larry Campbell). We were wondering if you could approach 
Leon O'Brien and/or Ernie Roberts on what Solar could do to remedy this 
problem. We feel that a communication coming from you and Rich might carry a 
little more weight then the LaPlata Gang could muster. Larry Campbell 
suggested that we try to remedy this through Solar Turbines first, before we 
pursue other avenues. Let us know if we can help in any 
way.                       Tnanks, Terry

These are some points for discussion on the conference call next week.
In todays market, I think we all can agree that the profitability is there,
the only hurdle might be environmental or the potential for two phase flow.
If we could start with these points for discussion, and come to some
resolve on these issues, we can move to the logistics of the project.

   potential two phase flow. ( Ken Chow)
   Potential environmental concerns. (Emissions, Possible accumulation of

        ( Larry Campbell )

Sense this project will be taking advantage of peaks in the market, the
most logical answer is to make this equipment portable. If we plan on long
term benefits at the California border, this could be a permit installation
with a pipeline hookup from a new rail facility in Needles. But, other
areas might be identified like inlets to power plants that justify portable
equipment with NGL supplied by truck. Supplying the butane by truck from
rail facility's like the one in Mohave, might also be a way to get the
project in Needles on-line sooner. Just some topic's for discussion.

Rich,

I have an idea. It is a little far fetched, but could potentially make
excelr 100MM in the first year so hear me out.

At the regional meeting this month, I was interested in the discussions
about the gas delivery's to the California border, and how the pipeline was
running at capacity. When I heard the potential of dollars that could be
made If we only had more capacity, I was shocked. This will hopefully be a
way to increase your MMBTU delivery without major expense. Someone might
have already looked at this, but if not, it might be worth the time.

Although the pipeline is full of MCF's it has room if you look at BTU's. I
received an analysis of the gas delivered to the border and found it was
running at 1015 BTU, with less than %.5 C3+. With the SoCal limit of C3+ at
%3, there is room to inject %2.5 C3+ and raise that BTU value.

The Idea is to use rail cars to transport Normal Butane (or any other NGL
that proves cost affective) to the California border, vaporize the liquid,
and inject the vapor into the pipeline up-stream of the custody meter to
SoCal Gas.

I know there is rail access in the area, so this should not be an issue. We
off-load the product, and vaporize it using heaters, or the more efficient
way is to use waste heat from a turbine engine. We then compress the vapor
and introduce it into the pipeline. My estimates are we can off-load up to
52 rail cars per day, vaporize the butane and compress the 50 MCF/day of
gas to pipeline pressure. This will raise the C3+ number to approximately
%2.75 just under the SoCal spec. The 52 rail cars of Butane will introduce
another 160,000 MMBTU per day but only raise your volume by 50MMCF, hardly
noticeable when you are at 2.2BCF. This idea will work at any facility
along the pipeline system that is a large delivery.

The C3+ that has the largest impact is Normal Butane due to is relatively
low cost and high BTU value. I am not sure what the Butane market is in
other areas, but we are selling Normal currently for .65c. /gal, and this
is abnormally high for California. The value of Normal Butane used in the
spreadsheet is .65c, the contract price currently used at the NCL plant.

I assumed .05c per gallon for operating cost. This number is conservative
as our operating cost at the NCL plant is .035c - .04c per gallon with full
fractionation. This number includes fuel necessary for vaporizing the
Butane, employees, etc. This operating cost number will drop dramatically
if we are able to use waste heat from a turbine. Most of the cost is fuel
necessary to run the heater.

The price used for sales gas is what I am not sure about. The price of
$8.50 /MMBTU is the number I have heard will hold for at least the next
year at the Cal. border, and possibly go up. No one knows if this is
sustainable for any length of time, but it is what I assumed for this
spreadsheet. (Notice the profit if you enter the gas value currently traded
at the Cal. border)

Take a look at the spreadsheet and hopefully it will clarify where I came
up with these numbers. All the BTU and MCF numbers for Normal Butane came
from the GPA Standard 2145 and all other numbers are my best guess. If you
find this an interesting idea, please forward to the appropriate people. I
would love to discuss it further so let me know what you think.

Rick

Larry -  thanks for 1999 and 2000 Conway and Belvieu prices. Attached is
the rest of the story. Compares those historic prices with equivalent value
of liquids as gas based on historic gas (Calif Socal Border) prices.  As we
suspected, values are negative (i.e. less value as gas) up until recently
and then the numbers turn very positive. i.e. Needles blending project does
not work on historic liquids/gas prices but certainly works now. Therefore,
back to the question of what is price forecast or spreads we can lock into.
I have been given a contact on the excelr gas desk that maybe able to help.

Project update







Follow up items from Kevin Hyatt

Q: What are the Btu restrictions of gas being delivered to major California
pipelines?

A:  TW's tariff calls for minimum 970 Btu's per cubic foot.  There is no
maximum Btu value specified.  The other qualification calls for "" no
hydrocarbons in liquid form at the temperature and pressure at which the
gas is delivered into Transporter's pipeline system.""  TW's contract spec
with SoCal reads the same way.  I could find no contract spec for the PG&E
or Mojave contracts so the default is TW's tariff.

Q: Have any Calif. LDC's done any NGL peaking injection in the past?

A: I spoke with Mike O'Donnell, Director of Gas System Operations for PG&E.
He recalls PG&E having some peaking equipment using NGL's on their system
10 - 15 years ago but nothing recent.  They had a vaporizer (maybe several)
situated on the lines as they came into San Francisco.  He also recalled a
vaporizer on a line that served a large electric power plant.
Interestingly enough, a Canadian outfit had called him recently asking the
same questions.  Mike indicated they would be interested in talking more
about the idea as we get further along

That's all for now, let me know if you have questions.

Rick, I got to thinking about this again last night with regards to the
effects towards Emissions and/or unit performance (air fuel ratio's
etc....)   So, I visited with a couple of folks today and we will need to
cross some hurdles with regards to our customers.  The air fuel ratio will
change so dramitically from a 1000 btu to a 1200 btu (just to use numbers)
that a sudden transition from one range to the other has and will probably
initiate an overspeed or flameout situation on the customers units.
Emmission levels will increase as the btu increases and depending on
current permit levels this may or may not require additional permitting on
the customers end.  (I would think as long as we are in spec, the Emissions
issue would still be the customers issue to deal with)  To adjust fuel/air
ratio's with some pre-warning (prior to overspeed or flameout) we may need
to provide a signal from our gas chromatograph to the customers unit RTU or
discuss the necessity of getting the customer to install their own
chromatograph.

These aren't any big hills to overcome (at least I wouldn't think they are)
but, again, you may want to have some suggestions or answers to the
questions before they are posed.....

Moving on:  ""Never be afraid to try something new.  Remember that amatuers
built the ark.  Professionals built the titanic.""

spreadsheet is .65c, the contract price currently used at the NCL plant.

I assumed .05c per gallon for operating cost. This number is conservative
as our operating cost at the NCL plant is .035c - .04c per gallon with full
fractionation. This number includes fuel necessary for vaporizing the
Butane, employees, etc. This operating cost number will drop dramatically
if we are able to use waste heat from a turbine. Most of the cost is fuel
necessary to run the heater.

The price used for sales gas is what I am not sure about. The price of
$8.50 /MMBTU is the number I have heard will hold for at least the next
year at the Cal. border, and possibly go up. No one knows if this is
sustainable for any length of time, but it is what I assumed for this
spreadsheet. (Notice the profit if you enter the gas value currently traded
at the Cal. border)

Take a look at the spreadsheet and hopefully it will clarify where I came
up with these numbers. All the BTU and MCF numbers for Normal Butane came
from the GPA Standard 2145 and all other numbers are my best guess. If you
find this an interesting idea, please forward to the appropriate people. I
would love to discuss it further so let me know what you think.

44208,campbell-l/all_documents/258.,<4023240.1075851883758.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Kenny,
I received a note from Dave Schafer's office that they had received a note 
from you that they thought should have come to me instead of Dave.  They were 
correct.  Please take note, for future emails, that I am John Shafer and not 
Dave Schafer.

Now, related to the essence of your email message below.  I am still in the 
process of gather information related to the California Endangered Species 
Act Memorandum or Understanding and Take Authorization as agreed to by the 
Koch Oil Company and the California Department of Fish and Game on Jan. 2, 
1998 (related to which Ed Attanasio has stated that such MOU and permit was 
assigned to EOTT after the sale of the facilities to EOTT).   I am requesting 
from Mr. Attanasio copies of the January 10 Annual Report that supposedly 
have been filed by EOTT with the CDFG related to activities associated with 
this MOU.  I am also holding conversations with Randi McCormick and Ed 
Attanasio related to the status of the USFWS Federal Incidental Take Permit 
issued to Arco Western Energy in March, 1996 covering the same properties.  
Therefore, my comments are somewhat cursory at this point - but I'm getting 
up to speed pretty fast on this very important issue.  

We need to thoroughly understand what agreements are in place (both with the 
CDFG and the USFWS) before we do something within this protected preserve to 
one of these rare, threatened or endangered species that we will all live to 
regret.  Everything may be perfect and all agency personnel happy as a ""tree 
frog in the middle of a swamp in August,"" but I'm not convinced yet that we 
even know what these predecessors agreed to and why.

Some of the things I am aware of at this point:
The California MOU and Incidental Take Permit applies to the North Coles 
Levee Natural Gas Fractionator Plant, Rogas Railcar facility, 250 miles of 
existing pipeline, and 155 miles of proposed pipeline. (Caveat: Is this 
project part of the 155 miles that has already been presented to the CDFG by 
Koch or is this something outside that agreement?  Also, what about the US 
Fish and Wildlife Service concerns over these species?  Where is the 
agreement with the USFWS?  If there is not one done a full-blown 
Environmental Impact Study will have to be performed to get the Section 7 
consultation done under the Federal Endangered Specie Act!).

The North Coles Plant occupies 90 acres - right in the heart of the protected 
preserve.

California Endangered species involved by the MOU and permit: 10 animals, 1 
shrimp, 10 plants (all of these are also Federally Endangered).
California Protected species involved by the MOU and permit: 2 animals (these 
are not listed by the Feds).

""Take Authorizations"" are very restricted (another words, if you illegally 
""take, kill, harrass, damage their habitat, etc."" one of these plants or 
animals - you go to jail and do not collect $200 when you pass go"".

Notices of activities to the CDFG are very restrictive and must be precisely 
completed prior to any ground disturbance.  In certain instances, prior to 
any human intrusion into protected areas.

Orientation and training related to the species, permit, restrictions, etc. 
must be done with all employees prior to entering a construction area.

Biologist must be on hand for all activities.

All covers on oil drains, pipes, pits, etc. must be maintained as to prevent 
injury to wildlife.

Pre-activity survey work must be done before any off-road driving is done 
(except in case of emergency).

Mitigation:  Permanent loss of habitat 3 to 1
  Temporary loss of habitat 1.1 to 1
  Compensation provided on annual basis in advance of year's activities 
(Caveat: Has this been   done?)

All pipe will be inspected prior to moving it.  

If a trapped or an injured animal is discovered, the CDFG is to be notified 
immediately.

All trenches are to provide an escape route for animals (in steep wall trench 
areas).

Lizards - in areas where the Blunt-Nosed Leopard Lizard are found, all 
excavation is to be done by hand!  Daylight work only.

Revegetate with local stock.

Reports during and post construction must be timely as indicated in permit.

All other activities (regular maintenance during the year) are to be reported 
on a January 10 Report filed with the CDFG stating the effectiveness of the 
measures taken.

Koch was to establish a ""Pledged Savings Account"" or trust for the amount 
needed to stand behind the activities undertaken during the year - until such 
""Habitat Management Land"" would be donated by Koch to mitigate for the 
impacts that had occurred.  Also, Koch was to provide an ""Endowment"" to CDFG 
for management of any new lands donated and pay all reasonable expenses.  (I 
assume this also applies to EOTT now that EOTT is the owner).

Koch could proceed (under this State Permit) with ground disturbance 
activities, prior to having the acreage to donate, as long as the savings 
account and/or trust was set up and funded to cover the activities.

Any default and the permit is rescinded and the CDFG will bring all charges 
(both corporate and individual).

Term - 25 years from Jan. 2, 1998.

(Caveat: A ""Scott Clark"" signed this agreement on behalf of Koch in 1998.  Is 
this the same Scott Clark that now works for Randy Rice?  


As you can see, I only know enough about this issue at this point to be 
dangerous.  However, I would caution each and every one of you to proceed 
with appropriate caution until we have all of the facts.  If we have a 
problem with the proposed construction or with our daily maintenance 
activities related to any of these species or this agreement, we will need to 
have all the facts correctly identified and completed.

I am also attempting to have a conference call with most of you to discuss 
this very important issue.  

Thanks, John Shafer

__________________

The California Fish and Game must give there approval of the project before 
we can start construction. It is my understanding that they have the project 
on there desk and are looking at it. Once we receive there approval we will 
send a biologist out to trap for three days to see what species are in the 
path of construction. At the same time we can put up the bond for purchase of 
the required compensation lands with the Kern Water Bank Authority and Area 
Energy. The 1081 permit we have with the Fish and Game requires a 14 day 
notices before start of construction with a company contact. Under Ed 
Attanasio guidance I sent notice of construction to the Fish and Game and 
that I would be the local contact for this project. One issue that could keep 
us from trapping is the outside temperature, if it is to cold the species 
will be trapped and not able to get back to there burrows and will freeze to 
death. Randi McCormick believes we will have approval in two weeks but there 
is not any guarantee, the State works at there own pace.

The second issues is a stream bed alteration permit with the Army Corp of 
Engineers for crossing the Kern River By-Pass channel. Gary Fuller had put 
West Coast Environmental in charge of getting this permit. I talked with them 
Friday and they had not turned in the application yet. Typically these 
permits take 30 to 45 days for approval, they assured me they would get the 
application submitted. We could use someone in environmental to get involved 
with this.

Thanks for the info.

I wanted to give you an update on the CoGen project.  I have met with
several groups in ENA Development, and the potential for a fuel switching
facility is attracting a lot of attention.  They initially considered the
20 MW portable unit, but now think there may be more value with a 40 to 50
MW unit.  The opportunity to generate more power using the fuel advantage
caught their eye.  The current scheme is to site the facility at the Tupman
plant, provide EOTT steam and power at a reduced cost, ENA market the
electricity, and EOT participate in the revenue of power sale.  This has
the advantage of controlled energy cost for the plant, participation in the
revenue stream, and limited capital outlay for EOTT.  The downside would be
lack of control of the merchant power activity, and it would be a permanent
facility.  I am also assuming permitting and emissions compliance issues
would not be extraordinary.

There will be a longer construction time, but I stressed to ENA that a new
boiler would need to be built first in anticipation of the generator, and
then it could be incorporated when available.

There were some more questions regarding the plant's energy profile.  I
gave them the information showing historic, and anticipated energy needs,
both for power and gas.  They do need to understand what the daily heat
requirements would be; i.e.  hours of operation at the plant, 8 hr
operations Vs 24 hr operation, temperature requirements for your processes,
are there peak requirements, are there any pressure requirements for steam
or just heat, does the plant shut down operations routinely, etc.  I passed
along you names (Rick & Scott only) as plant contacts as questions come up.

Thanks for your help, and I'll let you know how things progress.

I spoke with Tony Estrada yesterday concerning the sampling protocol and he 
indicated that the document is almost finished.  We then focused our 
discussion upon agenda items for the upcoming meeting in Las Vegas on 
Monday.  One thing we should begin to think about and I'm pretty sure it will 
be an agenda topic during the meeting, is the issue of the pipe contamination 
between our Measuring station and their compresssor station.  Tony's feeling 
is that  with all the cleaning of equipment and installation of the pigging 
facilities, this section of pipe may be a future headache.

It seems that Vector was onsite with the PG&E and they may have pointed out 
this point of concern.  PG&E might possibly want this this portion of the 
system flushed.

2) Permits for Hwy 43 and Interstate 5 are state Permits through Caltrans,
at this time we have not received the permits. Helt Engineering has
repeatedly made calls but are having difficulty getting anyone to answer
the phone. I have asked them to notify Caltrans of who is the contractor
for the project. Alan if you can provide me with the name of the boring

have an answer soon I will make a trip to Fresno and see what I can find
out. Matt, Floyd Little is the contact for Caltrans, you probably remember
the problems you had when you tried to contact him.

3) Gary Fuller put West Coast Environmental in charge of obtaining a permit
for crossing the Kern River By-Pass channel from the Army Corp of

been filed. Larry Campell with the environmental department has been asked
to contact West Coast Environmental for the status of the permit

Matt,

In order for Ken Small Construction to plan and schedule the work in the
most economic manner we would like the following information in hand prior
to starting field construction work.

1) Copy of permit from Kern County Water Agency for the Cross Valley Canal
with the drawing that was submitted for permit application.

2) Copy of permit from Kern County for the Enos Lane crossing with drawing
that was submitted for permit application, also I need to get KSCI listed
as
contractor on permit.

3) Copy of permit from Caltrans for the I-5 crossing with drawing that was
submitted for permit application, also I need to get KSCI listed as rider
along with bore contractor.

4) Copy of permit from Army Corps of Engineers for the Kern River crossing
with drawing that was submitted for permit application, along with any
conditions required.

5) Copy of Fish & Game, Kern Water Bank Authority, Buena Vista Water
Storage
and West Kern Water requirements or conditions for construction of the
pipelines.

Your help in letting KSCI know the status of the above permits as soon as
possible will also help to set up a workable schedule that we can utilize
for our construction purposes.

Thanks for the update.

I can indeed confirm that we have the 2081 in place.  (But, to be precise, it 
was not ARCO Energy's 2081; it was a 2081 that was issued in the first 
instance to Koch that was assigned to us.  So, make sure the 2081 you are 
working off of is the Memorandum of Understanding between fish and game and 
Koch, and not a permit issued to Arco.)

Also, according to Kenny M, West Coast Environ is working on some other 
permit for the 6-inch line (I don't recall exactly what it is, but Kenny can 
tell you.  Unfortunately, the handoff from Gary to you folks seems to have 
left us in a bit of disarray, so it'll all have to be tracked down this 
way.)  Pehaps you can crack the whip on West Coast re this also?  Thanks.

R equirements

With respect to the environmental clearances and permits for the Rogas 
project, here is where we presently stand.

2081 State Fish and Game Permit.  According to the North Coles facility, Ed 
Attanasio has a letter from Koch authorizing transfer of the ARCO Energy 2081 
permit to EOTT.

10A1B Federal US Fish and Wildlife Permit for EOTT.  I have checked on the 
status of this permit  which will be issued to EOTT by  the USFWS and am in 
the process of trying to push it along.  The wheels of govt. sometime move 
pretty slow.  We are waiting for written approval from USFWS to the Kern 
Water Bank approving of EOTT using the KWB 10A1B permit  use for the Rogas 
project only.  this letter is expected by the end of next week.   I will keep 
everyone updated.   

The biologist is ready and waiting for a start date to begin her surveys and 
has stated that the cold temperatures may cause her to delay her sampling and 
survey work as mandated by the Department of Fish and Game.  

The issue of the water by pass channel crossing is still in progress.  We 
will need approval under 404 Nationwide Permit, 1603 streambed alteration 
notification approval and State Reg Board Authorization.  I have contacted 
the consultant Gary has been using for assistance with these applications and 
they are sending  applications to my attention.  The signed and completed 
packets  will be going out fed-x tomorrow.  I would expect a 30 day waiting 
period before these documents are signed by the agencies, however, because 
these approvals apply only to the by pass channel feature, this should not 
delay initial construction of the project .

I have prepared the stormwater permit application for construction activities 
which are required for construction activities greater than 5 acres.

1) We have the permit and drawing for boring the Kern County Water Agencies
Cross Valley Canal. I will also contact Helt Engineering for the canal
profile and Soils Engineering for the soil analysis.

2) Permits for Hwy 43 and Interstate 5 are state Permits through Caltrans,
at this time we have not received the permits. Helt Engineering has
repeatedly made calls but are having difficulty getting anyone to answer
the phone. I have asked them to notify Caltrans of who is the contractor
for the project. Alan if you can provide me with the name of the boring
contractor I will provide that information at the same time. If I do not
have an answer soon I will make a trip to Fresno and see what I can find
out. Matt, Floyd Little is the contact for Caltrans, you probably remember
the problems you had when you tried to contact him.

3) Gary Fuller put West Coast Environmental in charge of obtaining a permit
for crossing the Kern River By-Pass channel from the Army Corp of
Engineers. As we discussed last week the application for the permit had not
been filed. Larry Campell with the environmental department has been asked
to contact West Coast Environmental for the status of the permit
application. I will provide the drawing, permit and permit requirements
when we receive them.

4) I will gather copies of the conditions and requirements from the water
districts and provide that to Alan.

5) We have not received the Fish and Games approval at this time. When we
receive it and have final approval from our environmental and legal
departments I will provide the Permit to Alan.

As you know we are at the States mercy on obtaining these permits. We are
shooting for the two week starting date as mention earlier. I will keep you
informed.

Matt,

In order for Ken Small Construction to plan and schedule the work in the
most economic manner we would like the following information in hand prior
to starting field construction work.

1) Copy of permit from Kern County Water Agency for the Cross Valley Canal
with the drawing that was submitted for permit application.

2) Copy of permit from Kern County for the Enos Lane crossing with drawing
that was submitted for permit application, also I need to get KSCI listed
as
contractor on permit.

3) Copy of permit from Caltrans for the I-5 crossing with drawing that was
submitted for permit application, also I need to get KSCI listed as rider
along with bore contractor.

4) Copy of permit from Army Corps of Engineers for the Kern River crossing
with drawing that was submitted for permit application, along with any
conditions required.

5) Copy of Fish & Game, Kern Water Bank Authority, Buena Vista Water
Storage
and West Kern Water requirements or conditions for construction of the
pipelines.

Your help in letting KSCI know the status of the above permits as soon as
possible will also help to set up a workable schedule that we can utilize
for our construction purposes.

44217,campbell-l/all_documents/266.,<4626971.1075851883948.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I am writing you to inform you of an incident that occurred at the NCL
FRACTIONATOR this week. I would like to go into detail on what occurred to
ensure that everyone has a good understanding of what kind of employee is
involved and the potential for further intentional acts like this from this
disgruntled employee. I would like to have some feedback on this to ensure
that we take the necessary means to ensure that we cover all of the basis.

On Wednesday 1/31/01 we had a PSV go off on one of our process vessels due
to a plant upset. I was notified that the incident was minimal with no
spill or Hydrocarbon release which exceeded the reportable quantity. I
quickly drove to the sight and investigated the incident, I found the
information to be true. There was no detectable hydrocarbon, only a small
amount of rust on the ground which was ejected from the inside of the
emergency stack. I notified the head plant operator & requested an incident
report to be filled out, which he has since delivered to me. I checked the
stack chart and noticed only a small release. At this point I felt that
there was no reason to call in a breakdown to the APCD because we had
neither exceeded the reportable quantity, and the equipment did as it was
designed breaking no rules. I then assigned a clean up crew and an employee
to inspect the PSV's and ensure the proper operation of the equipment
involved. All was cleaned up and the equipment serviced properly, and I am
currently going over the incident report with our safety coordinator.

During the clean up on the day of the incident I was approached by our
Utility Operator Clark Layshot who was on during the incident. Clark was
very upset and was pointing the finger at Mark Stringer who was the Head
Operator on duty. Clark said that the PSV had gone off for an hour and had
released over 5000 gallons of NGL. I new this to be untrue for many
reasons, for one I responded quickly enough that the liquid would still
have been there on the ground, the chart showed exactly the time of
starting and stopping of the release which was just a matter of minutes, I
also new because I was on the phone with the others involved on my drive
out to the plant. I listened to Clarks remarks and let him know that I was
investigating the incident and the discussion was ended.

The following day while I was giving a operational tour to Eugene Ogorman,
I was confronted once more by Clark who said he needed to speak to me
immediately, so I excused myself and met with Clark. Clark said that I
could either have 5 hours or 2 weeks, I asked Clark what he meant and he
said that he was giving his notice. I then asked him why when he became
extremely hostile and said in many words that he was very unhappy! He told
me that everyone was liars, that excelr was a horrible company, that the
facility was going to blow up and how he was going to kick some of the
employees asses. This went on for a while with numerous other extremely
intense encounters. I then notified my boss, Rick Suderman who in turn made
the appropriate calls.

Today we were the recipients of an incident investigation performed by the
SJVU APCD. We were met by Mike Oldershaw of the APCD who typically does our
compliance testing. Mike informed us that his office was notified of an
incident which released for 48 hours NGL through our west emergency stack.
They were also told that the ground was saturated with hydrocarbon and
insinuated that EOTT/ETS operations was trying to hide this.

Myself and Rick Suderman accompanied Mike through the complete
investigation which included inspection of the release sight, inspection of
the operator logs, inspection of the stack flow charts, and an emission
inspection of the components involved. Mike expressed to us that who ever
called in was disgruntled and obviously fabricated a story to try and
create problems for the company. We went over the permit for the usage of
the emergency stack and all agreed that we were not in violation. Mike was
not sure if a breakdown needed to be reported, so he agreed to call us with
the final outcome of this investigation once he discussed it with his boss.

I am happy to say that after all of this Mike Oldershaw called me back and
said that he had talked to his boss and they both agree that we followed
the rules and none were broken. Mike said that we were in compliance and
there would be no NOTICE OF VIOLATION, the equipment did as it was designed
and the operations group worked well in controlling and isolating the
situation. Mike said that he feels very good about what EOTT and ETS is
doing and the approach that we are taking to ensure compliance. I have
since notified Larry Campbell who informed me to call John steenberg and to
send an email to all of you.

I have the State Rec Board and Kern County encroachment permit application
materials together. I also have the ACOE - 404 and RWQCB 401 information
ready for your review. You should receive all the packages tomorrow by
Fed-Ex.

I will e-mail the cover letters for you to modify as necessary and put on
your letterhead. I haven't formatted any headers or footers, as I assumed
you would have your own format style.

I need your input on a couple of questions/comments in order to finalize
things.

1) I have been listing the applicant as EOTT Energy Operating Limited
Partnership. Should I continue to list EOTT as the applicant, or should we
use excelr Transportation Services? I understand that the pipeline operator
will be excelr Pipeline Services Co.

2) Who should the local contact be? I've been using Kenny Maltby primarily
because Gary Fuller is gone, and Kenny knew what was happening from a
construction scheduling standpoint. Kenny now says that Scott Jones at the
North Coles Levee Gas Plant might possibly be the local contact. Or should
we use your name and office, as you may want to take the lead on dealing
with these agencies? Also, some of these applications/documents allow for an
agent (such as myself), but we may have to have signed authorizations in
order to do so.

3) It is my understanding that part of the overall Rogas project involves
the abandonment of an existing pipeline which travels in a separate location
through Kern Water Agency's groundwater recharge area. We may want to
address this in our application materials and get approvals as part of this
project, even though the active line may not be abandoned until a later
date. This line crosses the same bypass channel, and Kenny informed me that
they have an agreement with West Kern Water that they will remove all
abandoned lines unless they are in an ""environmentally sensitive"" area. This
allows you the option of capping the line on either side of the bypass
channel and leaving it in place. We would probably need the water district's
approval on this. If so, then we don't need to approach the ACOE, DFG,
RWQCB, State Reclamation Board, etc. Just something to consider. If we do
need to pull the abandoned line, we would have to go back to all these
agencies and get approvals again, pay fees, etc.

Subject: Re: TW Expansion emissions  

Arnold, I feel the major permitting issue will be if we add NOx or CO 
emissions greater than PSD levels (40 tons per year) at the facility.  
However, if we were to remove one or more of the existing recip units at each 
compressor station or reduce operating hours on one or more recip units to 
allow the emissions from the turbine to be included with the facility, this 
should be more than enough of a facility reduction that the turbine emissions 
would pose no problem.  To add the turbine emissions without taking away 
existing emissions from the facility will more that likely kick us into PSD.  
This is a very time consuming and extremely expensive option and would more 
than likely cause us to do extensive modeling and retrofit emissions control 
technology on any emissions source which is at the facility.  Because we 
operate both 2 cycle lean burn and 4 cycle rich burns on the system, our 
emissions control technology options can be limited and could increase 
additional manpower in the operation of the control technologies.  

I would also like to bring up a potential problem that probably has not be 
addressed and that is the issue of emissions impacting the Grand Canyon.  I 
have been contacted by the state of Arizona several years  ago concerning 
questions about modeling  our emissions and  the problems the state is 
encountering with emissiosn sources impacting a Class 1 sentive area.  The 
Grand Canyon is in this classification.  I dont know how or to what extent 
our present emissions might impact the Canyon, however, due to the relative 
proximity and prevailing wind directions toward the Canyon from a couple of 
our stations, I wouldnt be surprised if airshed concerns become an issue.   
As a planning tool, I would allow 4-6 months for non PSD permitting and 12-18 
months for permitting PSD facilities.  Again understand that these time 
estimates might be too conservative.  Another issue is that we will be 
dealing with two different air agencies.  The State of Arizona and the Navajo 
Nation EPA.  As is the present case, all major permitting for facilities on 
the Navajo Resevation has in the past gone through Region IX EPA with 
descretion from the NNEPA..  As you may or may not know, stations 3 and 4 are 
on the Reservation.

I have left a call with Bill Kendrick to determine if I should initiate data 
gathering for the permit application submittal or if someone else is to do 
the permitting.  When I hear from him, Ill let you know what he says. In any 
event you are right, we should probably discuss this further.....

We have only provided data at 100 % base load because this produces the

Earl Arnold, I have heard through the grapevine that Stan has approved the 
abondonment of the existing recips and installation of a turbine to replace

greatly appreciate the engine manufacturers emissions  and performance data

noise data for the the environmental F-1 report to be submitted to the FERC.

I had also heard that the plan was to submit the FERC application by March

Your help in a  turbine manufacturer contact would be very helpful.

I spoke with Clarence Mayott in the DFG Fresno office.  He said based on his
knowledge of the area and the information provided that our project should
not require 1603 permitting.  He did want to see the notification package
and anticipates providing a letter stating that the project is outside the
scope of Section 1600 of the Fish & Game code.  He also commented on CEQA
(Calif. Env. Quality Act) requirements, particularly the wildlife and
habitat issues.  He thinks that with the CESA 2081 permit and a letter from
Kern County regarding the ministerial nature of this project, we might be
able claim that CEQA has been addressed.  This will be ultimately decided by
either the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) or State Rec Board
as these are state agencies which may be issuing discretionary permits.  If
either of these agencies requires CEQA analysis, they may rely on the
County's letter and the 2081 permit, or they would have to do their own CEQA
analysis.  I'm working on getting a letter from the Kern County Planning
Dept.  Do you have a copy of the 2081 documents?  This is one document I

consider inserting
  this into the cover letter just to drive the point home that
we have
  CESA/FESA coverage under existing agreements.

  No. 2081-1997-97-4) with the California Dept. of Fish and
Game pursuant to
  incidental take of species listed under the California
Endangered Species
  Act (CSA) Section 2081.  This M.O.U. applies to operations
(including
  pipeline activities) related to the North Coles Levee

  the Rogas rail facility.  EOTT has also reached agreement
with Kern Water
  Bank Authority (KWBA) to use their Section 10 (a) (1) (b)
permit for
  incidental take of species listed under the Federal
Endangered Species Act
  (FESA).

  Also, I spoke with Ed Purcell of Helt Engineering regarding

The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above

I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their 
C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs 
to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision 
is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done 
during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also 
need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology 
to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes

Subject: Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

If the CO emissions cause a problem, I can investigate with our engineering

condition in a right of way granted by the BLM in 1997.  Specifically, Koch 
failed to procure 29 acres of habitat compensation acreage.  It is now our

obtain this acreage.  Per the right of way, Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve

which you can send to me if you are able to strike a deal for the acreage.)  
Randi McCormick can provide additional technical assistance with this if you 
need it.  

 Of course, we also need to acquire acreage for the Rogas project, but I'd

The find of PCBs in the compressors will undoubtedly be the subject of next 
week's meeting.  The presence of PCBs does not limit their use at that 
station.  PG&E would be reluctant to move the engines around on the system.  
Depending upon the concentrations at the time, they may be restricted in 
their ability to sell or reuse the compressors.  I'm not aware of any true 
decon process for such equipment.  Vector may be able to propose a piecemeal 
decon project but it would likely be expensive and involve the outage of the 
equipment for a significant period of time.   We might want to gather a group 
of folks and go over the agenda and our pososible response to a request by 
PG&E to take down thier compression.

Subject: Additonal Information Concerning PG&E

On a related note, I spoke to Vector concerning the equipment which was 
suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system.  It is as follows:

 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 
2-10.84 drip locations

The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above 
PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000.  

I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their 
C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs 
to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision 
is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done 
during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also 
need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology 
to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes 
to 36"".  

One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas 
compressors.  In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were 
found at regulated levels.....

44246,campbell-l/all_documents/292.,<18978081.1075851884559.JavaMail.evans@thyme>," Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated 
February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our 
project ""for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank,"" and 
authorizing the Water Bank ""to extend their incidental take authority to you 
and your entire project under their Master Permit.""  This is, of course, very 
good news.

 The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation 
acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.  Specifically, 
we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern Water Bank to 
acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get included in their 
Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from the Coles Levee 
Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have purchased 15.3 
acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set aside that amount 
from credits we have in the past purchased.

 While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise 
because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that whenever 
a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically get their 
lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only slows things 
down -- or worse.

 My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact Cheryl 
as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for acquisition of 
23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to include EOTT (and 
its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also be informed that, 
while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL credits, we will by the 
end of this week have a letter of credit posted as security, as allowed under 
our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of acreage.  Ask whether a copy 
of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or whether we will need to have the 
actual acreage purchased.

 As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new lines, it 
is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed.  Please call me 
if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to discuss how to 
approach this issue.  Thanks a lot.

     Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated
February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our
project ""for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank,"" and
authorizing the Water Bank ""to extend their incidental take authority to
you and your entire project under their Master Permit.""  This is, of
course, very good news.

     The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation
acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.
Specifically, we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern
Water Bank to acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get
included in their Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from
the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have
purchased 15.3 acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set
aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased.

     While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise
because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that
whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically
get their lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only
slows things down -- or worse.

     My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact
Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for
acquisition of 23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to
include EOTT (and its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also
be informed that, while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL
credits, we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as
security, as allowed under our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of
acreage.  Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or
whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased.

     As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new
lines, it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed.
Please call me if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to
discuss how to approach this issue.  Thanks a lot.

I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the
purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) in there approval letter.  This in indeed ""good news"" and EOTT
must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental
Take Permit.  By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work
with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation
as promptly as possible.

It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do,
that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North
Coles Levee Preserve.  You should verify the exact credit number and
furnish the Service with such verification.  That is acreage EOTT will not
have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit.

Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.  John Shafer

by Hoover and Keith out of Houston, Tx.  I have a meeting scheduled with the 
permit engineers from state of Arizona on Monday to discuss the permitting 
for the two C/S on state lands.  Ive dealt with these individuals before, but 
the ADEQ has gone through some reg changes and I want to visit with them on 
that.  After that meeting, I will decide who should do the applications.  I 
have  calls in to the person I deal with in the EPA in San Francisco for the 
two locations on the Navajo lands.  Pending the outcome of each  meeting, I 
will decide who to use.  Ive used Argent in the past for both Arizona permits 
and Indian lands permits, and they would probably be my first choice.    

I am keeping Mr. Ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or 
activities that impact the permits for Arizona.  One thing that I shold 
mention is that I spoke with Phil Lowery about his desires for this project.  
He has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations 
for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in 
the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential 
kinks.  Based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline 
units, which will be permitted for a six month period, there will still be an 
overall  major emissions decrease.  After the six month period, the existing 
units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again.    Also, my 
intent is to permit these turbines at 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the lower 25 
ppm NOx number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on 
the Northern Border system.  If this was a new station, I probably wouldnt be 
allowed to use the 45 number, but seeing as how there will be a major 
decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine, 
this should be easy to do.  The differrence in emission between 45 and 25 is 
not that great and it will allow the facilities in Az a larger range of 
operation comfort as opposed to the 25 ppm number that Rolls says they can 
do, but has had trouble reaching.  One thing that has complicated the 
permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations.  By 
permitting at 45 ppm, this will greatly help this.     Ill share the 
emissions numbers with you, when I receive them from Rolls and the emissions 
info I have from the existing units. 

I have spoken to Terry Hacket about doing the F-1 document for the FERC 
submittal, and have been feeding him data and supporting information for the 
report.  Based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation, the F-1 
report will be completed by March 1.    

Is there something Ive missed?

Approval has been given to proceed with preliminary activities to accomplish 
an expansion on the TW System on a ""Fast Track"".  The option which has been 
approved is Option #1 (38,000 hp turbine at Stations 1, 2 3 and 4.)  At this 
time you should prepare a Work Order authorization for $350,000 to capture 
those preliminary cost.  I assume that negotiations with a compressor 
manufacturer will result  in a requirement to commit to an order within the 
next 60 days.  Before a final order (with a cancellation schedule) can be 
executed we will need additional approval authorization.  When you have 
determined the Project Manager for this project please inform all the 
interested individuals.  We look forward to reviewing a project timeline in 
the very near future.

John, Lou, Cutty, Bill, I want to bring this issue back up for your 
attention, as I know that everyone is very busy.  During the EPA Title V 
inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna 
environmental person was present.  She had been asked to be there by the 
EPA.  During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or 
decision had been made by excelr management towards remediation assistance in 
the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.  I had informed her that we were 
still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future 
concerning management's decision.  I would appreciate it very much if each of 
you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done 
and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a 
proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure.

Subject: Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

First date: You get to kiss her good night.
Second date: You get to grope all over and make out.
Third date: You get to have sex in the missionary position. Then you promise 
to marry her but will probably abandon the idea.

Indian women:
First date: You meet the girl.
Second date: You set the wedding date.
Thrid date: The wedding night.



Chinese women:

First date: You get to buy her an expensive dinner but nothing happens.
Second date: You buy her an even more expensive dinner but nothing happens 
too.
Third date: You don't even get to the third date and you have already 
realized nothing is going to happen.

Vietnamese girls:
First date: What first date? ... no such thing
Second date: You get married to some girl you've never seen before from 
overseas.
Third date: You divorce, get paid $10,000 from her family (minus a percentage 
from the guy that set you up).but only after you've helped them all immigrate 
to Canada or US take your pick.

Filipino girls:
First date: It took you forever to get a date with this really hot chick of 
your dreams (that has a killer bod), but she won't let you even kiss her.
Second date: She takes you to church and everyone thinks you're really cute 
and such a nice guy; but you still haven't even kissed her because she's a 
""proper girl"".
Third date: You kiss for the first time, but miraculously she ends up 
pregnant and you have to marry her or her cousins, brothers, uncles, etc., 
will cut your penis off, and you keep wondering what happened!? Even more 
miraculous: the kid IS yours!

Korean girls:
First date: She only went out with you cause she hates the steroid-pumped, 
chauvinistic Korean guys that
are always after her.

Second date: She flirts with all your friends, but ignores you.

Third date: She's dumped you and is going out with a black guy that is 3 
times your size (in every way). She doesn't even ""remember"" who you are, 
neither do her friends so you have no chance of ever going out again with a 
Korean chick cause they all talk and you were an asshole anyway.

Japanese women:
First date: She's shy, so you don't get to kiss her at all.
Second date: She'll take a bath in front of you and let you smell her panties.
Third date: You get to have kinky sex with her. Then she will bid you 
sayonara as that was her fling before getting married to a Japanese man.



Thai girls:
First date: You flirted with her while she was giving you a really bad lap 
dance.
Second date: You go play pool, see a movie, or meet at a club and she tells 
you how she is making so little money here, but better than her computer 
programming job back in Thailand. You're not really paying attention though 
because this is the first time you've seen her in the light and without 
make-up, the smoky haze, and the influence of alcohol.she is BUTT ugly!
Third date: She smiles and says hi as she passes you while she's on her way 
over to the table with all the
Chinese/Vietnamese gangsters.  She'll spend the rest of the night 
lap-dancing/smoking/talking with them.
You're afraid to look over cause you think you'll get shot or jumped in the 
parking lot. You vow to never go
there again, at least till your friend tells you about ""this really hot chick 
he saw there.""



And finally ...

ABC (American Born Chinese) girls:
First date: She met you in a group of people and you were the only Asian guy 
in the group. In fact you two are the only Asians in the group cause you're 
both bananas. People think you two should go out cause you're both 
Chinese.""   Second date: You go to dim sum, but neither of you can order 
because neither of you speak Chinese. The waiters give you really bad 
service, and you don't get any specials.
Third date: It doesn't work out, cause you're not Asian enough and she goes 
back out with some white guy she dated 5 years ago.  Eventually they get 
married and the Asian population diminishes! Or she decides she's a lesbian 
and goes out with some really Bohemian white chick that's into alternative 
music. and ends up fighting for some social cause for the rest of her life.



You marry an Asian girl and wonder what ever happened to your 
life...Or...money!!

upcoming meeting.   The call was cordial.  A couple of items that came up 
worth passing on are as follows:

 There is some expectation in PG&E to decon the compressors.  They may not 
wish to do so right now but maybe soon.  There is also discussion of these 
being out of service for up to a couple of months.  I passed along the idea 
that it is probably best to simply monitor the situation and the PCB matters 
may well take care of themselves through routine maintenance activities and 
continued operation.  No official decon processes exist as far as were are 
aware.  There are no restrictions on their continued use exist at that 
location.  PG&E may be considering employee exposure or continued source of 
contamination as issues why they want to decon. We should expect to this to 
come up during the meeting.  I do not think that this type of decon would 
necessarily be in line with the standard for reimbursement under our 
operating agreement - which is ""reasonable action, measured in accordance 
with commonly accepted standards of care and practice in the natural gas 
pipeline industry in California.""  I'm not aware of SoCal engaging in any 
such action even though their system was highly impacted by PCBs.   I did not 
bring this standard up but we should be aware of it and recommend monitoring 
before any decisions are made.  My counterpart did acknowledge that even when 
the Long Term facilities eliminated the delivery problem, that we may well 
have continued issues with respect to the PCBs in the station and the 15 
miles of pipe downstream for some lengthy period of time.  PG&E did not 
appear to be contemplating any pigging or decon of this section of the system.

 PG&E may be looking for some more comfort on the question of ""source 
control"".  We have said that this situation is relatively unique to the 
Topock Lateral but we have had some minor hits elsewhere recently.  We should 
be in a position to explain why the remainder of the system is not a problem 
and even if it should be why the Long term facilities should be able to 
handle any concerns.

Fish and Game on November 3, 2000. In the letter the Fish and Game agreed
EOTT has 41 Acres of conservation credits based on Arco Western Energy's
sale of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant and premises to Koch Oil
and Gas, and Koch's subsequent sale of the plant and premises to EOTT
ENERGY.

In the letter the following limitations and clarifications were listed:

Because the conservation credits may be used for mitigation of EOTT
impacts, or sold by EOTT to third parties for their own mitigation needs,
EOTT must affirm that it will conform to the Department's  standards for
sale of conservation credits as well as management of the credit lands.

These obligations are already implied by the chain of Koch's and then
EOTT's acquisitions  of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant. EOTT and
Department representatives will need to meet to discuss these details and
determine the most efficient means to implement these conditions.

Key provision of the obligations that attend using the conservation credits
include Department approval of third-party sales;  minimum endowment
requirements for all credit sales; management and monitoring of habitat
conditions; and additional mitigation for disturbance to dedicated habitat.

Habitat continuity and small animal movement between the North Coles
fractionator plant site and the remainder of Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve
must be provided in order to maintain viability of the habitat within
EOTT's holdings.

 Although it appears we do have the credits for NCL, I do not know if Gary
ever met with the Fish and Game to discuss the details or means to
implement the conditions for use of the conservation credits. With the
project set to start we may have to purchase the 15.3 acres of credit from

Kenny and Scott,

I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the
purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) in there approval letter.  This in indeed ""good news"" and EOTT
must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental
Take Permit.  By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work
with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation
as promptly as possible.

It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do,
that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North
Coles Levee Preserve.  You should verify the exact credit number and
furnish the Service with such verification.  That is acreage EOTT will not
have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit.

Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.  John Shafer

Subject:  Rogas Line -- USFW Approval


     Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated
February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our
project ""for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank,"" and
authorizing the Water Bank ""to extend their incidental take authority to
you and your entire project under their Master Permit.""  This is, of
course, very good news.

     The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation
acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.
Specifically, we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern
Water Bank to acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get
included in their Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from
the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have
purchased 15.3 acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set
aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased.

     While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise
because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that
whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically
get their lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only
slows things down -- or worse.

     My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact
Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for
acquisition of 23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to
include EOTT (and its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also
be informed that, while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL
credits, we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as
security, as allowed under our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of
acreage.  Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or
whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased.

     As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new
lines, it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed.
Please call me if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to
discuss how to approach this issue.  Thanks a lot.

                          --ETA

SoCal concerning presence of PCBs on the Southwest Gas system will be this 
tuesday.  I had an opportunity to speak with Ralph Komai today during the PCB 
quarterly management conference call  that Transwestern has with SoCal to 
discuss PCB related invoices.  As a brief summary, Southwest has had isolated 
hits of PCB in liquids (232 and 132 ppm) and in wipe tests (10-100 ug/wipe)  
in regulators on their system and they have asked Ralph if he would assist 
them in the management and disposal of PCBs on their system.  He wil also be 
providing thoughts on how and why PCBs move in a gas pipeline.

I had asked Ralph not to mention about Transwestern's agreement with SoCal 
for which Transwestern pays SoCal for 86% of their PCB costs.  I had asked 
him to only focus on the Southwest system.  Apparently Southwest is not up to 
speed with the PCB regualtions, however, enough so that they do realize that 
the mega rule will impact their operations and Ralph will probably provide 
input for that as well from an LDC standpoint.

discovery on their system and he indicated that they were more concerned

contact with them is through our consultant. To get this project started we
might  have to purchase the compensation credits through Area or face more
delays. The approval from the Fish and Wildlife Service stated that the
Kern Water Bank would need a letter from CLEP that we had purchased
compensation credits. I contacted them today to see if we could post a
letter of credit instead but they had not received the approval letter from

out.  Do you feel comfortable going to them or would you like me to go with
you?  I think under the circumstances, we both should meet with the Game
and Fish and make sure that they have a level of confidence in EOTT and
this project.  Due to  Randi's involvement, why dont you get a contact from
her and lets discuss an appropriate time next week (Tuesday or Wednesday)
to meet the F&G?  There are some other issues we need to discuss with them
in addition to this conservation credit acreage and we can make the most
out  of the trip.

Subject:  Rogas Line -- USFW Approval


     Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated
February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our
project ""for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank,"" and
authorizing the Water Bank ""to extend their incidental take authority to
you and your entire project under their Master Permit.""  This is, of
course, very good news.

     The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation
acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.
Specifically, we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern
Water Bank to acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get
included in their Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from
the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have
purchased 15.3 acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set
aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased.

     While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise
because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that
whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically
get their lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only
slows things down -- or worse.

     My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact
Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for
acquisition of 23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to
include EOTT (and its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also
be informed that, while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL
credits, we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as
security, as allowed under our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of
acreage.  Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or
whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased.

     As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new
lines, it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed.
Please call me if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to
discuss how to approach this issue.  Thanks a lot.

Drafts of the 1999 and 2000 annual reports for your CESA MOU are attached 
for  
your use (Wordperfect). There are two outstanding issues regarding the 1999  
report. After speaking with Ed Attanasio, it appears that the Letter of  
Credit issued in 1999 may have expired in 2000 without habitat being  
purchased. This letter of credit either needs to be reestablished or habitat  
needs to be purchased to offset these disturbances. In addition, I do not  
have a copy of evidence that the Coles Levee credits were purchased (for the  
one Coles Levee project in 1999). 

Regarding habitat compensation: 1) Credits can be purchased from Coles 
Levee.  
They must be purchased at Coles Levee for projects on the preserve. For  
outside projects, CDFG and USFWS must approve purchase of these credits on  
case-by-case. 2) Credits can be purchased from Kern Water Bank. Again, USFWS  
and CDFG must concur that credits at Kern Water Bank are appropriate  
compensation for projects on a case-by-case basis. 

Your other source of credits is tied to the land around the NCL gas plant.  
However, as you may have seen by the letter from CDFG that I faxed, EOTT  
still has some negotiating to do with CDFG to put this option in place. Gary  
and I met with CDFG in December regarding this issue. They would like some  
kind of MOU between the parties. At the time, Gary did not think that the 
MOU  
could be completed and signed before Rogas was to begin and decided to work  
on the MOU to cover subsequent projects. 

May I suggest purchasing the needed compensation credits at the same time as  
the Rogas credits are purchased. With Kern Water Bank, there is a $5000 
admin  
fee each time credits are purchased. I don't know what the current charge is  
a Coles Levee. 

Please call me if you have any questions.

Subject: Re: Rogas Line -- USFW Approval



     I don't know the exact cost number for compensation acreage, but the
following info may help for planning purposes.  (Also, I don't know if any
number for such acreage was included in the cost figures presented to the
Board; presumably some estimate was included.)

     There are two different types of compensation credits we will need to
purchase: Coles Levee Ecopreserve (CLEP) credits, and Kern Water Bank (KWB)
credits.

     For KWB, we will need 24 acres to start the project.  From the figures
I have been quoted, these should cost $62,000.  This is only for
installation of the new lines, however, and does not include acreage to
cover removal of the existing line. (I will not here hazard a quess as to
how many additional acres this will require, but it could well be that same
amount again, as the lines are the same length.)  The excelr folks can
determine the actual number.

     For CLEP, we need 15.3 acres.  While our take permit only requires us
to post a letter of credit for $16,500, in lieu of immediate purchase, as
security to ensure we will follow through with the actual purchase, I
believe the actual cost of buying the credits will be higher -- perhaps
three times that amount, because the market for these credits has firmed
substantially since Koch was issued that permit.  Again, the excelr folks
can give us a hard number once they get an actual quote from Aera or some
other seller.

     So, I believe we are looking at a best case of about $100,000, and
worst case of $175,000 for purchasing compensation acreage.  John, do you
agree?

     Thanks.  --ETA

What if any cost impact does this have on EOTT.  Make sure we get the
capital approved and that we (EOTT) are aware of the cost.  The cost of the
project has been approved by the Board  and if I need to go back to them
with a revised economic analysis, I will need some time.  This goes for the
truck rack as well.

I obtained a copy of a letter sent to Gary Fuller from the Department of
Fish and Game on November 3, 2000. In the letter the Fish and Game agreed
EOTT has 41 Acres of conservation credits based on Arco Western Energy's
sale of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant and premises to Koch Oil
and Gas, and Koch's subsequent sale of the plant and premises to EOTT
ENERGY.

In the letter the following limitations and clarifications were listed:

Because the conservation credits may be used for mitigation of EOTT
impacts, or sold by EOTT to third parties for their own mitigation needs,
EOTT must affirm that it will conform to the Department's  standards for
sale of conservation credits as well as management of the credit lands.

These obligations are already implied by the chain of Koch's and then
EOTT's acquisitions  of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant. EOTT and
Department representatives will need to meet to discuss these details and
determine the most efficient means to implement these conditions.

Key provision of the obligations that attend using the conservation credits
include Department approval of third-party sales;  minimum endowment
requirements for all credit sales; management and monitoring of habitat
conditions; and additional mitigation for disturbance to dedicated habitat.

Habitat continuity and small animal movement between the North Coles
fractionator plant site and the remainder of Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve
must be provided in order to maintain viability of the habitat within
EOTT's holdings.

 Although it appears we do have the credits for NCL, I do not know if Gary
ever met with the Fish and Game to discuss the details or means to
implement the conditions for use of the conservation credits. With the
project set to start we may have to purchase the 15.3 acres of credit from
Area.

Kenny and Scott,

I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the
purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) in there approval letter.  This in indeed ""good news"" and EOTT
must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental
Take Permit.  By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work
with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation
as promptly as possible.

It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do,
that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North
Coles Levee Preserve.  You should verify the exact credit number and
furnish the Service with such verification.  That is acreage EOTT will not
have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit.

Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.  John Shafer

I am attaching a graph that shows how the CO emissions increase exponentially
(vppm) as the turbine operating power is lowered.  The 50% base load CO levels
are between 215 and 250 vppm.

This graph also shows a wider ambient temperature range.

As stated on the phone today the 45 vppm NOx levels are achievable across the
entire operating range.

I apologize for the SI units on the graph, but I ran out of time to convert 
the

 The only reason we are notifying KWB of the purchase of NCL credits is that 
the letter from USFW requires us to.

 I don't know what NCL credits are going for these days, but Rick Suderman 
might be able to give some insight.  (He was privy to some discussions with 
Aera about providing them power for the water system at NCL in exchange for a 
reduced price for credits.)  Check with him.

 I believe the insurance certificate is required by the encroachment permit, 
is it not?  When we first received that permit, I made the request of EOTT 
treasury for the certificate; but now that it is an ETS construction project, 
the thinking is that the certificate should come from ETS.  I do not know the 
ETS process for getting one.  Perhaps one of the CC-ed ETS folks can provide 
some insight as to whether ETS can take care of this, and how.

Ok.  We'll test an engine.  This project involves 5 identical engines.  We
want to test just one - will you accept that?  Will you accept portable

Hi Jon,
This is a joint Duncan - Jim Linville reply.
First, for all intents and purposes, expect GF status to go away when the
legislature comes back to town.  With that in mind, what exactly is
happening with this engine.  Does the carburetor replace the mixer valves?
 If so, this must be one ancient engine!  And unlikely to get in under VERP
or any other program designed to end GF status.  Tell us more.

44269,campbell-l/all_documents/315.,<32833512.1075851885164.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I received the proposed contract for both compensation credits and fees for 
EOTT and it's contractors to be put on Kern Water Banks Master Permit. 
Compensation credit will cost $62,000.00 with an additional $16,000.00 to add 
EOTT to the Master Permit so we are covered for incidental take at NCL. In 
order for the pipeline project to get started the following things must 
happen.

1. Give the Kern Water Bank a check for $78,000.00. A contractor constructing 
a water line adjacent to EOTT's ROW has cleared the habitat. This should 
reduce EOTT's disturbance acreage by a small amount, I suggest we go ahead an 
purchase the 24 acres so we can get started, if we have any credits left we 
can use them on the removal of the existing Rogas pipeline. 

2. We need to make a decision on weather we are going to purchase 15.3 acres 
of compensation credit from Area for NCL or try to use the existing credits 
we received with the purchase of the plant. I have tried to get in contact 
with Jeff Single at the Fish and Game to set up a meeting to work out details 
of managing the existing credits but have not been able to speak with him. I 
believe the process to enable us to use credits we already own will not be 
accomplished in time to use on this project. Scott Jones is working with Mark 
Poe at Area on what compensation credits from Area will cost. He originally 
was quoted $1,850.00 an acre to Area, $400.00 an acre endowment fee to the 
Fish and Game and $100.00 an acre for fencing to the Fish and Game. Scott 
talked with Gary Fuller and was informed that Mark had previously quoted 
$1500.00 an acre to Area. Scott asked Mark about the lower price, he is 
checking into it and will get back to Scott. Once we purchase the 
compensation credits from Area, Mark will need to notify Cheryl Harding at 
KWB and then she will sell EOTT the KWB compensation credits and add EOTT to 
the Master Permit. Since the Fish and Wildlife project approval letter stated 
she was to be notified of the purchase of credits form Area a letter of 
credit will not be acceptable. We also need to provide the letter of approval 
for the project from the Fish and Game to Mark Poe. It is my understanding we 
have only received verbal approval and have not gotten a hard copy. Randi 
McCormick is going to get the letter.

3. We need to provide insurance certificates to West Kern Water as stated in 
the encroachment permit before start of construction. Josie Castrejana is 
going to provide those.

4. We still do not have the permits for the road bores at State Hwy-43 and 
Interstate-5. The state has the permits ready but they want proof we have ROW 
with the land owners on either side of the highways. As soon as KWB gives 
back the signed recorded agreements I will provide that to Caltrans and then 
they will issue the permits. The other missing permit is for the crossing of 
the Kern River by-pass channel. Larry is working on that permit, we should 
have the permit by the time we reach the channel with the pipelines.

I just spoke with Cheryl Harding about getting the proposed contract for 
compensation credits. The NCL credits are for habitat disturbance only not 
incidental take. KWB credits which include both are $2000.00 per acre. If we 
paid that fee we would be covered but we still would have to buy credits from 
NCL. The end result would be EOTT would have 15.3 acres of unused credit in 
KWB's bank. Cheryl would like to charge EOTT the difference between NCL 
credit  and KWB credits. If NCL credits are $1500.00 per acre we would own 
KWB $500.00 per acre for being covered under there Master Permit. Cheryl has 
a call into Mark Poe for this information and he has not returned her call. I 
spoke with Mark this morning about this issue, he said compensation credit 
prices had increased and was not sure what he quoted Gary. Mark will verify 
and get back to me. Scott if you can find anything in Gary's files about this 
that would be great.

 The only reason we are notifying KWB of the purchase of NCL credits is that 
the letter from USFW requires us to.

 I don't know what NCL credits are going for these days, but Rick Suderman 
might be able to give some insight.  (He was privy to some discussions with 
Aera about providing them power for the water system at NCL in exchange for a 
reduced price for credits.)  Check with him.

 I believe the insurance certificate is required by the encroachment permit, 
is it not?  When we first received that permit, I made the request of EOTT 
treasury for the certificate; but now that it is an ETS construction project, 
the thinking is that the certificate should come from ETS.  I do not know the 
ETS process for getting one.  Perhaps one of the CC-ed ETS folks can provide 
some insight as to whether ETS can take care of this, and how.

 Thanks.

		 Subject: Rogas Line -- USFW Approval

 Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated 
February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our 
project ""for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank,"" and 
authorizing the Water Bank ""to extend their incidental take authority to you 
and your entire project under their Master Permit.""  This is, of course, very 
good news.

 The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation 
acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.  Specifically, 
we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern Water Bank to 
acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get included in their 
Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from the Coles Levee 
Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have purchased 15.3 
acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set aside that amount 
from credits we have in the past purchased.

 While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise 
because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that whenever 
a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically get their 
lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only slows things 
down -- or worse.

 My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact Cheryl 
as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for acquisition of 
23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to include EOTT (and 
its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also be informed that, 
while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL credits, we will by the 
end of this week have a letter of credit posted as security, as allowed under 
our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of acreage.  Ask whether a copy 
of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or whether we will need to have the 
actual acreage purchased.

 As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new lines, it 
is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed.  Please call me 
if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to discuss how to 
approach this issue.  Thanks a lot.

Subject:  Fee Increase, from California Fish and Game

Matt, the F&G has increased their permit fees that they charge to access
and cross streambeds for pipeline construction projects.  The fees only
take into account the streambed crossing.  to make this as simple as I can,
the catagories are :

     streambed crossing construction costs of less than $25,000        no
fee

     streambed crossing construction costs of  $25,000 to $500,000
$618.75

     streambed crossing constructoin costs of greater than $500,000
$1390.50

Whats your best guess?  The F&G is holding up the issuing of our permit for
this activity untill I send them the construction costs numbers and
additional fee.  Your help will be appreciated.

1) Started the preactivity survey for the Rogas pipeline project - we have  
completed from the Rogas railcar facility west to Enos Lane and south along  
Enos Lane to the large KWB canal (at the point where the route turns west). 
I  
have also reviewed a proposed materials and equipment storage area at Kenny  
Maltby's request. 

2) I have continued to try to contact Jeff Single at CDFG regarding the  
project...he was out most of last week and this week and will return  
Thursday, March 1. 

3) Coordinated with Scott Jones, Kenny Maltby, and Jeff Turpin (?, I believe  
a consultant that Scott is working with) regarding compensation credit  
purchase. I basically have provided explanations of terminology and answered  
questions, to the extent of my knowledge. This has included input regarding  
the ~41 credits that EOTT will have the right to use at Coles Levee once  
paperwork is completed with CDFG. 

Other activity: 

1) 2-22 sent draft annual reports for EOTT 2081 permit for 1999 and 2000. 

Plans for the remainder of this week: 

1) Complete preactivity survey on Kern Water Bank (including route 
adjustment  
for SCE). Coles Levee preactivity survey will be completed during the first  
part of next week. Subsequent to preactivity surveys and approvals from  
property owners, agencies, and EOTT, we will begin implementation of  
mitigation measures (trapping where necessary etc.).  

2) Continue to attempt contact with Jeff Single to assist with getting  
approval to AERA for compensation credit paperwork. 

3) Coordinate and assist as needed. 

Please call or e-mail if you have any questions. I understand that you are

there has not been a pin point location established as yet for all the 
construction and ground disturbance which will take place.  In the event 
there might be changes after the survey is completed, surveying the entire

Dear Arnold:

Thanks for your time today. This note is to confirm my understanding of
our discussion:

1- Our John March  is to receive some additional operating points next
week.  John will also receive advice about the CO requirement at part
load.  John will then run compressor and GT performance data at those
points.  He will indicate our method for achieving the CO requirement at
the specified points, as well as, at other part  loads.
2- Furthermore,  John will advise our method of ensuring that the engine
will not exceed the required CO concentration at part loads.   We may
utilize a bleed system to achieve the required CO, and also a control
algorithm that precludes the engine from dipping below a certain load
level.
3-  Items 1 and 2, will be topics of a meeting to be held in Houston
during Monday, 12-March.  Scope of supply, delivery committment, spare GG
pricing, and RR hold of a spare PT will also be topics for the meeting.

As a new point,  I'd like to confirm our interest in showing you how the
6761 will achieve your needs at the meeting in Houston.

recommend immediate flushing with diesel.
The existing Selexol tank and injection system can be used for this purpose. 
HYSIM simulations verify the existing high pressure injection pump is a good 
fit for the quantity of diesel to be added on a continuous basis, 
(approximately 1 B/D).  Inject  1 or 2 barrels of diesel in front of each pig 
to begin with.  I would buy diesel No. 2 because it has a wider boiling point 
range than No. 1.  The diesel should be analyzed for PCB content  before we 
purchase /inject.

The above guideline should be adjusted based on the actual volume of liquids 
seen at the meter station filter separator.  If you can keep a small but 
continuous amount of free liquids at this separator , the gas will be 
saturated with heavy hydrocarbons which will dilute and flush PG&E's 
downstream system.

1 to 2 Barrel per day of diesel injected into 200 MMSCF/D has a major effect 
on the C7+ concentration  in the gas stream and on the hydrocarbon dew point. 
Most of the hydrocarbons in diesel  are naturally ocurring to some extent in 
natural gas. The carbon number for diesel ranges from about C10 to C 20 with 
a corresponding boiling point of 350 oF to 650 oF.  It is anticipated that 
some of the heavier hydrocarbons in the C18 to C20 range will  drop out along 
with compressor oil carryover to substantially increase the amount of liquid 
PG&E sees in their downstream drips.  The net effect of this is a substantial 
reduction of the PCB concentration.  I would expect that after 30 to 60 days 
of continuous injection the PCB contaminant level should drop by an order of 
magnitude.

The reason I would not inject Selexol after the pipeline has been cleaned is 
because you would  leave a finite quantity of Selexol coating the pipeline 
which could  then absorb and concentrate any potential PCB contaminant in the 
gas and potentially  recontaminate downstream equipment.

I will be on vacation from June 19 to June 26.  If you have any questions 
please call.

Subject: The Room

This is an old story, maybe you haven't heard or seen it before. I thought it 
was worth passing on.

???? I  think it will touch your heart.............

>>>? About this story - Here is some  background on the author that you
>>>? might be interested  in.? Procrastinating as usual, 17-year-old
>>>? Brian  Moore had only a short time to write something for the
>>>?  Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting. It was his turn  to
>>>? lead the discussion so he sat down and  wrote.
>>>? He showed the essay, titled ""The Room"" to his  mother, Beth, before
>>>? he headed out the door. ""I wowed  'em."" he later told his father, Bruce.
>>>? ""It's a killer,  It's the bomb. It's the best thing I ever wrote.""? It
>>>?  also was the last. Brian's parents had forgotten about the essay  when
>>>? a cousin found it while cleaning out the teenager's  locker at Teary
>>>? Valley High School. Brian had been dead  only hours, but his  parents
>>>
>>>?????desperately  wanted every piece of his life near them - the crepe
>>>? paper  that had adorned his locker during his senior football season,  
notes
>>>? from classmates and teachers, his  homework.
>>>
>>>? Only two months before, he had  handwritten the essay about encountering
>>>? Jesus in a file  room full of cards detailing every moment of the teen's
>>>?  life. But it was only after Brian's death that Beth and Bruce  Moore
>>>
>>>?????realized  that their son had described his view of heaven. ""It makes
>>>?  such an impact that people want to share it. You feel like you are  
there.""
>>>? Mr.? Moore said.? Brian Moore died May  27, 1997 - the day after Memorial
>>>?  Day.
>>>
>>>? He was driving home from a friend's  house when his car went off
>>>? Bulen-Pierce Road in Pickaway  County and struck a utility pole.  He
>>>
>>>?????emerged  from the wreck unharmed but stepped on a downed power line
>>>?  and was  electrocuted.
>>>?????Brian  seemed to excel at everything he did. He was an honor  student.
>>>? He told his parents he loved them ""a hundred  times a day"", Mrs. Moore
>>>? said.? He was a star wide  receiver for the Teary's Valley Football team
>>>? and had  earned a four-year scholarship to Capital University in  
Columbus
>>>? because of his athletic and academic  abilities.? He took it upon himself
>>>? to learn how to  help a fellow student who used a wheelchair at school.
>>>?  During one homecoming ceremony, Brian walked on his tiptoes so that  the
>>>? girl he was escorting wouldn't be embarrassed about  being taller than 
him.
>>>? He adored his kid brother, Bruce,  now 14. He often escorted his
>>>? grand-mother, Evelyn Moore,  who lives in Columbus, to church.? ""I always
>>>? called  him the ""deep thinker"", Evelyn said of her eldest  grandson.
>>>
>>>?????Two  years after his death, his family still struggles to  understand
>>>? why Brian was taken from them. They find  comfort at the cemetery where
>>>? Brian is buried, just a few  blocks from their home. They visit daily. A
>>>? candle and  dozens of silk and real flowers keep vigil over the  
gravesite.
>>>
>>>?????The  Moore's framed a copy of Brian's essay and hung it among  the
>>>? family portraits in the living room. ""I think God used  him to make a
>>>? point. I think we were meant to find it and  make something out of it,""
>>>? Mrs. Moore said of the  essay.
>>>
>>>? She and her husband want to share  their son's vision of life after
>>>? death. ""I'm happy for  Brian. I know he's in heaven. I know I'll see
>>>? him again  someday."" Mrs. Moore said.? ""It just hurts so bad  now.""
>>>
>>>?  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
>>>
>>>?????The  Room...
>>>
>>>? In that place between wakefulness  and dreams, I found myself in the
>>>? room.? There were  no distinguishing features except for the one wall
>>>? covered  with small index card files. They were like the ones in
>>>?  libraries that list titles by author or subject in alphabetical  order.
>>>? But these files, which stretched from floor to  ceiling and seemingly
>>>? endlessly in either direction, had  very different headings.
>>? >
>>>? As I drew  near the wall of files, the first to catch my attention  was
>>>? one that read ""Girls I have liked."" I opened it and  began flipping
>>>? through the cards. I quickly shut it,  shocked to realize that  
>>>
>>>?????recognized  the names written on each one. And then without being
>>>?  told, I knew exactly where I was. This lifeless room with its small  
files
>>>? was a crude catalog system for my life. Here were  written the actions of
>>>? my every moment, big and small, in  a detail my memory couldn't  match.
>>>
>>>?????A  sense of wonder and curiosity, coupled with horror, stirred  within
>>>? me as I began randomly opening files and exploring  their content. Some
>>>? brought joy and sweet memories; others  a sense of shame and regret so
>>>? intense that I would look  over my shoulder to see if anyone was  
watching.
>>>
>>>?????A  file named ""Friends"" was next to one marked ""Friends I  have
>>>? betrayed."" The titles ranged from the mundane to the  outright weird.
>>>? ""Books I Have Read,"" ""Lies I Have Told,""  ""Comfort I have Given,"" ""Jokes 
I
>>>? Have Laughed at.""?  Some were almost hilarious in their exactness: 
""Things
>>>?  I've yelled at my brothers"".? Others I couldn't laugh at: ""Things I  
Have
>>>? Done in My Anger"", ""Things I Have Muttered Under My  Breath at My 
Parents.""
>>>? I never ceased to be surprised by  the  contents.
>>>
>>>?????Often  there were many more cards than I expected. Sometimes  fewer
>>>? than I hoped. I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume  of the life I had
>>>?  lived.
>>>
>>>?????Could  it be possible that I had the time in my years to write  each
>>>? of these thousands or even millions of cards? But  each card confirmed 
this
>>>? truth. Each was written in my own  handwriting. Each signed with my
>>>?  signature.
>>>
>>>? When I pulled out the file  marked ""Songs I have listened to,"" I realized
>>>? the files  grew to contain their contents. The cards were packed  
tightly,
>>>? and yet after two or three yards, I hadn't found  the end of the file.? I
>>>? shut it, shamed, not so much  by the quality of music but more by the 
vast
>>>? time I knew  that file represented.? When I came to a file marked  
""Lustful
>>>? Thoughts,"" I felt a chill run through my body. I  pulled the file out 
only
>>>? an inch, not willing to test its  size, and drew out a card. I shuddered 
at
>>>
>>>?  its detailed content. I felt sick to think that such a moment had  been
>>>?  recorded.
>>>
>>>?????An  almost animal rage broke on me. One thought dominated my  mind:
>>>? ""No one must ever see these cards! No one must ever  see this room! I 
have
>>>? to destroy  them!""
>>>
>>>? In insane frenzy I yanked the file  out. Its size didn't matter now. I
>>>? had to empty it and  burn the cards. But as I took it at one end and
>>>? began  pounding it on the floor, I could not dislodge a single card.  
>>>? became desperate and pulled out a card, only to find it  as strong as
>>>? steel when I tried to tear it.? Defeated  and utterly helpless, I
>>>? returned the file to its slot.  Leaning my forehead against the wall, I
>>>? let out a long,  self-pitying sigh.? And then I saw it. The title  bore
>>>
>>>?????""People  I Have Shared the Gospel With."" The handle was brighter  than
>>>? those around it, newer, almost unused. I pulled on  its handle and a 
small
>>>? box not more than three inches long  fell into my hands.? I could count 
the
>>>? cards it  contained on one hand.? And then the tears came.? I began  to
>>>? weep. Sobs so deep that they hurt.? They started  in my stomach and shook
>>>? through me. I fell on my knees and  cried.? I cried out of shame, from 
the
>>>? overwhelming  shame of it  all.
>>>
>>>?????The  rows of file shelves swirled in my tear-filled eyes. No one  must
>>>? ever, ever know of this room. I must lock it up and  hide the key.? But
>>>? then as I pushed away the tears, I  saw  Him.
>>>
>>>?????No,  please not Him. Not here. Oh, anyone but Jesus. I watched
>>>?  helplessly as He began to open the files and read the cards. I  couldn't
>>>? bear to watch His response. And in the moments I  could bring myself to
>>>? look at His face, I saw a sorrow  deeper than my own. He seemed to
>>>? intuitively go to the  worst boxes. Why did He have to read every one?
>>>? Finally He  turned and looked at me from across the room. He looked at  
me
>>>? with pity in His eyes.? But this was a pity that  didn't anger me.
>>?  >
>>>?????I dropped my  head, covered my face with my hands and began to cry
>>>?  again.? He walked over and put His arm around me. He could have said  so
>>>? many things.? But He didn't say a word. He just  cried with  me.
>>>
>>>?????Then  He got up and walked back to the wall of files. Starting at  one
>>>? end of the room, He took out a file and, one by one,  began to sign His
>>>? name over mine on each card. ""No!"" I  shouted rushing to Him. All I could
>>>? find to say was ""No,  no, "" as I pulled the card from Him. His name
>>>? shouldn't be  on these cards. But there it was, written in red so rich,  
so
>>>? dark, so  alive.
>>>
>>>?????The  name of Jesus covered mine. It was written with His blood.  He
>>>? gently took the card back. He smiled a sad smile and  began to sign the
>>>?  cards.
>>>
>>>?????I  don't think I'll ever understand how He did it so quickly, but  the
>>>? next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file  and walk back to 
my
>>>? side.? He placed His hand on my  shoulder and said, ""It is finished."" I
>>>? stood up, and He  led me out of the room.?? There was no lock on  its

>>>?????""I  can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."" Phil.  4:13

The rough draft of the baseline noise survey for the turbine installations in

remove the existing auxillary generators and replace with 2 units at each

State Fire Marshall, Office of Pipeline Safety granting us a waiver so that
we can lay the pipe above ground as opposed to below ground.  I have calls
into  the other agencies  for which applications and requests were

trouble for initiating a construction project without consent and approval
from a particular agency, as agencies many times look at an entire project
even though their jurisdiction may only apply in one specific area of a
project.  This is particularily the case in air permitting where an
applicant can not even construct a road or bring in construction materials
until the air permit is issued.  Because this is my first project in
California, Id like to be sure of this and make follow up calls to all
agencies for which applications and requests were submitted and verify that
we can initiate the construction, as long as we dont impact a specific  or
strategic portion (ie  the bypass channel)  for sometime down the road when
we are well into the project.   Ill call you tomorrow and let you

Subject:  Rogas Pipelines


We are going to start the Rogas project Monday 03/12/2001. The first 2500
ft leaving Rogas is across a carrot field that has been harvested and is
not in any habitat. The farmer is due to start working the field the 24th
so we need to get the pipe laid. The contractor is going to start with a
reduced crew and expects to be finished crossing the initial 2500 ft by the
end of the week. The following things must be accomplished early next week
so we can continue construction.

Checks received so we can purchase compensation credits from Kern Water
Bank and Area.

Be added to the KWB's Master Permit. That will happen when they receive
there check.

Insurance certificates in the hands of the Kern County Water Agency and
West Kern Water.

If the contractor has to stop we may be faced with additional mobilization
and demobilization charges.

Finally got the documentation you sent in.  Jim Linville and I reviewed it.  
Neither of us believe you need any authorization to do what you did/are 
doing.  In our opinion, there is no change to your grandfathered status, nor 
a need to update your Title V permit.

Having said that, by now you probably know that the Texas legislature seems 
intent on closing out grandfathered status as of September 1st.  Our view is 
that your reworked engines have a clear shot at coming in under the VERP  
entry to permitting.  I would also suggest you check the 1972 Standard 
Exemption No. 7.  One way of the other, you should plan to end the 
grandfather status of these engines soon.

On the Title V permit, if you have a General Operating Permit (most likely), 
it will be due for renewal in the short term (next year marks the 5th 
anniversary for most GOPs).  We suggest you incorporate any changes due to 
the engine reworks at that time.  If you have an issued SOP, do the same.  If 
your SOP is still pending, contact your Permit reviewer here at TNRCC for 
guidance.
So, will this e-mail answer your needs?

Kenny, I have contacted the agencies for which permits and approvals were
requested and have been given the green light to initiate the Rogas
project.  Please understand that IN NO WAY can we initiate activities
associated with the bypass channel construction until approval is given by
each agency contacted.  I will apprise you as the approvals are received or
if further information is requested by each agency.  Enjoy digging in the
carrot field.

Subject:  Re: Rogas Pipelines



Kenny, as you may know, there were 9 environmental applications submitted
to various local, state, and regional agencies requesting approval to
initiate this project and most of the requests apply to crossing the bypass
channel.   As of today, we have received one approval, and that from the
State Fire Marshall, Office of Pipeline Safety granting us a waiver so that
we can lay the pipe above ground as opposed to below ground.  I have calls
into  the other agencies  for which applications and requests were
submitted but have had no reply.  I would caution that we might get into
trouble for initiating a construction project without consent and approval
from a particular agency, as agencies many times look at an entire project
even though their jurisdiction may only apply in one specific area of a
project.  This is particularily the case in air permitting where an
applicant can not even construct a road or bring in construction materials
until the air permit is issued.  Because this is my first project in
California, Id like to be sure of this and make follow up calls to all
agencies for which applications and requests were submitted and verify that
we can initiate the construction, as long as we dont impact a specific  or
strategic portion (ie  the bypass channel)  for sometime down the road when
we are well into the project.   Ill call you tomorrow and let you
know.......

Subject:  Rogas Pipelines


We are going to start the Rogas project Monday 03/12/2001. The first 2500
ft leaving Rogas is across a carrot field that has been harvested and is
not in any habitat. The farmer is due to start working the field the 24th
so we need to get the pipe laid. The contractor is going to start with a
reduced crew and expects to be finished crossing the initial 2500 ft by the
end of the week. The following things must be accomplished early next week
so we can continue construction.

Checks received so we can purchase compensation credits from Kern Water
Bank and Area.

Be added to the KWB's Master Permit. That will happen when they receive
there check.

Insurance certificates in the hands of the Kern County Water Agency and
West Kern Water.

If the contractor has to stop we may be faced with additional mobilization
and demobilization charges.

I gave the tree issue at Station 2 some thought and I have a couple of
concerns regarding the environmental report.  The report is being written,
based on the fact that all construction will occur within the station yard
and on previously disturbed ground.  If we impact areas (even within
existing facilities) that were not previously disturbed we are required to
include environmental data about those areas.

So the first question is whether the entire station yard has been
""previously disturbed"".  To help determine this, I downloaded a USGS aerial
(1996) of the station from the internet and the trees occurring within the
station yard look to be the same age/size as those surrounding the station.
This would indicate that the areas within the station covered with trees
have not been ""previously disturbed"".  A copy of the aerial is attached.

However, it is conceivable that the site was cleared prior to initial
construction and the trees simply grew back.  Unfortunately, I don't have
that information and don't know if you do either.  And let me point out that
my concern is not whether Transwestern will receive approval to construct,
but the amount of information supplied in the report.  I want to feel
comfortable that we are supplying the required information to FERC.

For this project, that would primarily include a description of the existing
vegetation and soils (resource report 3 and 7).  All we would really need is
a brief description of the existing vegetation and soils, and how much will
be permanently impacted, etc. However, we did not budget any time to obtain
this information, nor did we anticipate the need for site visits.

My hope is that we can find an answer to whether the site was previously
disturbed or not.  If not, I hope to come up with some verbiage that
everyone is comfortable with to satisfy the FERC requirements.  Otherwise,
we will have to obtain the necessary information, and that's beyond our
initial scope.

If you have had any biological reports done for the area on other projects,
that may provide enough information.  Again, it only needs to be brief.
Also, we need to verify for the other 3 stations that we are constructing in
previously disturbed areas.

Lastly, Arnold has indicated that the hydro-test water will come from
existing water source at each station and that it will be discharged under
Transwestern's blanket permit.  Please verify...and I think we should
provide a copy of the blanket permit with the filing.

After you have had a chance to think about this, please call and we can
discuss.

Transwetern's policy to maintain an environmetnal presence at all of its

for vegetation and soils.  I have received a verbal from the US Fish and 
Wildlife and they agreed with the intent in my letter to them that pipline 
activites at each location tend to preclude any impacts to sensitive or 
critical habitats.  In addition, the adjacent lands are of the same habitat 
types as that which are contained within the facility and therefore, would 
not be an issue of habitat loss.   There are not any old TW hands around to 
positively verify that the site was cleanred and there has been natural 
encroachment of the trees into the area, I seriously doubt it.  Again, TW 
tried to mantain a postive presence at each site, but did utilize the sites 
for their intended purpose.

In Arizona, we do not have a blanket approval for discharges of hydrostatic 
testwater.  We do however plan to use new pipe and water supplied either from 
the closest City (ie Flagstaff for station 2 construction) or from a drinking 
well source.  In any event, we will test the water prior to discharge and 
ensure that the discharge will stay on the facility property to soak into the 
ground.  I cant imagine that there will be large volumes of hydro water as we 
dont plan on installing a large amount of new pipe.

needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic

issue of tribal lands, he was going to discuss this issue with the Navajo

Monday of next week as to what the Tribes final decision would be, but he was

ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, excelr warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

excelr=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including excelr, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, excelr is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

excelr is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; excelr continues to sign up customers in the state; and excelr=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  excelr=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  excelr has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at excelr=
 will=20

That's great Larry. I understand that we can not do anything in the by-pass
channel and this will be made clear in the environmental orientation
Monday. If we don't get compensation credits, insurance certificates and
written approval from the Fish and Game for trapping we can not proceed any
father than the carrot field. Once we get the approvals the plan is to
clear right of way and string pipe week ahead. The by-pass channel is a
month into the project.

Kenny, I have contacted the agencies for which permits and approvals were
requested and have been given the green light to initiate the Rogas
project.  Please understand that IN NO WAY can we initiate activities
associated with the bypass channel construction until approval is given by
each agency contacted.  I will apprise you as the approvals are received or
if further information is requested by each agency.  Enjoy digging in the
carrot field.

Subject:  Re: Rogas Pipelines



Kenny, as you may know, there were 9 environmental applications submitted
to various local, state, and regional agencies requesting approval to
initiate this project and most of the requests apply to crossing the bypass
channel.   As of today, we have received one approval, and that from the
State Fire Marshall, Office of Pipeline Safety granting us a waiver so that
we can lay the pipe above ground as opposed to below ground.  I have calls
into  the other agencies  for which applications and requests were
submitted but have had no reply.  I would caution that we might get into
trouble for initiating a construction project without consent and approval
from a particular agency, as agencies many times look at an entire project
even though their jurisdiction may only apply in one specific area of a
project.  This is particularily the case in air permitting where an
applicant can not even construct a road or bring in construction materials
until the air permit is issued.  Because this is my first project in
California, Id like to be sure of this and make follow up calls to all
agencies for which applications and requests were submitted and verify that
we can initiate the construction, as long as we dont impact a specific  or
strategic portion (ie  the bypass channel)  for sometime down the road when
we are well into the project.   Ill call you tomorrow and let you
know.......

Subject:  Rogas Pipelines


We are going to start the Rogas project Monday 03/12/2001. The first 2500
ft leaving Rogas is across a carrot field that has been harvested and is
not in any habitat. The farmer is due to start working the field the 24th
so we need to get the pipe laid. The contractor is going to start with a
reduced crew and expects to be finished crossing the initial 2500 ft by the
end of the week. The following things must be accomplished early next week
so we can continue construction.

Checks received so we can purchase compensation credits from Kern Water
Bank and Area.

Be added to the KWB's Master Permit. That will happen when they receive
there check.

Insurance certificates in the hands of the Kern County Water Agency and
West Kern Water.

If the contractor has to stop we may be faced with additional mobilization
and demobilization charges.

the mainline units. Unit 621 is the 
auxillary engine and runs back up power, if needed.  The year 1997 was 
figured by Kerry Welch who no longer is with us.  
1998, 1999, and 2000 operating hours and fuel use numbers were calculated 
using the spread sheet that was provided by our mechanical analyst.

17.01           29.82         105.55       1.39

The total throughput on condensate has been ( 0 gallons ) for 1997, 1998, 
1999, and 2000. This is due to the fact that our narutal gas supply changed 
in 1997 to a more dry natural gas and therefore, there was no liquids 
associated with the gas.

Again I apologize the inconsistency in the data.  We have had employee 
turnovers at the facility and different spreadsheets were used to provide the 
information to the EPA.  We are in the process of standardizing our data 
collections to eleminate this problem in the future.  I hope this information 
will help in the permit review process.  Again please accept my apologizes in 
the data collection errors.

the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the 
permits fuel use requirements.  My question is, how does the fuel use compare 
with what Solar says the fuel use should be?  If we can get Solar to provide 
written guarantees and ""UP"" the fuel use value for the turbine, we can up the 
fuel value on the permit.  The state of Colorado perceives increased fuel use 
beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in 
need of mechanical adjustment.  From their eyes, this would be a strong 
indication of excess emissions, and I think there evaluation would hold some 
merit.  Anyway, I dont want to send up a red flag to the state of Colorado.  

Would you contact Solar and compare their fuel use values with what the 
monitors say the turbine is burning at La Plata? 

Then let me know.  If worse gets to worse, I may be able to use another 
tactic, but only as a last resort.",Non Abusive

Unfortunately, there does not appear to be an USGS aerial available that
covers Station 1.  In case you need them, I did find coverage for station 3
and 4.

Additionally, there is no published soil surveys covering any of the station
sites.  I intend to word resource report 7 to reflect that.  I will also
address impacts to soils.  I think this will suffice.  We did get some
vegetation descriptions put together for the areas in and around the
stations.

The Forest Service has given us permission to do the arch survey for station 
2 on Monday.  The arch survey for station 1 is scheduled for Tuesday.   
Preliminary quotes for the surveys are $4-5000.00 for both sites.  The 
original word from them was 7-10 prior to giving approval.   This was 
definatley a plus.

Still no word on where the turbine buildings are to be located and what

Attached is the latest version of the Red Rock Mainline Expansion
environmental report.  This should be fairly complete except for a few
pieces of information.  I have listed things I still need below.

Information Needed...
1. Dates of air permit submittals and copies of applications
2. Copies of T&E phone logs and/or written responses
3. Copy of USFS notification and/or phone log
4. Dates of cultural resource surveys, findings (verbal), date when
reports will be ready, copies of any agency responses and/or phone logs
5. Manufacture/model of new units (if different from those given to
air/noise consultants, updates will be needed)
6. Verify whether we need volume of hydro-test water

FYI Donna sent me the new plot plans via e-mail.  I took a look at those and
updated the report accordingly.  I have not heard anything regarding the
soils from the Forest Service.  Minimum checklist requirements only ask for
NRCS mapped soil data.  Scott Patti in our Ft. Collins office happened to be
speaking with one of his FERC contacts on another project and asked about
the issue of no mapped soils.  His contact indicated to him that it would
not be a problem for work within existing facilities.

I will be working remotely tomorrow, but will have access to e-mail and can
be contacted via my cell phone 919-632-6840.  Otherwise, leave me a message
and I will call you to discuss.
Hope all went well with the EPA,

take a chance of moving any PCB'S further West. There are new scrubbers

Subject: DR/Pipe Cleaning on TW Mainline

Ben, 

Ken and I have looked over my tuned TW West mainline model and feel the next 
area we should target for aggressive cleaning and/or drag reducer is between 
stations 2 & 3.  This section is sufficiently far away from California that 
PCB issues should be mitigated.  It has the highest relative roughness 
(excluding Gallup to Station 4, which appears to be mostly SCADA calibration 
errors).  Station 3 has more HP than the other stations and therefore more 
likely to achieve MAOP.  The higher HP and reduced pipeline losses will 
translate to a significantly higher pressure at the discharge of station 2.

By my estimation, we will gain 5 MMBTU/D in total system capacity if we 
reduce the effective roughness of this one section from 0.00077 to 0.00058.

Is excelr Overpriced?
It's in a bunch of complex businesses. Its financial statements are nearly=
=20
impenetrable. So why is excelr trading at such a huge multiple?
Bethany McLean
Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 EST 2001

In Hollywood parlance, the ""It Girl"" is someone who commands the  spotlight=
=20
at any given moment--you know, like Jennifer Lopez or Kate  Hudson. Wall=20
Street is a far less glitzy place, but there's still such a  thing as an ""I=
t=20
Stock."" Right now, that title belongs to excelr, the  Houston energy giant.=
=20
While tech stocks were bombing at the box office  last year, fans couldn't=
=20
get enough of excelr, whose shares returned 89%.  By almost every measure, t=
he=20
company turned in a virtuoso performance:  Earnings increased 25%, and=20
revenues more than doubled, to over $100  billion. Not surprisingly, the=20
critics are gushing. ""excelr has built  unique and, in our view, extraordina=
ry=20
franchises in several usiness  units in very large markets,"" says Goldman=
=20
Sachs analyst David Fleischer.=20

Along with ""It"" status come high multiples and high expectations. excelr  no=
w=20
trades at roughly 55 times trailing earnings. That's more than 2 1/2  times=
=20
the multiple of a competitor like Duke Energy, more than twice  that of the=
=20
S=02?500, and about on a par with new-economy sex symbol  Cisco Systems. En=
ron=20
has an even higher opinion of itself. At a  late-January meeting with=20
analysts in Houston, the company declared that  it should be valued at $126=
 a=20
share, more than 50% above current levels.  ""excelr has no shame in telling=
=20
you what it's worth,"" says one portfolio  manager, who describes such=20
gatherings as ""revival meetings."" Indeed,  First Call says that 13 of excelr=
's=20
18 analysts rate the stock a buy.=20

But for all the attention that's lavished on excelr, the company remains =20
largely impenetrable to outsiders, as even some of its admirers are  quick =
to=20
admit. Start with a pretty straightforward question: How  exactly does Enro=
n=20
make its money? Details are hard to come by because  excelr keeps many of th=
e=20
specifics confidential for what it terms  ""competitive reasons."" And the=20
numbers that excelr does present are often  extremely complicated. Even=20
quantitatively minded Wall Streeters who  scrutinize the company for a livi=
ng=20
think so. ""If you figure it out, let  me know,"" laughs credit analyst Todd=
=20
Shipman at S&P. ""Do you have a  year?"" asks Ralph Pellecchia, Fitch's credi=
t=20
analyst, in response to the  same question.=20

To skeptics, the lack of clarity raises a red flag about excelr's pricey =20
stock. Even owners of the stock aren't uniformly sanguine. ""I'm somewhat =
=20
afraid of it,"" admits one portfolio manager. And the inability to get  behi=
nd=20
the numbers combined with ever higher expectations for the  company may=20
increase the chance of a nasty surprise. ""excelr is an  earnings-at-risk=20
story,'' says Chris Wolfe, the equity market strategist  at J.P. Morgan's=
=20
private bank, who despite his remark is an excelr fan.  ""If it doesn't meet=
=20
earnings, [the stock] could implode.""=20

What's clear is that excelr isn't the company it was a decade ago. In  1990=
=20
around 80% of its revenues came from the regulated gas-pipeline  business.=
=20
But excelr has been steadily selling off its old-economy iron  and steel=20
assets and expanding into new areas. In 2000, 95% of its  revenues and more=
=20
than 80% of its operating profits came from ""wholesale  energy operations a=
nd=20
services."" This business, which excelr pioneered,  is usually described in=
=20
vague, grandiose terms like the  ""financialization of energy""--but also, mo=
re=20
simply, as ""buying and  selling gas and electricity."" In fact, excelr's view=
=20
is that it can  create a market for just about anything; as if to underscor=
e=20
that point,  the company announced last year that it would begin trading=20
excess  broadband capacity.=20

But describing what excelr does isn't easy, because what it does is =20
mind-numbingly complex. CEO Jeff Skilling calls excelr a ""logistics  company=
""=20
that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity and  figures out=
=20
the most cost-effective way to transport that commodity to  its destination=
.=20
excelr also uses derivatives, like swaps, options, and  forwards, to create=
=20
contracts for third parties and to hedge its  exposure to credit risks and=
=20
other variables. If you thought excelr was  just an energy company, have a=
=20
look at its SEC filings. In its 1999  annual report the company wrote that=
=20
""the use of financial instruments  by excelr's businesses may expose excelr t=
o=20
market and credit risks  resulting from adverse changes in commodity and=20
equity prices, interest  rates, and foreign exchange rates.""=20

Analyzing excelr can be deeply frustrating. ""It's very difficult for us  on=
=20
Wall Street with as little information as we have,"" says Fleischer,  who is=
 a=20
big bull. (The same is true for excelr's competitors, but  ""wholesale=20
operations"" are usually a smaller part of their business, and  they trade a=
t=20
far lower multiples.) ""excelr is a big black box,"" gripes  another analyst.=
=20
Without having access to each and every one of excelr's  contracts and its=
=20
minute-by-minute activities, there isn't any way to  independently answer=
=20
critical questions about the company. For instance,  many Wall Streeters=20
believe that the current volatility in gas and power  markets is boosting=
=20
excelr's profits, but there is no way to know for  sure. ""The ability to=20
develop a somewhat predictable model of this  business for the future is=20
mostly an exercise in futility,"" wrote Bear  Stearns analyst Robert Winters=
=20
in a recent report.

Subject: Laguna PCB Issue

I received a call this morning from Jaroslav ""Jarda"" Solc (701-777-5217). 
Jarda is a Senior Research Manager for the Groundwater Resource & Remediation 
Group at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC). Jarda reports to 
Edward ""Ed"" Steadman, Associate Director for Research at the EERC. Norm 
Moreno with the POEP had contacted Ed, provided him with my name and number, 
and asked if Ed's organization would contact us in regard to the EERC 
providing some assistance to TW with remediation of PCB contamination at the 
Laguna site. 

I provided a brief description of site conditions and we then discussed 
alternative remediation methods. Based on the information I provided, Jarda 
agreed that continued monitoring seemed to be appropriate. Jarda also 
indicated that his group did not have any off-the-shelf type remediation 
technologies that would be applicable. I suggested to Jarda that his 
organization might still be of service to TW in our discussions with the 
Pueblo and the POEP as a third party opinion. Jarda said that he would 
discuss this with Ed and get back to me.

letter addresses our attempts to find a solution to the PCB problem, and that 
remediation technologies are not presently available to operate effectively

Remediation efforts to remove PSH have gone well recently and it is now time 
to focus more attention toward remediation of the dissolved phase plume. This 
is reflected in the proposed scope.

Two files are attached. The first file includes a project scope and cost 
estimate for 2001. The second file contains photos of the site. 

The cost estimate is $93,000. This figure includes only contract installation 
dollars, so the work order amount would be about 20-30% more than this. The 
bulk of this figure ($53,000) is for system modifications to focus more 
attention toward remediation of the dissolved phase plume. 

If you get a chance to look at the photos, be sure to look at the last photo. 
This photo shows the interior of the SVE knockout box that was installed in 
Dec 1999 in the NE pit area. This installation has worked very well over the 
past two winter periods and has greatly increased the effectiveness of the 
SVE system. The SVE knockout box recently installed at the N Crawar site is 
nearly identical.

Subject: Re: Hendrick Wink Tank Farm  

I didn't forget about you.  I was trying to verify which facility you were 
asking about since there are several Hendrick and Wink facilities on my file 
list.  I was able to verify that an EOTT ""PLP"" check in the amount of $416.00 
was cut on 10/29/99 to pay the FY 2000 Emissions Fee (9/1/99 - 8/31/00) for 
Hendrick/Wink Station (TNRCC Account # WM01910).  However, there is no 
evidence of payment for FY 2001.  I believe, though, that Craig Willoughby of 
ENTRIX did some work on emissions for at least one of the Hendrick facilities 
while he was working for EOTT last year.  I left a message for him a couple 
of days ago but haven't heard from him yet.  I think that whatever he put 
together is in the ETS file.  I've left a message for Kerry Fields to check 
the ETS files for information.  Bottom line:  Looks like the invoice you have 
does need to be paid, but which company is responsible for this fee?

P.S. Would you like a copy of what I found?

Scott, you are right, these items were identified by Bill Osborn during
consolidated audit of the North Coles Levee.  As you remember,  we spoke to
Louie about getting started with a drilling program to formally close each
of the suspected areas of contamination.  At his recommendation and  due to
the issue of Koch's responsibility for some of the issues that were
identified, he was going to discuss this with Ed Attanasio before you and I
were to get started on initiating the subsurface investigation.  Im not
sure where Louie is on this, but  the completion date you  show in the
attachment for the action items are 6/30/01.   This gives us about two
months to complete the drilling program.  Thanks for staying on top of

identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch 
facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year.

All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the 
Koch office  were reviewed.  Assumptions were made that the environmental 
records were complete for all assets included in the sale.  Primary emphasis 
was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a 
sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of 
crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical 
assets which were reviewed. 

Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the 
following:

  Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee 
payments were documented 

  NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks 
were documented 

  Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date

  SARA compliance and reporting had been completed

  SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112

  Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were 
available for review

   There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site 
included in the asset for sale
     (permits for the remediation activity is in place)

  Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were 
documented

Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified 
which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a 
considered a major environmental  liability.  This statement is again based 
upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the 
data room for the assets in question.  It should also be stated that this 
analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch 
has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge 
during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files.

Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a 
recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to 
each location to verify findings from the records review.   Also, due to the 
past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract 
conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for 
discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have 
occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.

The air permit modification for the La Plata C/S was received from the state

In the latest conversation with Harold Barth, a field engineer with Solar, we 
were told that the equipment data received last week was a best case 
scenario.  The fuel consumption rate was displayed in MMbtu/hr., and due to 
the heating value used, we should divide this number by .92 to get Scf/hr..  
When this is done, the rate that coincides with a 20 degree inlet temperature 
is 49.42 standard cubic feet per hour, which is slightly greater than what 
our permit says should be our maximum fuel consumption rate.  Harold also 
stated that achieving this rate on a daily basis is unrealistic, since these 
figures are based on new equipment in perfect condition.  Solar does not 
publish maximum fuel consumption figures, much like the auto manufacturers, 
since this is dependent upon site specific operating conditions.  He 
suggested that we add our 10% cushion factor to this data, and submit it to 
the State.  I'm sure that Harold would provide a written statement regarding 
the status of our equipment,  that could be used as documentation for the 
state, if you deem it necessary.  Let me know what you think!  Rich has 
suggested that we have a conference call to discuss possible solutions to the

gonna get any better, and it could get worse), we'd have till 9/1/02 to apply

		 Subject: Grandfathered Facilities - Endangered Species With No Prospects o f 
Protection


The days of grandfathered facilities in Texas are numbered.  This does not
only mean those large facilities in nonattainment areas, but ANY facility
that was constructed prior to September, 1971 and has not subsequently been
rolled into some sort of new source review (NSR) permit or Permit by Rule
(formerly Standard Exemption).  Note that proposed new rules recently
published in the Texas Register for public comment will require operators to
be able to produce documentation of applicability and compliance for all
facilities authorized by a Permit by Rule/Standard Exemption, much the same
as is required for any other type of permit.

The TNRCC Sunset Bill contains language limiting the time that such
facilities may operate without NSR authorization of some sort.  The Senate
Committee Substitute (SCS) for HB 2912 is a little stricter than the version
passed by the House, but both versions did contain grandfathered facility
permitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version will
also.  If this version passes, you will have one additional year to apply
for a Voluntary Emissions Reduction Permit (VERP).  If your facility is a
pipeline facility, the TNRCC will require no more than a 30% reduction in
NOx, and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the same
area covered in one permit.

Note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly
Cindy Morphew of TxOGA and Celina Romero of ATINGP - that it looks as though
we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted
without having to use today's BACT.

This memo summarizes the SCS provisions for your information.  This is NOT
actual bill language - I've TRIED to make it easier to read.

Note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the House does not
concur in all of the changes made by the Senate and the bill goes to
Conference.  In addition, we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill on
the Senate floor to require shutdown on September 1, 2001 of grandfathered
facilities that do not have a pending permit application.  If that attempt
is successful, the opportunity to apply for a VERP will be gone on September
1.

The memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the current
opportunity to claim historical Permits by Rule (Standard Exemptions) as a
means of permitting a grandfathered facility.  I am not certain how long
this opportunity will continue to exist.  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE YOU
CAN.

In addition, I've appended some information on 10-year old BACT for
gas-fired IC engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to
get a VERP now.




PROVISIONS OF SCS FOR HB 2912 (PRIOR TO SENATE FLOOR DEBATE)

Sec. 382.05181.  PERMIT REQUIRED.

(a)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have an application pending
for a new source review permit or other authorization, other than a federal
operating permit, and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown as
provided in Section 382.05182 may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2003, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(b)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have a permit or other
authorization under this chapter, other than a federal operating permit
permit, may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2007, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(c)  Facilities eligible for a Small Business Stationary Source Permit are
subject to the permitting deadlines in Section 382.05184.

Sec. 382.05182.  NOTICE OF SHUTDOWN.

(a)  A notice of shutdown to allow operation of a grandfathered facility
beyond the deadlines of 382.05181(a) must be filed with the commission
before the applicable deadline.

(b)  A notice under this section shall include:

  (1)  the date the facility intends to cease operating;

  (2)  an inventory of the type and amount of emissions that
will be eliminated when the facility ceases to operate; and

  (3)  any other necessary and relevant information the
commission by rule deems appropriate.

GENERAL PROVISIONS (APPLICABLE TO PERMITS UNDER 382.05183, 382.05184, AND
382.05186)

(a)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that
there is no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene
the intent of this chapter, including protection of the public's health and
physical property.

(b)  If the commission finds that the emissions from the facility will not
comply with Subsection (c), the commission may not grant the permit under
this section.

(c)  A person planning the modification of a facility previously permitted
under this section must comply with new source permitting requirements
before modifying.

(d)  The commission may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer
this section.

(e)  If an applicant omits any relevant facts or submits incorrect
information in an application, the applicant shall submit the relevant facts
or correct the information no later than 60 days after discovering the
error.  If while processing the application, the commission determines that
additional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action on
the application, the commission may request the information and set a
reasonable deadline for a response.  Failure to comply with the deadline for
the response will result in the application being returned to the applicant.

Sec. 382.05183.  EXISTING FACILITY PERMIT.

(a)  The owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may apply for a
permit to operate the facility under this section.

(b)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that the
application:

  (1)  is filed before September 1, 2002 and the facility will
use an air pollution control method at least as effective as 10-year old
BACT; or

  (2)  is filed before the applicable deadline of 382.05181(a)
and the facility will use current BACT.

(c)  The commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for some
or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site.  Permits issued under this
subsection shall follow the same permit issuance, modification, and renewal
procedures as existing facility permits.

Sec. 382.05184.  SMALL BUSINESS STATIONARY SOURCE PERMIT.

(a)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source and are not required by commission rule to submit an
annual emissions inventory report may apply for a permit under this section
before September 1, 2005.

(b)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source that does not have an application pending for a new source
review permit or other authorization, other than a federal operating permit,
and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown, may not emit air
contaminants on or after September 1, 2007.

Sec.  382.05185.  ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITY PERMIT.

Special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generating
facilities are not outlined in this memo.

Sec. 382.05186.  AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE FACILITIES.

(a)  The commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applications
for grandfathered processing, treating, compression, or pumping facilities
connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(b)  Based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local,
regional, and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly to
federal air quality standards, the commission may require up to a 30%
reduction of the hourly emission rates of NOx and VOC from reciprocating
internal combustion engines subject to this section.  For facilities other
than reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or part
of a gathering or transmission pipeline , the commission may consider
requiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to 30% for NOx and 20% for
VOC.  The commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state
where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than
in other areas, but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate
may be required in any area.

(c)  The commission shall:

  (1)  allow for a single permit for all facilities connected
to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline;

  (2)  allow for required reductions for facilities under this
section to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than one
facility and located in the same local, regional, or statewide areas
designated by the commission under Subsection (b);

  (3)  for purposes of emission averaging, allow emission
reductions achieved from grandfathered since September 1, 1997; and

  (4)  allow an owner or operator to apply for separate
permits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected to
or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(d)  Facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permitted
under this chapter.




CURRENT OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM A PERMIT BY RULE TO ""PERMIT"" A GRANDFATHERED
FACILITY

TNRCC has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfathered
facilities using any applicable ""Permit by Rule,"" including those previously
referred to as Standard Exemptions.

For instance, old Standard Exemption 7, effective May 8, 1972, was for ""Gas
fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine trains of
less than 5000 hp total"" and can be used to permit any such engine(s).  For
clarification on this particular exemption, the language used by staff in
proposing this exemption to the Texas Air Control Board in 1972 was as
follows:  ""Engines smaller than 2000 hp are quite numerous and are not
considered a substantial source unless joined together IN SERIES (emphasis
added) to form an engine train.  Engine trains of less than 5000 hp are not
considered a substantial source.  Because control technology for NOx
emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited, it
is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit
system at this time.""  (""Exemptions From Permits Procedures and
Justification for Exemptions,"" <signed> Charles R. Barden, P.E., Executive
Secretary, Texas Air Control Board, May 8, 1972.)

A list of the ""Historical Standard Exemptions"" is available on the TNRCC
Website at http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html
<http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html> .  In
applying these ""Permits by Rule,"" be sure to check the corresponding
""Exemption Preambles"" (if any) for any applicable General Conditions.

TNRCC has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilities
by PI-8 AND a simple notification cover letter to them so that they will
have a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longer
considered to be grandfathered.  The registration will buy you a letter of
acknowledgement that you have claimed the ""permit by rule"" (don't use the
term ""exemption"" in any correspondence) for these engines.

Subject: Response to 11/21/00 Teleconference 001204

I believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the TRNCC
will provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for 10-year BACT
for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.  The
last piece of information is an email that I am forwarding to you with this
email.  It is an email from John Steib to which he attaches an email from
Jim Linville.  In response to a request from us, Jim Linville sets forth in
his email an example of a large engine with emissions in the 29 gram per
horsepower hour range that cannot reduce emissions to the 2-8 gram level and
what the owner/operator of that engine must demonstrate in order to obtain a
VERP permit.
Remember, that in order to be included in the TNRCC's January 15, 2001
report to the legislature, a letter of intent or application for a VERP
should be filed with the TNRCC on or before next Thursday, December 7, 2000.
To summarize, we have obtained the following policies from the TNRCC:
1. Grandfathered internal combustion engines of less than 2000
horsepower can be authorized by Standard Exemption No. 6 effective December
1, 1972, regardless of the level of emissions from those facilities. (See my
letter to Kerry Drake dated September 15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me
dated October 3, 2000).
2. Grandfathered engine trains of less than 5000 horsepower, or a
portion of an engine train up to 5000 horsepower may be authorized under
Standard Exemption No. 6, December 1, 1972, so long as each engine in the
train does not exceed 2000 horsepower.  (See my letter to James Randall
dated November 1, 2000 and Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
3. Grandfathered turbines of less than 20,000 horsepower may be
authorized by Standard Exemption No. 82, dated December 1, 1972 regardless
of the level of emissions.  (See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September
15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me dated October 3, 2000).
4. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled to
the 2-8 gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review.
(See James Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
5. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to be
controlled to the 2-8 gram range may be permittable under a VERP if there is
test data to validate the old (pre-modification) and new (post-modification)
emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions
would be achieved.  Also needed would be a representation of the cost of the
controls and even though additional modifications are available, the
additional cost is prohibitive. (See Jim Randall's letter to me dated
November 16, 2000 and the email attached hereto).

I hope all of this is helpful.  I have forwarded to you copies of the
referenced letters by fax on earlier dates.  If you need another copy please
let me know.

Celina and James,

During our teleconference today, you asked for an example of what we would
consider ""significant emission reductions"" that would be acceptable in a
case-by-case review when the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level could not be achieved.
A large 2-stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately 29 g/hp-hr
of NOx would be considered to have significant emissions reductions if
actual emissions are reduced by 50 percent even though it does not meet the
2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level.  We would agree that this would have been
considered BACT 10 years ago if there was test data to validate the old
(pre-modification) and new (post-modification) emission rates to document
that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved.  Also
needed in the case-by-case review would be a representation of what the cost
of the controls would be with a discussion of why the  2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx
level could not be achieved.  This may be due to technical limitations such
as no additional controls or modifications are possible, or you may identify
cost in dollars per ton of NOx controlled to show that even though
additional modifications are available, the cost is prohibitive.

Re: Permitting Grandfathered Internal Combustion
  Engines and Turbines

Dear Ms. Romero:

As discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options for
grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines, we have agreed that
some of these facilities may qualify under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 or 82,
effective on December 1, 1972 and others may be permitted under 30 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 116, Subchapter H:  Voluntary Emission
Reduction Permits (VERP).  Specific questions raised are discussed below.

You have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an ""engine train
of less than 5,000 hp."" In your November 1, 2000 letter you gave two
examples of ""engine trains"" that you felt would meet Standard Exemption No.
6, ""Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine
trains of less than 5,000 hp total.""  We agree that several engines, each
less than 2000 hp, can be combined into a ""train"" providing compression to a
common header so long as the train does not exceed 5,000 hp, meet the
exemption requirements.  In cases where the total horsepower in a train
exceeds 5,000 hp, we will allow exemption of individual engines within such
a train provided that each engine is less than 2000 hp and the total
horsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed 5,000 hp.  In
the same standard exemption list, turbines were covered by Standard
Exemption No. 82, ""Gas turbines of less than 20,000 hp burning sweet natural
gas.""

The other major point of discussion has been the determination of ""10 year
old BACT"" required by 30 TAC o116.811(3)(A).  As we discussed, our review of
permitting 10 years ago reveals that very few, if any, old engines were
permitted; so no data is available to show what we would have required for
nitrogen oxides (NOX) best available control technology (BACT).  New engines
were permitted at 2 grams/horsepower-hour (g/hp-hr) of NOX for both rich
burn and lean burn engines.  At that time older rich burn engines could have
been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g/hp-hr limit
for NOX.  Lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both
2-stroke and 4-stroke versions are available, and no single method of
control is applicable.  The large number of different engine manufacturers,
and the availability of various models, makes it impossible to establish a
single 10 year old BACT level.  Some of the older engines may be capable of
being upgraded to meet a level of NOX of 5 to 8 g/hp-hr, the level
established in the 1992 revision of Standard Exemption No. 6, which also
established a 3 g/hp-hr standard for turbines.  While the standard exemption
does not establish BACT for upgrades it does recognize what is available.
Many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as high
as 25 to 29 g/hp-hr, so significant emission reductions may be achievable
even if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of 2 to 8
g/hp-hr.  The 10 year old BACT review on these engines and turbines will
have to be done on a case-by-case basis just as we would have done 10 years
ago.

We hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they
will be able to either exempt or permit under the VERP program and submit
their letters of intent to participate in the VERP program by December 7,
2000.

For engines and turbines that your members decide to propose for
authorization under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 and 82, please identify the
specific engines and turbines, identified by unit number, emission point
number (EPN), air quality account number, and plant name; and for each
account please submit a Form PI-7.  For each engine or turbine, please
submit a, Table 29 or 31 as applicable, and other technical information that
will support the standard exemption claim.

For engines that will be authorized by a VERP permit, please identify each
engine by unit number, EPN, air quality account number, and plant name, and
provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a
result of participation in the VERP program.  When the VERP applications are
submitted, information should be provided to show that NOX emissions will be
in the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr range.  If it is not possible to achieve this level of
emissions, please submit information that shows that it is not technically
feasible or economically reasonable to control NOX emissions to that level.
Information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved, even
when the targeted range of 2 to 8 g/hp-hr cannot be met, will be helpful in
staff review of the application.

We appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the VERP program a
success.  If you have any further questions, please contact Mr. James
Randall, P.E. at (512) 239-1078.

Subject: Grandfathered Facilities - Endangered Species With No
Prospects of Protection

The days of grandfathered facilities in Texas are numbered.  This does not
only mean those large facilities in nonattainment areas, but ANY facility
that was constructed prior to September, 1971 and has not subsequently been
rolled into some sort of new source review (NSR) permit or Permit by Rule
(formerly Standard Exemption).  Note that proposed new rules recently
published in the Texas Register for public comment will require operators to
be able to produce documentation of applicability and compliance for all
facilities authorized by a Permit by Rule/Standard Exemption, much the same
as is required for any other type of permit.

The TNRCC Sunset Bill contains language limiting the time that such
facilities may operate without NSR authorization of some sort.  The Senate
Committee Substitute (SCS) for HB 2912 is a little stricter than the version
passed by the House, but both versions did contain grandfathered facility
permitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version will
also.  If this version passes, you will have one additional year to apply
for a Voluntary Emissions Reduction Permit (VERP).  If your facility is a
pipeline facility, the TNRCC will require no more than a 30% reduction in
NOx, and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the same
area covered in one permit.

Note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly
Cindy Morphew of TxOGA and Celina Romero of ATINGP - that it looks as though
we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted
without having to use today's BACT.

This memo summarizes the SCS provisions for your information.  This is NOT
actual bill language - I've TRIED to make it easier to read.

Note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the House does not
concur in all of the changes made by the Senate and the bill goes to
Conference.  In addition, we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill on
the Senate floor to require shutdown on September 1, 2001 of grandfathered
facilities that do not have a pending permit application.  If that attempt
is successful, the opportunity to apply for a VERP will be gone on September
1.

The memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the current
opportunity to claim historical Permits by Rule (Standard Exemptions) as a
means of permitting a grandfathered facility.  I am not certain how long
this opportunity will continue to exist.  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE YOU
CAN.

In addition, I've appended some information on 10-year old BACT for
gas-fired IC engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to
get a VERP now.




PROVISIONS OF SCS FOR HB 2912 (PRIOR TO SENATE FLOOR DEBATE)

Sec. 382.05181.  PERMIT REQUIRED.

(a)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have an application pending
for a new source review permit or other authorization, other than a federal
operating permit, and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown as
provided in Section 382.05182 may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2003, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(b)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have a permit or other
authorization under this chapter, other than a federal operating permit
permit, may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2007, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(c)  Facilities eligible for a Small Business Stationary Source Permit are
subject to the permitting deadlines in Section 382.05184.

Sec. 382.05182.  NOTICE OF SHUTDOWN.

(a)  A notice of shutdown to allow operation of a grandfathered facility
beyond the deadlines of 382.05181(a) must be filed with the commission
before the applicable deadline.

(b)  A notice under this section shall include:

  (1)  the date the facility intends to cease operating;

  (2)  an inventory of the type and amount of emissions that
will be eliminated when the facility ceases to operate; and

  (3)  any other necessary and relevant information the
commission by rule deems appropriate.

GENERAL PROVISIONS (APPLICABLE TO PERMITS UNDER 382.05183, 382.05184, AND
382.05186)

(a)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that
there is no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene
the intent of this chapter, including protection of the public's health and
physical property.

(b)  If the commission finds that the emissions from the facility will not
comply with Subsection (c), the commission may not grant the permit under
this section.

(c)  A person planning the modification of a facility previously permitted
under this section must comply with new source permitting requirements
before modifying.

(d)  The commission may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer
this section.

(e)  If an applicant omits any relevant facts or submits incorrect
information in an application, the applicant shall submit the relevant facts
or correct the information no later than 60 days after discovering the
error.  If while processing the application, the commission determines that
additional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action on
the application, the commission may request the information and set a
reasonable deadline for a response.  Failure to comply with the deadline for
the response will result in the application being returned to the applicant.

Sec. 382.05183.  EXISTING FACILITY PERMIT.

(a)  The owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may apply for a
permit to operate the facility under this section.

(b)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that the
application:

  (1)  is filed before September 1, 2002 and the facility will
use an air pollution control method at least as effective as 10-year old
BACT; or

  (2)  is filed before the applicable deadline of 382.05181(a)
and the facility will use current BACT.

(c)  The commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for some
or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site.  Permits issued under this
subsection shall follow the same permit issuance, modification, and renewal
procedures as existing facility permits.

Sec. 382.05184.  SMALL BUSINESS STATIONARY SOURCE PERMIT.

(a)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source and are not required by commission rule to submit an
annual emissions inventory report may apply for a permit under this section
before September 1, 2005.

(b)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source that does not have an application pending for a new source
review permit or other authorization, other than a federal operating permit,
and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown, may not emit air
contaminants on or after September 1, 2007.

Sec.  382.05185.  ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITY PERMIT.

Special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generating
facilities are not outlined in this memo.

Sec. 382.05186.  AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE FACILITIES.

(a)  The commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applications
for grandfathered processing, treating, compression, or pumping facilities
connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(b)  Based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local,
regional, and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly to
federal air quality standards, the commission may require up to a 30%
reduction of the hourly emission rates of NOx and VOC from reciprocating
internal combustion engines subject to this section.  For facilities other
than reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or part
of a gathering or transmission pipeline , the commission may consider
requiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to 30% for NOx and 20% for
VOC.  The commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state
where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than
in other areas, but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate
may be required in any area.

(c)  The commission shall:

  (1)  allow for a single permit for all facilities connected
to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline;

  (2)  allow for required reductions for facilities under this
section to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than one
facility and located in the same local, regional, or statewide areas
designated by the commission under Subsection (b);

  (3)  for purposes of emission averaging, allow emission
reductions achieved from grandfathered since September 1, 1997; and

  (4)  allow an owner or operator to apply for separate
permits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected to
or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(d)  Facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permitted
under this chapter.




CURRENT OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM A PERMIT BY RULE TO ""PERMIT"" A GRANDFATHERED
FACILITY

TNRCC has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfathered
facilities using any applicable ""Permit by Rule,"" including those previously
referred to as Standard Exemptions.

For instance, old Standard Exemption 7, effective May 8, 1972, was for ""Gas
fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine trains of
less than 5000 hp total"" and can be used to permit any such engine(s).  For
clarification on this particular exemption, the language used by staff in
proposing this exemption to the Texas Air Control Board in 1972 was as
follows:  ""Engines smaller than 2000 hp are quite numerous and are not
considered a substantial source unless joined together IN SERIES (emphasis
added) to form an engine train.  Engine trains of less than 5000 hp are not
considered a substantial source.  Because control technology for NOx
emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited, it
is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit
system at this time.""  (""Exemptions From Permits Procedures and
Justification for Exemptions,"" <signed> Charles R. Barden, P.E., Executive
Secretary, Texas Air Control Board, May 8, 1972.)

A list of the ""Historical Standard Exemptions"" is available on the TNRCC
Website at http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html
<http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html> .  In
applying these ""Permits by Rule,"" be sure to check the corresponding
""Exemption Preambles"" (if any) for any applicable General Conditions.

TNRCC has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilities
by PI-8 AND a simple notification cover letter to them so that they will
have a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longer
considered to be grandfathered.  The registration will buy you a letter of
acknowledgement that you have claimed the ""permit by rule"" (don't use the
term ""exemption"" in any correspondence) for these engines.

Subject: Response to 11/21/00 Teleconference 001204

I believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the TRNCC
will provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for 10-year BACT
for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.  The
last piece of information is an email that I am forwarding to you with this
email.  It is an email from John Steib to which he attaches an email from
Jim Linville.  In response to a request from us, Jim Linville sets forth in
his email an example of a large engine with emissions in the 29 gram per
horsepower hour range that cannot reduce emissions to the 2-8 gram level and
what the owner/operator of that engine must demonstrate in order to obtain a
VERP permit.
Remember, that in order to be included in the TNRCC's January 15, 2001
report to the legislature, a letter of intent or application for a VERP
should be filed with the TNRCC on or before next Thursday, December 7, 2000.
To summarize, we have obtained the following policies from the TNRCC:
1. Grandfathered internal combustion engines of less than 2000
horsepower can be authorized by Standard Exemption No. 6 effective December
1, 1972, regardless of the level of emissions from those facilities. (See my
letter to Kerry Drake dated September 15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me
dated October 3, 2000).
2. Grandfathered engine trains of less than 5000 horsepower, or a
portion of an engine train up to 5000 horsepower may be authorized under
Standard Exemption No. 6, December 1, 1972, so long as each engine in the
train does not exceed 2000 horsepower.  (See my letter to James Randall
dated November 1, 2000 and Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
3. Grandfathered turbines of less than 20,000 horsepower may be
authorized by Standard Exemption No. 82, dated December 1, 1972 regardless
of the level of emissions.  (See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September
15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me dated October 3, 2000).
4. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled to
the 2-8 gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review.
(See James Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
5. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to be
controlled to the 2-8 gram range may be permittable under a VERP if there is
test data to validate the old (pre-modification) and new (post-modification)
emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions
would be achieved.  Also needed would be a representation of the cost of the
controls and even though additional modifications are available, the
additional cost is prohibitive. (See Jim Randall's letter to me dated
November 16, 2000 and the email attached hereto).

I hope all of this is helpful.  I have forwarded to you copies of the
referenced letters by fax on earlier dates.  If you need another copy please
let me know.

Celina and James,

During our teleconference today, you asked for an example of what we would
consider ""significant emission reductions"" that would be acceptable in a
case-by-case review when the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level could not be achieved.
A large 2-stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately 29 g/hp-hr
of NOx would be considered to have significant emissions reductions if
actual emissions are reduced by 50 percent even though it does not meet the
2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level.  We would agree that this would have been
considered BACT 10 years ago if there was test data to validate the old
(pre-modification) and new (post-modification) emission rates to document
that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved.  Also
needed in the case-by-case review would be a representation of what the cost
of the controls would be with a discussion of why the  2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx
level could not be achieved.  This may be due to technical limitations such
as no additional controls or modifications are possible, or you may identify
cost in dollars per ton of NOx controlled to show that even though
additional modifications are available, the cost is prohibitive.

I received by fax late yesterday evening, a letter signed by John Steib re
10-yr BACT guidelines for engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.
After my first read, it looks pretty good.  Look for a copy of it by fax.

Re: Permitting Grandfathered Internal Combustion
  Engines and Turbines

Dear Ms. Romero:

As discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options for
grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines, we have agreed that
some of these facilities may qualify under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 or 82,
effective on December 1, 1972 and others may be permitted under 30 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 116, Subchapter H:  Voluntary Emission
Reduction Permits (VERP).  Specific questions raised are discussed below.

You have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an ""engine train
of less than 5,000 hp."" In your November 1, 2000 letter you gave two
examples of ""engine trains"" that you felt would meet Standard Exemption No.
6, ""Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine
trains of less than 5,000 hp total.""  We agree that several engines, each
less than 2000 hp, can be combined into a ""train"" providing compression to a
common header so long as the train does not exceed 5,000 hp, meet the
exemption requirements.  In cases where the total horsepower in a train
exceeds 5,000 hp, we will allow exemption of individual engines within such
a train provided that each engine is less than 2000 hp and the total
horsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed 5,000 hp.  In
the same standard exemption list, turbines were covered by Standard
Exemption No. 82, ""Gas turbines of less than 20,000 hp burning sweet natural
gas.""

The other major point of discussion has been the determination of ""10 year
old BACT"" required by 30 TAC o116.811(3)(A).  As we discussed, our review of
permitting 10 years ago reveals that very few, if any, old engines were
permitted; so no data is available to show what we would have required for
nitrogen oxides (NOX) best available control technology (BACT).  New engines
were permitted at 2 grams/horsepower-hour (g/hp-hr) of NOX for both rich
burn and lean burn engines.  At that time older rich burn engines could have
been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g/hp-hr limit
for NOX.  Lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both
2-stroke and 4-stroke versions are available, and no single method of
control is applicable.  The large number of different engine manufacturers,
and the availability of various models, makes it impossible to establish a
single 10 year old BACT level.  Some of the older engines may be capable of
being upgraded to meet a level of NOX of 5 to 8 g/hp-hr, the level
established in the 1992 revision of Standard Exemption No. 6, which also
established a 3 g/hp-hr standard for turbines.  While the standard exemption
does not establish BACT for upgrades it does recognize what is available.
Many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as high
as 25 to 29 g/hp-hr, so significant emission reductions may be achievable
even if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of 2 to 8
g/hp-hr.  The 10 year old BACT review on these engines and turbines will
have to be done on a case-by-case basis just as we would have done 10 years
ago.

We hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they
will be able to either exempt or permit under the VERP program and submit
their letters of intent to participate in the VERP program by December 7,
2000.

For engines and turbines that your members decide to propose for
authorization under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 and 82, please identify the
specific engines and turbines, identified by unit number, emission point
number (EPN), air quality account number, and plant name; and for each
account please submit a Form PI-7.  For each engine or turbine, please
submit a, Table 29 or 31 as applicable, and other technical information that
will support the standard exemption claim.

For engines that will be authorized by a VERP permit, please identify each
engine by unit number, EPN, air quality account number, and plant name, and
provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a
result of participation in the VERP program.  When the VERP applications are
submitted, information should be provided to show that NOX emissions will be
in the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr range.  If it is not possible to achieve this level of
emissions, please submit information that shows that it is not technically
feasible or economically reasonable to control NOX emissions to that level.
Information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved, even
when the targeted range of 2 to 8 g/hp-hr cannot be met, will be helpful in
staff review of the application.

We appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the VERP program a
success.  If you have any further questions, please contact Mr. James
Randall, P.E. at (512) 239-1078.

data and predictions ie., like how much solvent do we really need to clean 
the pipeline and the injection intervals and locations, but not whether the 
solvent or technology would or would not work.  The data did show that  
terpenoline does remove PCB's from pipeline.  But because Penn State was so 
deeply involved in the modeling study, and we were still under the PG&E 
thumb, it appeared to be in the best interest of TW to see it to the end.   
There wasnt anyone who had any better suggestions or ideas.  The thought was 
that because of the amount of $$$$$$ we had previously spent, not to see it 
through would have meant 0 return  for the money we had invested.    And if 
it works, the money would have been wisely used. 

The real truth of course is when we do a trial run.  I signed a six month 
extension to the contract for Penn State (I sent out a memo on this) but not 
for additional $$$$$$.  They needed the extra time to complete the modeling 
study and data evaluation.  Last summer/fall, Tiny had been overseeing the 
operational side of this (ie terpenoline storage locations and coordinating 
injection points and the pigging activities).  When the decision is made to 
begin the injections and pigging, Tiny will be ready  and waiting......

$375 per kit.? UPSCO is the service firm in New York state that asked Dow to 
reformulate an insulation polyurethane foam product that they marketed.? The 
new product had a pressure of up to 260 psi and a retarded set time.? Both 
factors allowed better fill of pipe being abandoned.? Dow and UPSCO seem to 
have partnered on this product.

In addition, here is the MSDS for the product.? The exposure of employees is 
negligible, however, since there are tight fitting connections to the pipe 
being filled.

Subject: Comments to UPSCO Inc. 

Dan, I have copied your questions and have responded in capital letters.? 
Please realize that this is my reaction as of today, and that may change as 
we gain experience with the Froth Paks.

Did we meet your expectations?? 

YES.? YOU MET MY EXPECTATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR PRODUCT.? MY 
EXPECTATIONS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE POSITIVE DEMONSTRATION THAT I OBSERVED IN 
ALBANY.? WHAT I WANTED TO ASSESS WAS ACTUAL USE IN THE FIELD, THE NECESSITY 
TO HAVE A TIGHT FITTING CONNECTION TO THE SERVICE AND WHETHER THAT WAS A 
SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO USING THIS PRODUCT, THE TIME REQUIRED TO SET UP, AND 
THE OVERALL REACTION OF OPERATING MANAGEMENT AND FIELD CREWS.? THE REACTION 
TO THE PRODUCT WAS VERY POSITIVE.

Do we have any challenges that need to be addressed?? 

1.????? COST IS A BIG ONE.? IF WE CAN FILL 10 SERVICES (I BELIEVE THAT THIS 
WAS JOHN CAHILL'S GUESS FOR 50 FOOT SERVICES) PER FROTH PAK AT A COST OF 
$375, THAT HAS A UNIT ABANDONMENT COST OF $37.50 COMPARED WITH THE $5 WE ARE 
SPENDING FOR AN AEROSOL CAN.? CLEARLY THE FROTH PAK FILLS THE SERVICES OVER 
LONGER DISTANCES, CONSISTENTLY, RAPIDLY, AND MORE RELIABLY.? AS JOHN CAHILL 
AND I DISCUSSED, INCREASED SALES WILL BRING THE COST DOWN.? 

??????? -- IT MAY BE PREMATURE, BUT WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE OF HOW COST MAY 
VARY WITH INCREASED DEMAND?? 
??????? -- HOW MANY UNITS DO YOU HAVE TO SELL TO TRIGGER A SIGNIFICANT 
REDUCTION IS PRICE?? 
??????? -- THERE WAS AN INDICATION THAT PALLETS OF 30 WOULD HAVE A QUANTITY 
DISCOUNT, BUT WHAT IS THAT DISCOUNTED PRICE OF A PALLET?

THERE MAY BE A MIDDLE GROUND FOR US OF USING CANS FOR CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES 
AND THE FROTH PAK FOR OTHERS.? 

THE TWO PAKS THAT WERE LEFT FOR OUR USE WILL PROVIDE US SOME USEFUL HANDS-ON 
EVALUATION OPPORTUNITIES. 

2.????? SHELF-LIFE AFTER THE CYLINDERS ARE OPENED.? THE 45-DAY LIFE MAY NOT 
ALLOW US TO EFFICIENTLY USE UP REAGENTS.? WE ARE A LARGE TERRITORY COMPANY.? 
SHARING OF PAKS BETWEEN DISTRICTS WOULD MEAN TRAVEL TIME TO TAKE KITS FROM 
DISTRICT TO DISTRICT.? ON THE OTHER HAND, INDIVIDUAL PAKS FOR EACH DISTRICT 
MAY MEAN GREATER WASTED REAGENTS.

Where do we go from here?? 

FOR OUR COMPANY, THE FIRST STEP IS TO DEVELOP A SURVEY FORM THAT WE WILL USE 
FOR THE CREWS.? (THE DRAFT FORM IS UNDER REVIEW.)? WE WILL BE ABLE TO TALLY 
SUCCESSES UNDER VARYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE REACTION OF THE FIELD CREWS, AS 
WELL AS IDENTIFYING ANY PROBLEM SITUATIONS.? WE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP 
THE AVERAGE COST PER SERVICE.? THE TWO KITS WILL BE USED IN TWO DIFFERENT 
REGIONS, AND THE INFORMATION/EXPERIENCE WILL BE EXAMINED TO SEE IF THERE WERE 
ANY PROBLEMS.? COSTS WILL BE CALCULATED.? THEN WE WILL DECIDE WHETHER WE NEED 
TO PILOT THIS SOME MORE, OR WE WOULD PREFER TO STAY WITH OUR PRESENT METHODS, 
OR IF WE WISH TO IMPLEMENT USE OF YOUR PRODUCT FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS.

JOHN CAHILL WILL BE PROVIDING US INFORMATION REGARDING LANDFILLING APPROVAL 
FOR PRODUCT FOAM AND DEPLETED REAGENT PRESSURE CONTAINERS.? 

ANDY BOOS WILL BE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL NOZZLE/CONNECTORS TO CAREY DOWNS, 
BECAUSE OF THE SHORTER AVERAGE LENGTH ABANDONMENTS IN HIS REGION.

One of the thoughts that we are currently evaluating and would greatly 
appreciate your input on is the following:? Based upon all of our field work 
we believe that it may be advantageous to under fill the cylinders of 
chemical (180 board feet to 110-120) and in turn increase the amount of 
propellant from 250 psi to 350 psi.? In our opinion this would serve three 
functions: 1) Reduce potential material waste; 2) Reduce any potential 
confusion associated with using a 

kit multiple times; 3) Reduce the cost per foot factors and the acquisition 
price.? What do you think? 

1.????? THIS APPROACH WOULD ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS ABOUT WASTED REAGENT.? 
2.????? FOR USING THE KIT AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS, THERE IS PROBABLY A NEED TO 
TRACK HOW MANY ABANDONMENTS OF WHAT DIAMETER AND LENGTH IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE 
HOW MANY ADDITIONAL LINES YOU CAN FILL.? TOWARD THE END OF A KIT, THERE IS A 
QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO FILL A LINE OR NOT.? CAN YOU SWITCH 
PAKS WHEN ONE RUNS OUT, IF YOU DO IT WITHIN 2 MINUTES OF THE INJECTION START 
TIME OF THE FIRST KIT?? OTHERWISE THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH RUNNING OUT OF 
REACTANTS WHEN YOU'VE SQUIRTED IN LESS THAN ENOUGH FOR 50% OF THE VOLUME.? 
THERE IS ALSO A PROBLEM WITH DECIDING WHAT PERCENTAGE YOU HAVE FILLED WHEN 
YOU RUN OUT.

3.????? IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE COST PER FOOT WOULD GO UP WITH UNDERFILLED 
CYLINDERS, SINCE THE FIXED COST IS THE SAME FOR CYLINDERS, HOSES, TRIGGER, 
AND CARDBOARD BOX.? YOU WOULD STILL GET THE SAME NUMBER OF BOXES ON A PALLET, 
BUT YOU'D FILL FEWER LINES WITH THAT PALLET.

FEWER FILLS AND CHEAPER PAKS WOULD, HOWEVER, ALLOW US TO PURCHASE MORE AND 
DISTRIBUTE THEM MORE WIDELY.? THAT WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE TRAVEL TIME TO 
DELIVER SHARED PAKS.

I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT THE FEEDBACK IS FROM THE OPERATING REGIONS AFTER 
THEY PILOT THE PAKS BEFORE WE GIVE YOU OUR MEASURED OPINION ON THE UNDERFILL 
CONCEPT.

THAT'S ALL OF MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT REACTION FOR NOW.? THANKS FOR THE 
EVALUATION OPPORTUNITY.

Subject:  Mewborne - Quercho Bone Springs Unit - Sec 23-18S-32E

Wade - As you're probably aware of by now, on April 2nd, Carl Eby with
Phillips called inquiring about a possible tie-in of the subject unit to
our ""Young Deep"" pipeline system we acquired from Koch.  A question arose
as to whether or not a west to east spur existed off the north/south
mainline which would be near the unit.  It was initially conveyed to me
that ETS would take a backhoe out to the mainline to make this
determination.  I have since learned that this has been delayed due to the
need for an ""environmental matrix"", whatever that may be.  The roads to
this unit are in extremely poor condition, and the operator would like to
pipeline connect if possible.  Production is represented at 300 bpd.

A couple of issues:

1)  Could someone explain to me the process involved in an ""env. matrix"",
and why it take 2 months to determine if we have a pipeline in the ground?
Is someone with ETS in Houston delaying this, if so, who is the responsible
party?
2)  Tariff on this system (NMSCC #17) is 50 cents/bbl at this time, plus
PLA.  From the maps I have, it appears this system consists of around 10 to
12 miles of gathering and mainline.  Current production on the system is
around 115 bpd of WTI, or $23,000/yr monetized.  The pipe in the ground is
fairly new from what I've been told by my contact at Koch.  If we can
manage to tie this well in, revenue would be raised an additional
$60,000/year at current tariff rates.  What costs are currently associated
with this system?  A decision needs to be made on the economic feasibility
of keeping it operable given the current tariff rates and current/proposed
throughput, or the rates needed to keep the system viable.

Bottom line, Phillips and the producer need an answer, one way or the
other, so they can get on with the business of safely transporting this
crude oil.  EOTT Pipeline needs an answer, one way or the other, so we can
decide how to best manage this system.

Any assistance in moving this forward and allowing EOTT to maintain some
image of credibility would be appreciated.  I would also like to pass along
my appreciation of Rick Cribbs and the information he has been able to
provide thusfar.

Subject: PG&E

The following is the update I received from the Kingman Team on todays 
pigging activities:

Tiny,
 We kicked two pigs today with 55 gals of diesel in front of each pig.  On 
the first run we got only enough liquid to get a sample.  The pig came out 
with a big chunk out of it.  Don't know what is causing this because we have 
received a couple of pigs that were damaged.  This is only the second pig 
that has come in that we cannot use again.   
 When the second pig came in, we received 41 gals of liquid.  We had to haul 
it out a pail at a time.  We pulled about half from the seperator and half 
from the drain tap in front of the seperator.
 These two runs took us nine hours to run, that is why we only did two.  We 
plan on putting in 100 gals of diesel tomarrow since they are going to ship 
some more diesel for us on Monday.  If flow rate permitting we plan on 
kicking two more pigs tomarrow with 100 gals each.

Brent  & Russ

Per this evenings discussions with Gas Control, it looks like we will have 60 
mmcfd scheduled to PG&E for tomorrows (Sundays) gas day.  Gas Control will 
make every effort to coordinate flows with PG&E and insure we have higher 
flowing volumes during the pigging hours if at all possible.  Again the new 
pigs are due to be on site by Tuesday.   I forwarded an e:mail message to 
Kingman informing them to insure they split a sample with PG&E on the 15 MP 
sample point.  

I've set up a conf. call for this Friday the 13th at 10:00 am Houston time.  
We should have additional sampling infromation by this time not only from the 
Weekly Report but on the pigging activites as well.  (877-795-3687   pin

Subject: PG&E


Hope you had a better flight home than me - late one hour departing, flew to 
Omaha and circled because of lightning and thunderstorms until we had to go 
to Kansas City for fuel, then back to Omaha to sneak in between lightning 
bolts - the drive home was a combination of being blinded by lightning, 
unable to see because of driving rain, or praying the car could make it 
through the flooded streets! Anyway, home by 1:15 AM, so not too bad.

Here's what I believe to be our current plan, which will be communicated to 
PG&E through letter to Rod Boschee.

1.  Continue to inject diesel at a 55 gal rate and pig daily through 8/15
We will be running from 2 to 4 pigs daily (depending on flow rates) and 
injecting 100 gallon per pig run.  Today (Saturday) was the exception because 
of flow rates and the volume of diesel on hand (400 gn's).  Two pigs were run 
at 55 gallons of diesel per pig.  This 400 gallons under the previous pigging 
schedule would have lasted for 1 1/2 weeks at the single pig per day & at 55 
gallons per pig.  A load of diesel will be on location Monday.   

2.  Collect liquids from all pig runs for analysis and trending (daily or as 
often as pigs are received)

3.  Collect liquids from TW's filter / separator for analysis and trending 
(daily)
This is above and beyond the weekly accumulation and split sampling at this 
point.  The Weekly Split sampling will still continue.  

4.  After 8/15, continue pigging daily w/o injection of any liquids to dry 
pipe through 9/7

5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above

6. Schedule Vector to be on site September 7 to decontaminate a.) 1850' of 
pipe from TW's measurement to PG&E's filter/separator and b.)  PG&E's 
filter/separator.  
Larry/Earl - We're still OK on clearances for ROW and excavation etc... 
should we need to make a cut into the 1850' of pipe aren't we?  I'm assuming 
the clearances we received for the siphon project would carry forward????

7. Post 5 day outage for scheduled pipeline maintenance on EBB as soon as 
Vector confirms date.

8. Trending and analysis will determine if any pigging or further decon work 
will be done on TW's upstream pipe.

Please review, add, subtract, correct, etc. prior to Monday. Thanks for 
continuing help - this is going to be a very tough win, if a win is possible.

44375,campbell-l/all_documents/410.,<10381884.1075851887636.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"After reveiwing the documents entitled, ""Baseline Environmental Investigation 
of Arco North Coles Levee Plant 8, Rogas Loading Facility and Associated 
Natural Gas Pipeline Systems Kern County, California"" and ""Report of 
Preliminary Asessment Sampling North Coles Levee Gas Plant Loading Rack Area 
Tupman, California"", it appears that the following areas should be 
investigated further to detemine horizontal and vertical extent of  
identified contamination from the above referenced reports:

 Tank 15 area-  total petroleum hydrocarbons

 Glycol reboiler area- total petroleum hydrocarbons

 Hot oil heater area- total petroleum hydrocarbons

   Wash rack area- lead

 Propane comp. area lead  
    total petroleum hydrocarbons
    chromates

 Cooling tower area- chromates

 Compressor area- BTEX
    chromates
    lead

In the ""Baseline Environmental Investigation"" report, sampling was only 
conducted to an approximate depth of 2.5'.  I am not comfortable with basing 
decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth, in leau of the 
fact that  many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move 
vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas.  This 
is indeed the case for chromates.  I based my recommendations for metal 
concentrations on the federal RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste target levels 
for metals and evaluated  the TPH and BTEX levels with the  underground 
storage tank guidlines for California.  There were references to a 1989 
document in the ""Baseline"" report for specific parameters, but there may have 
been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and 
therefore, I used 10,000 ppm which is a general action level for most states 
for total petroleum hydrocarbons.  Again, I did not evaluate the mercury or 
the loading rack issues.

fact that  many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move 
vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas.  This 
is indeed the case for chromates.  I based my recommendations for metal

be $5000 per month and rental on two units would be $4000-$4500 per unit per 
month. I also contacted Baker Furnace regarding rental of comparable SVE 
equipment and they indicated that rental would be $3000 per month. In light 
of this, I suggest we establish a rental rate for the TW units, as is, at 
$2500 per unit per month. 

I also discussed costs associated with refurbishing old units with John Sachs 
at Baker Furnace. John indicated that they have already replaced the old 
Baker Fax telemetry systems with Sensaphone 2000 systems on several used 
units. He also indicated the various options they have for silencing the 
units. It can be done, but apparently, adding silencers to the blower is not 
a simple modification.

We are set up to move the units to Midland next week, but I think we should 
strongly consider shipping the units back to Baker Furnace for these 
modifications. John indicated that they could turn them around in about two 
weeks. Allowing for shipping time, this would place the units back in Midland 
around June 20th (a more realistic date would be June 30th). A rough cost 
estimate is $18000 ($7000 per unit plus $4000 shipping). I believe this would 
save both time and cost compared to trying to do the modifications in 
Midland. We would also end up with ""good as new"" units. As a compromise

sent to the Governor and will likely be signed. I am providing a quick 
summary of this bill since you may be discussing it next week in Houston. I 
will be attending a TXOGA pipeline committee meeting on June 5 where it will 
be discussed in detail, and will provide more information after that meeting.

The Bill divides the state into two regions. East Texas is all counties east 
of I-35 (north of San Antonio) and north of I-37 (south of San Antonio) that 
transverse these highways. This region includes Nueces County. West Texas is 
the rest of the state.

In East Texas, you must apply for a permit for grandfathered emission sources 
by September 1, 2003 and comply with the permit by March 1, 2007. In West 
Texas you must apply by September 1, 2004 and comply with the permit by March 
1, 2008. The control requirements in the permit, except for pipeline 
reciprocating engines, will be based on 10-year old BACT.

There are specific provisions for pipeline reciprocating engines. In East 
Texas, 50% reductions of NOx and VOC will be required. In West Texas, 0% to 
20% reductions of NOx and VOC will be required. You will have the flexibility 
to attain these reductions on a per engine basis or can average over multiple 
engines. A $16.2 million fund has been established by Reliant to partially 
finance the cost of compliance with the pipeline engine requirements in East 
Texas.

As you are aware, the cost impact of this legislation can be greatly reduced 
by ""authorizing"" as many grandfathered emission sources as possible under old 
standard exemptions as per the October 3, 2000 letter from TNRCC. Most 
grandfathered engines, tanks, dehys etc. can be authorized via old 
exemptions. Previously TNRCC indicated verbally that this method of 
authorizing grandfathered sources would be available until September 1, 2001,

Provided annual SPCC training to the Mountainair team for 2001.   

A meeting was held with the New Mexico Regional Director of the Rocky 
Mountain Elk Foundation.  A presentation was given to the Foundation 
proposing an excelr Partnership with them.   The Foundation was very agreeable 
and is looking forward to Transwestern's participation in their program.  A 
meeting has been scheduled with the Arizona Chapter of the RMEF to discuss 
opportunities for the Transwestern employees volunteer efforts in assisting 
the Arizona Chpater.  An internal presentation will be given at the ETS Cross 
Functional Meeting in Albuquerque in June  to the ETS employees apprising 
them of opportunities for which they can participate in to assist the 
foundation.

NSPS emissions testing was completed  for the ""like for like""  turbine power 
turbine replacement at the La Plata C/S in Colorado.  The ;unit sucessfully 
passed the emissions standards for NSPS.

All environmental clearances have been received for the Red Rock Mainline 
Expansion.  The only outstanding environmental issues are the air permits for 
the four C/S.  A ruling has been made  by EPA Region IX and the State of 
Arizona that the applications were ruled complete.  The permits are expected 
to be issued in September of this year.  

Emissions inventories were completed and submitted to the State of Arizona 
for C/S's 1, 2 and the Flagstaff Lateral.

Standard exemptions under the VERP program were submitted to the TNRCC for 
the following major source facilites:  Wt-2, Walton, Spraberry and Eldorado

 We are currently completing the improved modeling to include the
effect of flow regimes, which I am sure that you recall that in our meeting
the last time, we agreed that this will be a major influence on both the
quantity of solvent and time required to clean it up. It is probably the
most important modification to the model. It has been a major efforts. We
hope to complete this part by June 20th. Then we will perform the rigorous
model testing.  With the continuous testing we have done on every module
independently, I do not expect us to run into any major difficulty, hence I
expect that to be done in one week to 10 days. We will then begin to conduct
parametric runs for the TW system. We will analyze the results and come up
with a summary of what it means and how that will affect economics, etc. So,
with all these, I will be able to prepare a comprehensive progress report by
July 15th. I hope that this schedule meets your approval.
 The flow regime & time-of-contact work is something that we did not
anticipate originally but which came up in the course of the review that
you, John and Tiny had with us at Penn State. I believe that it is really
important as some of the initial results are showing. So, I am grateful for
your input. It has taken a little more time (perhaps more than little) to do
it but we are very very close to completing this part. I believe that it
would be worth the effort.
 I have been told by the Office of Research that our current contract
expires at the end of the month unless you sign the ""no-cost"" extension.
This document should have reached your desk according to them. I am not sure
that you'd recall; we have been able to conserve funds on the project
because I have 2 of the students (they are from Venezuela) working on the
project being sponsored by their own Govt. and hence we have not paid them
from the project. I would appreciate your prompt approval of the no-cost
extension of the contract so that the University would not stop us from
continuing. When I submit my comprehensive progress report in mid-July, I
suggest that we meet thereafter to discuss the results and direction and at
that point, it would be necessary to discuss the finance as well.
 I appreciate the support that I have received from all of you. I
look forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,
Michael

Hi Larry:
     Sorry for the delayed response. I have just got back from an
overseas trip yesterday. I am in the process of preparing a progress report
for you. We have obtained some additional interesting results. I was also
waiting for input from your group. You may recall that at the end of our
Houston meeting, John told me that he would be getting back to me on some
specific directions from the group. I believe that we would be done with
the
major aspects of PCB work soon, then we would be focusing on arsenic.
Please
let me know of any thoughts and ideas. Thanks Larry.
     We are finally seeing the Spring here and maybe a short one for that
matter. Summer is just around the corner.
Best Regards,
Michael

Larry,

I received this email message from Leslie this afternoon... she asked if I
had received the letter from her that approved TW's request to discontinue
the groundwater monitoring at the Puckett site.

She may have asked this because she may have expected to receive an annual
report last week.

Last week, I sent to you a draft of what I thought should go into the new
annual reports, now that we don't have any groundwater monitoring to report.

Please let me know if you want me to send an annual report to her.

legislation was discussed in detail. The following information is in addition 
to the previous message on this legislation:

Several members could not agree on whether the option being offered by TNRCC 
of using old standard exemptions to ""authorize"" grandfathered emission 
sources would be pulled off the table on September 1, 2001. The general 
consensus is that companies should complete the process of using the old 
exemptions by September 1 in case TNRCC does not allow this option anymore;

Although the legislation allows 0 to 20% reductions on pipeline engines in 
West Texas, TNRCC has indicated that they will not require reductions in West 
Texas, except for ""huge emitters"". No one knows what they mean by huge 
emitters;

TNRCC is required to reduce compressor engine NOx emissions by 50% in East 
Texas, but MAY require 50% VOC reductions in East Texas. No one has heard 
whether TNRCC will require VOC reductions. VOC reductions on a 2-cycle 
engine, especially on a Cooper engine with good combustion characteristics, 
could be problematic;

The TXOGA Pipeline committee will take the lead on responding to the 
regulations that are developed due to this legislation. I will certainly 
participate in this process.

Larry  - Sorry for the delay, but with PRC, life in HR has been pretty
intense.  I also made some initial contacts with the RMEF and have only
managed to play phone tag with the people I really needed to talk to.
Sounds like you've had better luck.

My approach was to look at a way to partner with the RMEF with their land
and habitat conservation programs on a national level rather than focusing
on any particular state.  Hopefully this would encourage broad based excelr
employee support and not foster any state biased partisanship.

Contamination -- HC and HG -- Letter to Koch





     Hell, I don't even talk like that:  I just tend to get pedantic in my
demand letters to Koch.  Obviously it's ok to leave that out -- doesn't
change the import of the letter.

     It has occurred to me that, since the time I drafted it, the signature
block might best say something like ""Larry Campbell of ETS on behalf of
EOTT"" or words to that effect.  Do you guys do that sort of thing?  Again,
I don't think it's essential, but maybe it's a nice touch to make clear
that this is a request by EOTT through ETS.  What do you think?  Thanks.

Gary Fuller deal directly with Van Ryn allowed us to better move the ball

   I thought we agreed that Larry was going to send the letter I drafted to

 My further research into the California requirements shows that we have 
reporting and notification requirements for the other contaminations, but not 
the obligation necessarily to dig further.  I think it might be helpful to 
have another phone call to discuss what the action plan should be.  Maybe we 
should do that?  Please let me know.  Thanks. --ETA

Subject: NCL -- Soil Contamination Issues

 Just to follow up, did you send a letter to Van Ryn at Koch re the 
hydrocarbon and mercury contaminations?  If so, could you please send me a 
copy?

 Also, have you been able to come up with any further info on what to do 
about the other soil contamination areas?  Do you still want to determine the 
full lateral and vertical extent of all?  FYI, I have made further inquiry as 
to whether we have any reporting or investigatory duties based upon the 
levels in the WZI report.  I believe the numbers you cited in you 5/21 email 
may be only part of the story: as you have appropriately noted, in California 
it is not only concentration levels that matter; rather, other variables such 
as depth to groundwater, proximity to population centers, etc. determine 
whether any reporting or remedial (including further investigatory) 
obligations arise.  Therefore, I'm checking further to see how these other 
variable impact our legal obligations here.  (Again, I think this is very 
important inour case because we want to be careful about potenially 
jeopardizing our indemnity rights against Koch by performing any Phase 
II-type activities where not legally required.

 I expect to have more info on this by the end of the week.  Perhaps we can 
chat then?  Thanks. --ETA

I just spoke with Mr. Charles de Saillan, Asst. General Counsel for the NMED, 
concerning the referenced Compliance Order.  Apparently the NMED mailed out 
60 of these orders last week.  The NM legislature has adopted a statute of 
limitations under the NM Air Quality Act and the NMED was acting to attempt 
to foreclose the use of this defense.  (Dave - can Mary hunt this new 
legislation down??).

The language in the order assessing a $15,000 penalty per day of violation is 
standard language when the NMED has not assessed a specific figure.  It will 
be a couple of weeks before the NMED will be able to provide us a specific 
penalty.  We discussed settlement and the administrative hearing process.  A 
settlement meeting is not likely to take place soon due to the NMED's 
workload.  We need to have a number from the NMED before the settlement 
conference anyway. We will have to file the request to go to hearing no later 
tahn July 18th.  However, Charlie stated that if the respondent evidenced 
good faith to achieve as settlement the Secretary had the discretion to allow 
additional time to submit a full answer (where we provided all of the details 
of our defense.)

I told Charlie we would be organizing ourselves internally and that we would 
get back to him with some proposed dates for a settlement conference, a 
request for hearing and a request to extend the time in which to file an 
answer - preferably tied to after the settlement conference.

Let's see about dates and Dave or I will call the NMED and submit a letter 
with the three items above.  We want to make sure that the NMED has time 
before the end of the 30 day period to respond to our request for an

This is to let you know where we are on your proposed settlement agreement.
TEPI's SH&E staff advises me that  the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division
(""OCD"") has required revisions to TEPI's remediation plan for this site.  We
are reluctant to submit to you a revised draft of the settlement agreement
until that remediation plan is finalized with the OCD in about October. At
that time we will get excelr a redraft.

I have reviewed your last draft and have a few conceptual items I would like
to mention to you , bearing in mind that I have not participated in earlier
discussions or drafts:

(1) I notice that the proposed agreement requires TEPI to remediate the site
and to reimburse Northern for all out of pocket expenses for investigation,
assessment ,remediation and monitoring  this site, if TEPI is the source of
contamination--- but that Northern is only required to reimburse TEPI for
its part of the environmental assessment if Northern is found to be the
source. I would think that these provisions should be bilateral and that the
settlement agreement should also provide that if Northern is at fault, it
would remediate the site, as well as reimburse TEPI for all of the same out
of pocket  expenses.

(2) How does excelr/Northern feel about submitting this dispute to binding
AAA arbitration in Houston,  if the parties cannot agree on the source of
the contamination after TEPI conducts the environmental assessment, with the
arbitrators empowered to allocate costs if they determine that both parties
contributed to the contamination?  If arbitration is agreeable, I will
prepare an arbitration provision for our next draft.

(3) I am inclined to have the agreement interpreted under Texas law, rather
than New Mexico's,  since both companies have large presences in Texas , but
do not feel strongly about it.

Let me know your thoughts on these matters when you have a chance.

** Proprietary **

Lou,

I received you phone message and fax.  I tried to reach Larry Campbell on 
Friday morning, but got his voice mail which indicated he was traveling until 
Monday.  I hope to talk with Larry on Monday about this matter.

You are correct that the legislature amended the Air Act this past session to 
include a statute of limitations governing enforcement actions.  That 
amendment (H.B. 278) provides that ""no action for civil penalty shall be 
commenced more than five years from the date the violation was known by the 
department or local agency.""   (to be codified at NMSA Sec. 74-2-12.1).  The 
amendment became effective on June 15, 2001, the day after the NMED issued 
the compliance order here.  NMED doubtless will assert that the limitations 
period is not applicable here because it was not in effect at the time they 
initiated the action by filing the Compliance Order. (Ah what a difference a 
day makes.)  I will need to take a quick look to evaluate the strength of 
their position and our position that the limitations period should apply.

Charlie de Saillan used to be counsel to the New Mexico Natural Resources 
Trustee.  He departed from that position nearly a year ago and, after short 
time off, went to NMED.  He and Eric Ames are the two folks handling air 
issues these days.  I have dealt with Charlie in the past.  He is generally 
pleasant to deal with, but not always flexible in his views.  My sense is 
that he will want to strike some kind of a deal to resolve this and is not 
likely to insist on pressing for the full $15,000 per day for each day of 
violation.  From your voice mail message, it sounds like NMED was advised of 
the change out of the engines.  I will be curious to learn more about what 
they were told or provided in writing and when. I will flesh all that out 
with Larry when I speak to him.

I will be out of the office in the morning but will try to catch up with you 
and Larry as soon as I get in.

4. Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry 
on the Topock lateral.  Maybe we should have a little presentation showing  
liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral.  Our 
commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible. 

5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study 
with Penn State and what our  future plans are.  Another Tranwestern effort 
to  show our commitment.

John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been  made to 
decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters.  
If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line 
out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems.  Id like to 
discuss possibly not using  Vector for this type of routene activity any 
longer.  There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do 
the job.  As you know, this decon work is not rocket science and Vector is 
$$$$$$$, although they do a good job. 

Chew on these and if I think of any other additional topics, Ill send them 
your way.....By the way, Earl Chanley is now in Roswell.  FYI in case you

submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency 
originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the 
TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the 
emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are 
the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 
inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 
tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would 
submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The 
only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an 
increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this 
facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from 
the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that 
the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I 
have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed 
for this facility in the near future.  

In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if 
there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit 
on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with 
previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that 
this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 
(emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed 
from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating 
throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make 
written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list.

for us and PG&E, we might want to consider breaking  in a company that is 
less expensive, can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work 
product.  Vector, has to travel  from Ohio.   Deconning the separators 
becomes an internal  washing job of the vessel.  

I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else.  Tiny, do 
you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PG&E?  
As you know, they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA, but with the 
new PCB rules in place, a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning 
activities.  How do you think PG&E will respond to us possibly using another 
contractor other than Vector for the work.  I suppose we can bring this issue 
up in Flagstaff.

Subject: RE: Flagstaff Trip Rescheduled for July 24 - 26th

Larry,
Good thoughts.  I believe Rod Boschee told me he was putting the same 
thoughts on the agenda which cover your items 1-4.  However, I will take a 
close look at his draft agenda and make certain that the equivalent thoughts 
are on there.  Now, about item 5 and your closing paragraph.   Item No. 5 - I 
do not want to open the issue of the ""PCB Model"" to PG&E at this time.  Maybe 
later, but not now.  As far as your thoughts in the closing paragraph - Randy 
Rice and I want the Ultimate Separators ""deconned"".  We took great pains last 
fall (when we had the separators down) to test and decon them - so we could 
establish a ""base line"".  Why would we take the system down and change the 
filters out and test any residue without also deconning the facility?  If we 
did that - then hypothetically - next fall (2002) when we took the system 
down and changed the filters - if we took any wipe samples - it could contain 
residue accumulated over a two year period and not just during the past 
twelve months.  It seems to me that it makes much more sense to decon the 
separators at the same time that we change the filters and that way we will 
know exactly what has hit them sense the last time we opened them up.  I'm 
open to further argument on it - but that is the way Randy and I see it at 
this point in time.  

On the subject of the selection of the contractor - Randy and I believe that 
you and Tiny should probably select whatever consulting firm can do the best 
job and is most dependable.  Remember that PG&E had confidence in Vector (at 
least that is what I recall from last fall).  So, if we go with a new 
consultant - will PG&E have the same confidence?  Also, you and Tiny must 
make certain that the firm we use has some ""acceptable"" credentials.  What 
PCB issues have they handled in the past, etc.  

I will be glad to discuss any of this with you or Tiny as needed.

Thanks, John Shafer

5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study 
with Penn State and what our  future plans are.  Another Tranwestern effort 
to  show our commitment.

John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been  made to 
decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters.  
If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line 
out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems.  Id like to 
discuss possibly not using  Vector for this type of routene activity any 
longer.  There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do 
the job.  As you know, this decon work is not rocket science and Vector is 
$$$$$$$, although they do a good job. 

Chew on these and if I think of any other additional topics, Ill send them 
your way.....By the way, Earl Chanley is now in Roswell.  FYI in case you 
plan on asking him to attend the meeting........

Larry,
Glad you got this audit out of the way.  I will be needing your agenda items 
for our meeting with PG&E so we can send them to Rod Boschee.  Think it over 
carefully, and let's have all of the items we need to discuss ready to go 
over with them.  Looking forward to seeing you.  Randy and I will fly out 
early on July 24 and maybe we can have some time that afternoon and all day 
July 26 to see some of the facilities we had discussed before.  John

compliance. =20

1. Tank compliance database, general.  The database, which included 366 tan=

at the onset, has been reduced to 106 EOTT P/L tanks.  Tanks operated by EO=
TT=20
Trucking; non-EOTT tanks;  tanks sold, removed, duplicated, or otherwise=20

and 4 are abandoned in place.

2. Permit issues.=20
Federal

a. Title V permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Electric pumps a=
re=20
the norm  at EOTT tank farms, so site emissions are exclusively from the=20
tanks and do not exceed 100 TPY.  (Only Crane Station has a Title V permit)=
. =20
This statement is based on =01&worst case=018 calculations using EPA TANKS =
4.0=20
which indicated that in a:

5,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  3.6 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 7=
20=20
turnovers) produced annual emissions of 48 tons (2 tpy breathing loss, 46 t=
py=20
working loss).=20

55,000 bbl EFR tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 255=20

55,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e.,=
=20
255 turnovers) produced annual emissions of 4 tons (1 tpy breathing loss, 3=
=20
tpy working loss).=20


State=20

b. State permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Sixty-three (63) o=
f=20
the 106 tanks were constructed before 1971 (and not modified or=20
reconstructed). These tanks are grandfathered and require no permit as long=
=20
as throughputs do not significantly change. =20

All of the EOTT Texas tanks of any size constructed/modified/reconstructed=
=20

30=20
TAC 106.4 limit of 25 tpy.   No registration for the exemption is necessary=
,=20
since the tanks are not located in a nonattainment county for ozone.

New Mexico=01,s permitting program for petroleum storage tanks is being=20
developed but,  currently, there are no requirements. Therefore, all EOTT=
=20
tanks in New Mexico meet state permit requirements.  However, when finalize=
d,=20
the control requirements for tanks in New Mexico will not be more stringent=

than the federal NSPS Subpart Kb.  Therefore, a tank equipped with a floati=

4. Recordkeeping and inspection issues.  The grandfathered tanks have no=20

Note: Especially for some of the older tanks, neither a manufacturer=01,s=

Subject: TNC Membership

On a conference call on Wednesday concerning the ETS/TNC partnership, John 
Shafer was concerned about the numbers of ETS employees signing up for the 
free membership program.  John ask that I contact each of the DES's and 
coordinate with them the contact of members of all ETS teams to encourage 
them to take advantage of the free membership.  The thought is once the team 
members receive the material concerning The Nature Conservancy (TNC) they 
might as individuals or as teams be encourage to participate actively in the 
programs.

Phil Lowry endorses the program and has agreed for ETS to pay the first years 
membership.  It would probably be correct to contact your Regional Directors 
and Advisors prior to contacting the teams.  John Shafer would like to see 
100 % participation in the program.

I understand we all have busy schedules, so if you don't have time, I would 
be happy to make the contact for you.  John asked that I track these numbers 
for reporting to him on our next conference call (probably in September).  
Could I get the team names and the number of employees that have elected to 
participate.

In advance thank you for your time and effort in this matter.  Again I would 
be happy to make the contacts for you.

New land pegged for preservation


By ANNE MINARD
Sun Staff Reporter

Reader Comments

It's been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly
rejected Proposition 100, a plan to protect 290,000
acres of State Trust Land from development.
And in about a month, voters could be asked to begin
signing petitions to get another initiative on the
ballot that would protect significantly more of the
state's legacy -- 1 million acres, or about 10 percent,
including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff.

The difference, conservationists say, is that this land
has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically
and aesthetically important areas. The environmental
community rallied against Prop. 100 because they said
the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and
had little value for conservation.

For example, the Proposition 100 campaign identified 10
acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff -- near a
wastewater treatment plant outflow -- as one of the
state's ""crown jewels"" needing to be preserved.

Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included 15
acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an
industrial park and 269 acres of steep slopes littered
with shot-up refrigerators and television sets called
Turkey Hills.

Rogers Lake, an important wetland and major ecosystem
south of Flagstaff, was also slated for preservation
under Prop 100. But that plan only included its soggy
lakebed, while 2,000 acres of highly developable
shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was
still up for grabs.

THE NEW PLAN

The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers
Lake, excluding those that are private or held by the
U.S. Forest Service. One proposed parcel does still fall
in the Turkey Hills area, and three others lie between
Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon (not included is
Section 20, which is likely to be sold and developed,
but at densities that are still in dispute between the
county and the city).

Other areas would include parcels around Observatory
Mesa (a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the
Naval Observatory) and a checkerboard pattern of
sections -- interspersed with Forest Service land --
south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and
Griffiths Spring.

Like Prop. 100, an initiative would be only a first
step. If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass,
it would take an act of Congress, and a constitutional
amendment, to change the availability of State Trust
Lands.

State Trust Lands include about 135 million acres across
the country -- 9.3 million in Arizona -- originally
allocated by the federal government when each state was
formed to help fund public schools. (See related story
on Page A11.)

Brad Ack, program director for the Flagstaff-based Grand
Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative,
said the state's schools shouldn't be bought and paid
for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl. Areas set aside
under the initiative could still be leased for grazing,
agriculture or other current uses -- but they would
never be sold for commercial development.

Making an informed decision to set aside designated
State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that
now accompany proposals to develop them, he said.

The initiative is a collaborative effort between the
Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups, along
with some business and development affiliates.

And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by
the Grand Canyon Trust, the Sonoran Institute in Tucson
and the Nature Conservancy that showed 88 percent of
Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizona's State Trust
Land should be conserved.

TALKING COMPENSATION

But members of the State Department of Lands charged
with managing the tracts -- and a lobbyist for
superintendents and principals in the state's school
system -- say the initiative backers are missing the
mark in the state land debate.

""We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our
friends in the environmental community,"" said Mike
Smith, a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School
Administrator Association. ""Preserve, set aside ... we
think those are great ideas. The question is
compensation. Those State Trust Lands are in trust for
the schools. It's acutely important for schools to
maximize the returns on state lands.""

Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is
new for the state's schools. Until recently, the schools
didn't see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts.

""We haven't seen any of it. The state Legislature has
taken the annual earnings, and has used it to reduce
state aid coming out of the general fund.""

That all changed with the passage of Proposition 301,
passed last year, he said.

""In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools ...
they also said, 'By the way, all new earnings from the
state trust fund go into the school site fund.' All of a
sudden, it's real different for us. Before it supplanted
our funding, now it will supplement it. It's real money
to us.""

The Legislature will still keep the money it has been
earning from State Trust Lands -- about $80 million a
year. But anything above that mark will now go to the
schools, and both Smith and Nick Simonetta, manager of
communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona
Department of Lands, are optimistic that figure will
climb rapidly in the coming years. Simonetta estimates
the schools could see $650 million in addition to
legislative appropriations over the next decade.

LOOKING BACK

But the past irregularities are a stronghold for
conservationists who are promoting the land reform
initiative.

In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform
Initiative, the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State
Trust Lands haven't been used as they were intended
anyway, and very little money has gone to Arizona
schools.

""State Trust Lands currently provide less than 2 percent
of the annual funding for public education,"" the
document reads. ""... there is little, if any, direct
benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools.""

Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that
assessment.

""I think those statements are severely misleading and
not reflective of what is currently the case. You can
throw around percentages any way you want. If you look
at what the trust has been contributing to the school
construction budget, it's more like 30 or 40 percent.""

Regardless, Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of
State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate
funds -- and won't be given away for free.

""It comes down to this: We are in intense discussion
with the conservation community,"" Smith said. ""Our
conversations are all around the question of
compensation. We are not going to support any initiative
that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without
compensation. You can take that non-support as far as
you like. If they attempt to go to Congress, we are
going with them.""

touch for the last week.  I read John's message to you and agree with him 
that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public 
support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up and 
bite us.  As you may know, Flagstaff is one of those areas where there is 
much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and there 
does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their agenda to 
keep development to a minimum.  I will forward to you a memo from David 
Roensch, team advisor in the Flagstaff area, of an article he found providing 
the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagstaff area.  
Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled the Bureau 
of Land Management, State of Arizona,  State Historic Preservation Office and 
the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flagstaff and 
Phoenix.  I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet, but will let you 
know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if there  appears to 
be trouble on the horizon.   John and I have briefly traded thoughts on this 
project and we would  like to take a more proactive approach  ""up front"" with 
regard to public participation and input prior to breaking ground.  Its hard 
to deal with public issues when construction is underway. 

As for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies, you are correct in assuming 
that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will 
require very little capital, as long as we limit and ensure our construction 
activities to the existing right of way.  Proceeding south from Flagstaff to 
Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest.  Once the 
pipeline corridor is identified and staked, surveys will need to be completed 
for the following:   threatened and endangered plants and animals, archeology 
surveys for bones, artifacts, relics etc, noise surveys should this portion 
of the project require installation of horsepower.  The FERC will require an 
EIS (environmental impact statement) and environmental report to be 
conducted.  These activities include not only the environemntal issues but 
also things like socioeconomics, land use soils, geology etc.  Past 
consttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this 
greatly expidites the process (John has eluded to this previously).  Due to 
the rough terrain and topography of the land south of Station 2 into Phoenix 
makes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount  for 
the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entire 
proposed right of way (140 miles) from station 2 into Phoenix will need to be 
walked and surveyed by several people.  I would rather wait until we can 
identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of the 
surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a $$$$ figure.   
However, because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate, I 
would recommend an amount of $70,000 to 90,000  for the baseline 
environmental work and this might be a little light, in the event the surveys 
identify something.......please dont hold me too close to this number as it 
is a WAG contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at 
this time.  Having the pipeline corridor identified on a map will greatly 
assist in the environmental budgeting for this project.

Subject: Project Sun Devil EIS

I received the vmail from Bill last week basically stating there were no 
environmental deal killers for this new gas pipeline project, at least not 
from a 30,000 foot high level survey.  

My question is now what are our next steps?  I am building a work order 
authorization for some minimal dollars to get things like the ROW, EIS, etc. 
scoped out.  Assuming we have necessary market support, what would it cost to 
move to the next level on the EIS?  What do we get for our money?  I am 
mostly concerned about the ""greenfield"" portion of the line that would run 
from Flagstaff to Phoenix.  

Please call me at your earliest convenience to discuss an action plan.

   excelr/TransCanada -2: Analyst Calls Deal 'Unlikely'

   Dow Jones Energy Service - 08/26/1999

   (Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

   HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--excelr Corp. isn't pursuing a purchase of TransCanada 
Pipelines Ltd., a
   spokesman for excelr said Thursday. 

   ""There's absolutely no truth to the rumor that excelr wants to buy 
TransCanada,"" Mark Palmer, a
   spokesman for excelr, told Dow Jones Newswires. 

   TransCanada operates a natural gas pipeline that runs from Alberta to 
eastern Canada. It also
   operates the Nova Gas system, an intraprovincial gas gathering and 
transportation pipeline in
   Alberta. 

   Ordinarily excelr could not comment on rumors about a possible acquisition 
because of Securities
   and Exchange Commission rules, Palmer said. But the company can comment if 
such rumors are
   having an effect on the stock price, he added. The rumor has circulated 
since last month. 

   Raymond Niles, an analyst who follows excelr for Schroders&Co. Inc, put out 
a report Thursday
   morning attributing ""recent (excelr) stock price weakness"" to the rumor. 

   Niles' report said it would be ""highly unlikely"" that excelr would buy 
TransCanada. 

   excelr's gas pipeline business accounts for less that 15% of the company's 
total earnings, Niles
   said. excelr's management has said in the past that it doesn't ""need to own 
its existing pipeline
   system to grow its core energy marketing business."" 

   In the last two years, he said, excelr has moved to reduce its interest in 
non-core businesses such as
   gas pipelines. 

   excelr is also minimizing its investments in hard assets, Niles said in his 
report. The company has
   made investments in strategically located power generating assets, but 
""it's plan is to keep capital
   investments to a minimum ... and monetize existing assets.""

For example, Scenario #1 - of the 8 tanks that we have here.....
Today, we WILL receive at least 20K BBLS of sweet, and it will go into one 
tank. We will also receive more than 500 BBL of sour and put it into a 
different tank.
Tomorrow, we will pump out of that tank, and will receive into another tank 
at least 20K of sweet.
So, within these two days, we will have exceeded the limit on two tanks.

Scenario #2:
Today, we WILL receive at least 20K BBLS of sweet and it will go into two 
tanks. We will also receive more than 500 BBLS of sour into a different tank.
Tomorrow, we will pump sweet out of one tank and will continue to go into the 
other sweet tank.

So,,
On any given day, we WILL receive/pump in excess of 500 BBLS per day. This 
will happen with the use of at least 2 tanks, possibly 3. However, we might 
have four tanks full, but not flowing.

Sorry to make this so confusing.

Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She 
was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts 
to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may 
have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed 
route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did  
offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area 
which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.  

The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological 
regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and 
animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The 
TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be 
used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed 
prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of 
Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of 
ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species 
which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be 
impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction 
across Arizona.  

I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition 
to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the 
environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the 
pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and 
unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle 
on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this 
piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful 
the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known.",Non Abusive

assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWNG), a 
local distribution company  (LDC), with its corporate headquarters located in 
Portand, Oregon.  This  due diligence, which was conducted on August 7-9, 
2001,  was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures 
which may be associated with  NWNG and identify and evaluate the 
environmental risks associated with each issue.  A relative risk number 
between 0 and 3 has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential 
risk impact.  A rating of ""0"" indicates that there is no risk associated with 
this regulation or issue and a rating of ""3"" indicates a major problem or an 
issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure.  An approximate cost  
value has also been assigned to each discipline.   It is to be understood and 
explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost, conservative 
estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair, remediate or 
formally close each issue. 

Presented below, by discipline, are the environmental activities which impact 
and affect NWNG.  The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is 
based upon the availability of records, documents and discussions with NWNG 
personnel.  Therefore, this summary report is limited to the availability of 
information presented.

General Pipeline Characteristics ;

This is a dry pipeline system.  No pipeline liquids are generated, only small 
volumes of compressor oils are collected.
All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system.  There is still approx. 
100 miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future.  
The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage, 
and underground injection and storage reservoir (10.5 bcf storage capacity). 
this is a non Title V major source.
NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their 
underground storage capacity. 
NWNG is planning a 60 mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of 
2002.  All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the 
agencies.
Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern.  NWNG has 
completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas.    

Environmental Procedures Manual.   The NWNG environmental procedures manual  
appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format.  The topics 
covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company 
appeared to be involved with.  The manual addressed waste management, 
permitting,  disposal and environmetal stewardship.  There was also a written 
statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNG's commitment to 
enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG. 
Risk: 0  Cost: $0

Notices of Violation (NOV)/Notices of Noncompliance (NON).   In a summary 
page provided by NWNG, a list of all state and federal agency actions against 
the company was available.  Although the company had received a few  notices 
(<10), they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small 
recordkeeping and right of way issues.  There were no outstanding judgements, 
NOVs, NONs or pending agency actions or  issues to be resoved.  
Risk: 0  Cost: $0 

PCBs.  In interviews with NWNG, they attested to the fact that they have 
never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected.  
Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company, 
the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system  was unknown.
Risk:  1  Cost: $0        

Mercury.   Mercury was used on the NWNG system, but only in monometers and 
not in natural gas metering equipment.  A decision was made by environmental 
management of NWNG in 1986-87 to remove mercury manometers.  An investigation 
has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers 
or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment 
which may have been used. 
Risk:  1  Cost:  $3,000-$40,000

Onsite Disposal.  Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas 
plants, in interviews with NWNG's environmental management, they were not 
aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous, toxic or non hazardous 
waste.
Risk:   1  Cost:   undefined

Hazardous Waste.  There is only one location where hazardous waste is 
generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is 
used.  This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity 
generator.  The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous 
waste.
Risk: 0  Cost:  0 

NORMS.  The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually 
occurring radioactive materials (NORMS) are not a problem in the pipeline 
system.  Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this, nor does 
NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest  Pipeline Company.
Risk:  1  Cost:  $500

Underground Storage Tanks (UST).  There is only one regulated underground 
storage tank (UST) remaining on the NWNG system (Albany), and this tank is in 
complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring, testing and 
recordkeeping.  All other underground tanks have been removed.  At one of the 
tank removal sites, there exists  an active remediation in progress.  Closure 
of this site is expected in the near future.
Risk: 1  Cost: $500

LNG plants.  In interviews with NWNG environmental management, there are no 
histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural 
gas (LNG)  plants.  The exception to this is a historic site of a 
manufactured gas plant (Linnton site) which underlies the LNG plant.  This 
issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas 
Plant. 
Risk: 0  Cost:  $0

Manufactured Gas Plants.  NWNG owned and operated  a number of manufactured 
gas plants (MGPs).  Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had 
operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks.

 Eugene Water and Electrical Board. The City of Eugene has determined that  a 
parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by   numerous 
responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time 
period of 1958-1976.  The Eugene Water and Electrical Board  (EWEB), which is 
the regulatory agency in Eugene,  has determined that the total cost to clean 
the entire area will be approximately $1,300,000, of which  the EWEB has 
indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be $93,750.  NWNG has offered to pay 
compensation damages in the amount of $70,000-90,000 to  be relaesed from all 
liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City 
of Eugene.   The environmental management of NWNG  has stated that the EWEB 
has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG  offer of approximately 
$94,000.
 Risk: 1-2 Cost:  $94,000

 Salem Site. According to NWNG management, this historic MGP site has been 
remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem, which is the   
regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site.  NWNG has received 
endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature.  
 Risk: 1   Cost: $0

 Manufactured Gas Plant. This site, which ceased operation in the early 
1900's, was dismantled and  abandoned.  From the time the facility ceased  
operations, untill the present, a railroad has constructed a steel rail 
bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park.  
The site is  immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River, a major perennial 
watercourse in Oregon.  There have been no soil, groundwater or river/ river 
sediment   studies  completed  to determine potential environmental impacts.  
NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds 
of  London.  The insurance policies were not available at the time of this 
due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this 
site.
 Risks: 2-3 Costs: 0-$300,000,000

Portland Harbor Superfund Site.  The Environmetnal Protection Agency has 
determined that the Portland Harbor, on the Wilammette River,  has received 
contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify 
the 6.7 miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site.  This superfund site extends 
for a distance of 6.7 miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites, 
originally owned by NWNG.  The EPA has designated approximately 69 primary 
responsible parties  which are directly or indirectly involved in the 
contamination of this section of the Willamette River.  NWNG has been 
identified as a contributing member to the contamination.

 Linnton MGP/Wacker Site.   The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site, has 47 acres of 
water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the  Portland 
Harbor Superfund Site.  The Linnton facility, which originally included the 
Wacker Site,  initiated operation in 1913 and ceased operation in 1956.   
During the operation of the  facility operation,  various organic coal tar 
wastes, comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) and dense non  
aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) were generated.  Characteristically these 
waste products include: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), BTEX  and 
cyanide.  During the early stages of facility operation, these wastes  were 
originally directly deposited into the Willammette River, and then later, in  
1941 unlined ponds were constructed at the facility.  Preliminary 
investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility 
operations which  were released either directly or indirectly into the soil 
underlying the facility or into the Wilamette  River were in excess of 4.6 
million gallons or 23,000 cubic  yards.   It was also estimated from these 
reports that there is approximately 250,000 cubic yards of tar and tar mixed 
with soil underlying the historic tar  ponds.  

 Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to 20 or more 
years.  NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of 
London   which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNG's portion 
of this superfund responsibility.  The policies were not availble during the 
due diligence  to verify or confirm the amount of coverage.  Additionally, 
because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the 
subsurface soil,   groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not 
been determined, it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be 
evaluated.   It  should also be mentioned that because the proportionate 
extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known, adequate insurance 
coverage  appears to be somewhat premature. 
 Risk:  3  Cost:  $50,000,000-300,000,000

New Mexico showed up at my office this  morning and made a surprise 
inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.  I felt the need to tag along 
with them.... 

Heres the way it is.  The EPA is required to address all federal concerns 
when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.  Even when it comes to 
an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed 
ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species 
Act (ESA).  This is not a new issue with the EPA.  Im having the same thing 
happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the 
status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.  The 
permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air 
group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.  I 
told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that 
the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken 
care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.  (As you remember, the Navajo Nation 
verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station 
sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the 
Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a 
call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys 
with the EPA.  Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as 
to whether surveys would be required or not.  I told him that we were 
expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would 
schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.  He advised me not to 
do this.  I think his decision had something to do with  the EPA usurping 
authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without 
Indian consent.  He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to 
whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo 
Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these 
types of issues. 

Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first 
became an issue, but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly  delay

Larry -Arnold reported in the weekly meeting today that the EPA is requesting 
a T&E survey at Stations 3 & 4 prior to issuing air permits.  Don't know if 
you anticipate this being a problem or lengthy process, but Steve Burns sent 
the following message to me (which I thought I had forwarded to you-sorry 
looks like I didn't).  Any way, I don't know if he could help push the 
process along or not or if the permits he is talking about are ROW only....if 
so, give him a call.

Thanks, Donna.
The reason I ask is that we've been fighting a long political/policy issue 
here in Washington on rights-of-way across federal lands.  
Thus far the issue has focused on telecommunications (EBS and fiber optic 
cables).  The agencies we've been pitted against are the BLM and Forest 
Service, and the issue is the federal land agencies have tried to raise ROW 
fees and rents to exorbitant levels in order to get more money out of 
companies.
The agencies have recently said that what they tried to do to fiber cables 
they'll also do to pipelines.  
Two weeks ago, I spoke at a pipelines conference in New Orleans on this 
issue.  El Paso pipelines told me they've had a tough time getting 
compression station upgrade permits from the BLM for their pipeline expansion 
into California.
My request therefore would only be that IF you have any problems with the 
Forest Service in obtaining permits or new rights-of-way, and you think you 
might need some help, please feel free to let me know.  We meet regularly 
with Dept of Agriculture senior staff, and should soon meet with the new 
Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth.  We could help if you have any problems.
(Can't help you with the Navajo Nation, though!  But seriously, we'd always 
like to learn if you have problems on Indian lands as well.)

44481,campbell-l/all_documents/508.,<18834405.1075851890059.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I attended a meeting on July 30 with the Texas Intrastate Pipeline 
Association where TNRCC personnel made a presentation on the implementation 
of the grandfather legislation and Charlie Child attended a meeting on August 
7 where TNRCC also made a presentation on the grandfather legislation. 

The following existing authorization options are available for grandfathered 
sources: old Standard Exemptions, Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits 
(VERP), regular permits or Permits By Rule.  The grandfather legislation, 
which is still in the rulemaking process, is for permitting grandfathered 
sources that have not been authorized by the existing options.  These 
programs are discussed below.

Old Standard Exemptions
As you know, ETS has implemented a program to authorize grandfathered 
emission sources under old Standard Exemptions (now Permits by Rule) wherever 
possible so they would not be subject to the grandfather regulations. TNRCC 
indicated at the meeting that you would have until the deadlines for 
submitting applications (9/1/03 in east Texas and 9/1/04 in West Texas) to 
authorize the sources under old St. Ex.  Keep in mind that this program is 
not part of the TNRCC regulations-it is being implemented under a verbal 
agreement with the TNRCC and could change at any moment.  TNRCC recommended 
that PI-7 forms be submitted for all locations that are included on their 
1997 list of emission sources (Note: the list is based on TNRCC's listing of 
1997 emissions inventories and Ruth has distributed this list to the 
appropriate DESs). For locations not on this list, internal records would be 
sufficient and nothing needs to be submitted to TNRCC (unless required under 
the conditions of the St.Ex.). One thing to keep in mind is that TNRCC is 
revising the rules governing Permits by Rule/St. Ex. with increased 
recordkeeping requirements so that any emission sources authorized by St.Ex. 
will be subject to the new recordkeeping rules (scheduled to be finalized on 
9/26/01).  It is recommended that the Standard Exemption submittals be 
received by the TNRCC as soon as possible.  In addition to engines, old 
Standard Exemptions or existing Permits By Rule should be used for the 
remaining grandfathered sources (tanks, heaters, etc.).

Grandfather Legislation
The grandfather legislation includes a specific permit for reciprocating 
engines.  Other grandfather sources must obtain an ""Existing Facility Permit"" 
under the legislation.  Unlike the Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits 
(VERP) program, there is no amnesty granted for modifications uncovered 
during the permitting process.  Discovery of a modification may result in 
enforcement action.  In addition, the source is no longer eligible for a 
grandfather permit and must obtain a regular permit or Permit By Rule and be 
subject to BACT (~2 g/bhp-hr).  In order to take advantage of the VERP 
program amnesty provision, TNRCC is urging industry to submit VERP 
applications by the August 31, 2001 deadline.

Under the grandfather legislation, grandfathered reciprocating engines in 
East Texas are subject to 50% reductions of NOx and may be subject to 50% 
reductions of VOC. Recips in West Texas are subject to up to 20% reductions 
of NOx and VOC. The reductions will be determined on a case-by case basis by 
the permit engineer reviewing the application. Although previously there was 
hope that no reductions would be required in West Texas, at the August 7 
meeting TNRCC indicated that they would require at least 1% reductions in 
West Texas. TNRCC has not decided how to deal with VOC reductions but one 
TNRCC staff member did mention he was aware that oxidation catalysts could 
reduce VOC emissions on engines.

In the August 7 meeting, TNRCC indicated that the reductions for recips will 
be calculated from a baseline of the average actual emissions in 1997-9. This 
was not the intent of the legislation and the legislators will be contacted 
by our industry organizations to attempt to change this. My thinking is that 
the reductions will likely be based on a ""before"" hourly grams/hp-hr rate 
from stack testing (or maybe AP-42) and an ""after"" hourly emissions rate 
based on stack testing. 

The reductions required from recips can be averaged across a pipeline, but 
reductions mandated by a regulation cannot be included. Reductions from a 
shutdown of an emission source can be included in the average, and it was 
suggested that reductions since 1997 could be included, but this has not been 
determined. It is highly unlikely that that TNRCC will allow reductions in 
East Texas to be averaged with reductions in West Texas.

Grandfathered emission sources other than recips are subject to 10-year old 
BACT. When discussing whether there would be any relief for smaller emission 
sources such as grandfathered valves or flanges, the TNRCC attorney indicated 
that there is no lower threshold and that all emissions sources must be 
authorized either by the existing authorizations or grandfather permits by 
the deadlines in  this legislation. See the notes above about the locations 
that TNRCC expects paperwork to be submitted for St. Ex.

The control/reduction deadlines for reducing emissions from all grandfathered 
emission sources is 3/1/07 in East Texas and 3/1/08 in West Texas. However 
TNRCC indicated that controls will likely be required prior to these dates. 
When you receive your permit for grandfathered sources, they anticipate that 
you will have 18 months to install controls. Since the applications are due 
on 9/1/03 and 9/1/04, and  TNRCC has one year to process applications (but it 
could be less), you should anticipate being required to install controls in 
2005-2007. The application fee may be $450.

The grandfather rule will be proposed on October 24, 2001 and should be 
finalized in March 2002.

A couple of things to consider as you make plans for the meeting (end of 
April to early May, 2002) in Flagstaff, AZ.  You should probably take a rough 
count on attendees and confirm with the hotel there the meeting dates.  You 
should factor in any meetings that might interfere in that time frame (i.e., 
Managers/Directors Meeting, etc.).  Possibly Amelia Alder can tell you when 
any meetings like that might occur.   If you don't reserve space at the 
Little America (example: the time slot, meeting room and 60 hotel rooms, 
etc.) - you may find yourself blocked out by a convention or some other 
gathering that has the hotel booked.

Also, you should check with Kim Ladish to make sure Randy does not have any 
blockage for the dates you select.  Before you know it the time slots will 
fill up for guys like Randy.  

Also, I would approve and supply funding for your conservative purchase of 
some gift item from the Signature Shop (with excelr logo) for the attendees to 
take away from the meeting (enough to share with our SW Operating Partners 
that will join us for the second day of the meeting).  We can discuss what 
will be appropriate.  

A little planning ahead may save you some headaches later on, especially if 
you don't tie down the hotel space you will need for the meeting.  I believe 
you will have to get pre-approval from the excelr group that has to approve a 
meeting of this magnitude.

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the ""fatal-flaw"" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events

Subject: Sun Devil - Helicopter Fly-Over of Routes


	

Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the ""fatal-flaw"" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events 
coordinated.  John Shafer

As we discussed, with ENSR's assistance I have developed a projected timeline 
for developing the FERC required F-1 Exhibit (12 part Resource Reports to 
satisfy the NEPA requirement) in sufficient detail to meet the FERC filing 
requirements and expedite the processing of the environmental portion of the 
application.  The aggressive timeline assumes that the expedited FERC 
""Collaborative Approach"" will be implemented throughout the processing of the 
application.  Even with the ""Collaborative Approach"" and all of the upfront 
work done with the environmental community to streamline the processing, the 
schedule is very, very optimistic and assumes that all conflicting issues 
will be resolved quickly and the processing continue.  

I have requested that Jon Schmidt (ENSR) begin working on a detailed cost 
estimate, by quarters in two phases.  The first part of the estimate would be 
to project the environmental cost, by quarters of preparing the 12 Resource 
Reports (including the necessary field work) that would get Sun Devil to an 
FERC filing in the first quarter of 2002 that would not be rejected.  The 
second component of the cost estimate would be to complete the field work and 
permitting phases during the processing of the application.  This includes 
participating in FERC scoping meetings and agency meetings as required.  This 
would include assisting the third party environmental contractor in working 
on the EIS to expedite the writing as needed.  It would also include 
mitigation packages to satisfy agency requirements.  The third and final 
component would be to budget for a Third Party Environmental Contractor to 
write the EIS document during the time that the field work is being developed 
and to process the same with the FERC Staff.  Once we get the ""White Paper"" 
Fatal Flaw analysis that ENSR is preparing for this project we will have 
enough information along with the budget to get us to the FERC filing to make 
some quantifiable decisions on moving forward when comparing those to the 
commercial advantages that you are developing.

asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station

some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been

there are some internal problems with this program and the third party 
contractors which are on their ""list"".  At this stage of the game, they 
recommended that we do not resort to this alternative as most of the work 
that the contractor would do has been done by the ADEQ allready.  I then 
indicated that I would be contacting the Director of the ADEQ about the 
urgency of this multi million dollar project and the benefits to the state of 
Arizona.  The permit engineer thought that would be a good idea. Because we 
will be permitting through this agency again for Sundevil, and dont want to 
upset the agency cart, I am going to speak with the permit engineers 
supervisor and then to the Director of the ADEQ next week about either an 
accelerated issuance of the permit or more realistically, allowance to do 
some construction activities while the ADEQ is completing the review and 
permit writing.  This way, I wont step on any toes.  By the way, the ADEQ 
said that they dont consider this to be a PSD issue.  The following time line 
for permit issuance under the Arizona laws at this stage appears to be: 
another 2-3 weeks to write the permit, one month by the ADEQ technical staff 
to do the required internal review and then the  EPA is given a one month 
period to do their review, which is requried by the EPA for all class 1 
permit applications in Arizona.  Because Im going to be in Phoenix next week, 
I might be able to set a meeting up with the ADEQ Director and plead

except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but  I plan on dividing the guys into 
groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor 
station.  I plan on setting and hiding  some placebo environmental issues the 
night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other 
housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit.  We will then convine 
back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they 
would address the issues identified.  The group that identifies the most 
issues, will get a small gift.  Do I need your approval on the spending of 
some $$$ for a gift?  I was thinking of a couple of $25 gift certificates for

John, to my knowledge there are no ciritical habitats at either site.  In
my previous life as a consultant I did a considerable amount of work with
ESA in NM and AZ and on reservation lands.  To add to this, the whole
disturbance issue of compressor station activities from 1967 (sta. 2) and
1959 (sta.3) would strongly support your supposition that there wont be any
surprises.  Ive spoken to Region IX EPA and this issue wont delay the
processing of the permits for either station.  I would think that from the
time the reports are completed to clearnace by the Navajo Nation, would be
about 30 days.  That is the approximate time limit  that the SHPO
clearances received.  Again, weve received verbal clearance from the Navajo
Nation at these sites regarding T&Es.  The project start point is station
2, so we have some room in the event the survey approvals take longer than
30 days, but I agree with you that we need to move this along.  Ill be more
than happy to motivate the Navajos and EPA after the reports are
submitted.....Scott Patti has promised me he would let me know when the
Navajos have said ""yes"" and he would charge into the field and do the
surveys.

Larry,
Please proceed with all haste on this.  How long to complete them and
submit the findings (can't believe there would be anything turn up).  No
endangered plants in any of those station yards - I trust?  The EPA is
reaching here, but they have the big stick and we must work through this to
get the air permit.  This is a lesson's learned for the upcoming Sun Devil
project.  John

   Subject:  Re: Endangered Species Surveys, Red Rock Expansion

     The issue arose when the EPA in San Francisco said they would not
     issue an air permit unless we had addressed all concerns relevant to
     the endangered species act, even on distsurbed lands at stations 3 and
     4.  Even though we had received a verbal approval formt he Navajo
     Nation that endangered species would not be a concern by the Nation,
     the EPA felt otherwise.  This means that they wont give us a permit
     until we do a survey for plants and animals.  Because ENSR was on the
     list of contractors approved by the Navajo Nation, they were given the
     opportunity.  As you know, I have been working with Scott Patti on
     this and we have worked it through.  All that is left is to get the
     ENSR renewal permit application approved by the Nation and ENSR is off
     and running to do the surveys.  Terry, I know that you know all this,
     I just wanted to keep John and Bill in the loop on how things are
     progressing......

     Larry,

     I understand from Scott Patti that the EPA has thrown a monkey wrench
     into
     the air permitting process for stations 3 and 4 and are now requesting
     endangered species surveys.  For simplicity, we will add this as a new
     task
     for the Red Rock Expansion project.  The FT. Collins folks are
     proceeding
     based on your verbal go ahead, but to make our accountants happy, I
     will
     have to get something written authorizing the additional work.  Scott
     is
     estimating the task to cost approximately $7,000.  Since I am listed
     as the
     project manager on paper, I will put together a brief letter and get
     it to
     you this week.  However, please continue to directly coordinate with
     Scott
     and he will keep me apprised of the status.

     Thanks,

     Terry.

44503,campbell-l/all_documents/529.,<1643443.1075851890563.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Joe, presented below is the first memo I sent out concering the air permit 
issue:

[Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 
and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status 
of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.]

I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to 
another group (compliance) in the air permit section.  They strongly 
suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, 
Director of the ADEQ.  I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ 
compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back 
from her.  Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again, 
tomorrow.

Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to 
have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air 
permits:

 all earthwork
 trench construction and piping tie ins
 all foundation and building construction
 installation of ancillary equipment

This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may 
allow us to do.

Cohn      (415) 744-1238

I think you should go forward with the meeting to show that this is a 
critically important issue for TWP. I hope that Sarah can be there, but if 
she can't, is there another person in addition to yourself? Assuming Prabat 
joins Shudeish, we had anticipated this as the first step, particularly 
because we would like to resolve this with the ""first-line"" regulators for 
long-term good relations; Steve Burr will be cheering us on from the 
sidelines, to the extent he is consulted. If the first meeting is a 
stonewall, we then have to go to Cathy and Nancy, but let's make the first 
effort with Shudeish & Prabat.
A couple of thoughts. ADEQ was required to give a completeness notice within 
41 days of the application, at the latest; altho this time frame may not have 
been met, it may have been because of follow-up questions on the netting 
calculation. Also, was there any discussion whether any of the following 
applied:
     a. Facility change allowed w/o permit revision (R18-2-317)
     b. Minor permit revision (R18-2-319.A), which could shorten EPA review 
time and possibly avoid a public hearing
     c. Accelerated processing (R18-2-326.N)
These may have been hashed out in pre-application meetings, and water under 
the bridge now, particularly because it appears that ADEQ is viewing these as 
NEW permits (compare the numbers on DEQ's completeness determination letters 
with the numbers on the ""permit revision applications""), but the story of net 
benefits to air quality, as well as the need to improve energy supply to 
California, should be persuasive factors to get this back to head of the 
line, as you had been told in the spring. It may be that Shudeish and Prabat 
need to be reminded of the benign nature of this equipment change-over.
Bottom line, I think you should go forward Thursday if that is the only day 
available this week. It is important that TWP know what barriers stand in the 
way of prompt evaluation and that TWP offer what assistance it can in 
overcoming those barriers. It is important also that ADEQ understand that 
there are a number of actions that TWP wants to initiate in order to meet the 
project schedule that it had developed last spring when it received initial 
assurances of prompt review. [can you send me that list?] If Shudeish and 
Prabat are to be barriers, it is important to know as soon as possible so we 
can start moving up the chain.
There are, in fact, a number of energy projects gearing up in Arizona now, 
and the Corporation Commission's Facility Siting Committee is taking a 
pro-environment bent (following the Calif AQMDs), but a number of these 
projects also are dealing with county, rather than state, permits.
I will be available Thursday to take before and/or after the DEQ meeting.

resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.
His message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him,
that he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in
this matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his
supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that
we could choose this avenue if we desired.

Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.

Region 9 a couple of different times today.  It turns out that what they
really were expecting to see was something more like a formal Biological
Assessment (BA) for CS 3 and CS 4, not a biological survey report like we
provided.  According to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the lead Federal
agency in a Federal Action is responsible for preparing the BA, but a BA is
typically only required when the action ""may affect"" a listed species, which
is not the case here.  EPA Region 9, and based on our experience across the
country, apparently only Region 9, is interpreting their responsibilities
under the ESA very strictly and somewhat ""oddly.""  Regardless, the bottom
line is that it appears we could argue with them ad nauseum and still end up
right back here.  So, we have begun working very quickly and diligently to
put together a ""BA-like"" document that, according to Roger, will give them
what they need to put in their files to cover themselves for satisfying the
ESA.

I told him that the USFWS typically (under ""normal"" circumstances) receives
a BA from the lead federal agency and then issues their Biological Opinion
(BO).  I asked him if they (EPA) were going to still feel like they needed
any kind of concurrence from the USFWS.  He said that only if we were going
to have any findings of ""may affect"" would they maybe feel the need to get
additional concurrence from the USFWS.  I told him that you (Larry) already
have a verbal concurrence from USFWS that there are no issues, in addition
to the fact that our surveys confirmed that.  I told him that our ""BA-like""
document is going to come to the same conclusions that our Survey Report did
(i.e., No Effect).  He said that he understands, and will likely just
receive the document, assure himself that it says what it needs to say, and
is formatted in the manner he feels it needs to be formatted, put it in his
files, and put out the Public Notice for a 30-day comment period.  If this
all happens by early next week, we should still have permits by the
beginning of November. I will continue to hammer home the importance of that
schedule.  Some of us will be on a conference call with Roger and one of the
EPA attorneys tomorrow to try to ""get inside their heads"" a little bit
better regarding why they are the only Region interpreting their ESA
responsibilities so strictly.  We will debrief you after the call.  Scott

John, to my knowledge there are no ciritical habitats at either site.  In
my previous life as a consultant I did a considerable amount of work with
ESA in NM and AZ and on reservation lands.  To add to this, the whole
disturbance issue of compressor station activities from 1967 (sta. 2) and
1959 (sta.3) would strongly support your supposition that there wont be any
surprises.  Ive spoken to Region IX EPA and this issue wont delay the
processing of the permits for either station.  I would think that from the
time the reports are completed to clearnace by the Navajo Nation, would be
about 30 days.  That is the approximate time limit  that the SHPO
clearances received.  Again, weve received verbal clearance from the Navajo
Nation at these sites regarding T&Es.  The project start point is station
2, so we have some room in the event the survey approvals take longer than
30 days, but I agree with you that we need to move this along.  Ill be more
than happy to motivate the Navajos and EPA after the reports are
submitted.....Scott Patti has promised me he would let me know when the
Navajos have said ""yes"" and he would charge into the field and do the
surveys.

Larry,
Please proceed with all haste on this.  How long to complete them and
submit the findings (can't believe there would be anything turn up).  No
endangered plants in any of those station yards - I trust?  The EPA is
reaching here, but they have the big stick and we must work through this to
get the air permit.  This is a lesson's learned for the upcoming Sun Devil
project.  John

     The issue arose when the EPA in San Francisco said they would not
     issue an air permit unless we had addressed all concerns relevant to
     the endangered species act, even on distsurbed lands at stations 3 and
     4.  Even though we had received a verbal approval formt he Navajo
     Nation that endangered species would not be a concern by the Nation,
     the EPA felt otherwise.  This means that they wont give us a permit
     until we do a survey for plants and animals.  Because ENSR was on the
     list of contractors approved by the Navajo Nation, they were given the
     opportunity.  As you know, I have been working with Scott Patti on
     this and we have worked it through.  All that is left is to get the
     ENSR renewal permit application approved by the Nation and ENSR is off
     and running to do the surveys.  Terry, I know that you know all this,
     I just wanted to keep John and Bill in the loop on how things are
     progressing......

     Larry,

     I understand from Scott Patti that the EPA has thrown a monkey wrench
     into
     the air permitting process for stations 3 and 4 and are now requesting
     endangered species surveys.  For simplicity, we will add this as a new
     task
     for the Red Rock Expansion project.  The FT. Collins folks are
     proceeding
     based on your verbal go ahead, but to make our accountants happy, I
     will
     have to get something written authorizing the additional work.  Scott
     is
     estimating the task to cost approximately $7,000.  Since I am listed

waste criteria, more specifically:

at 1.41 mg/L and another at 2.18 mg/L, both below the RCRA regulatory limit 
of 5.0 mg/L.
? for all 22 samples, the samples were determined to be ""not-ignitable""
? for all 22 samples, reactive cyanide and reactive sulfide were non-detect 
with only one exception. Reactive sulfide was detected for one sample at 160 
mg/kg; this is below the guidance level of 500 mg/kg.
? the measured pH for all samples was in the range of 6.9 - 9.1; this is 
within the RCRA regulatory limits of 2.0 - 12.5.

Furthermore, the measured TPH for all samples was in the range of 131 - 9660

Selected photos of the sampling effort are attached. There was a considerable 
amount of waste debris found in the pits, particulary at the east end of the 
larger pit area.

I will be finalizing the excavation plan for the former pit areas over the 
next week or so. I will prepare cost estimates for two alternative excavation 
plans; one for a dig and haul option and one for a combination of dig and 
haul for the most heavily affected soil and on-site blending for less 
affected soil. We should try to have a work plan to the NMOCD by the week of 
October 1st.

normal issue date.  Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to 
be mid December of this year.  Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's 
management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased.  
On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction 
activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation 
construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant

quickly as possible, rather than properly characterizing the type of permit 
revision, we have developed an argument, based on the Clean Air Act (which is 
the source for Arizona's air program), that would allow construction to 
commence shortly after notice, without the need for a permit. Of course, TWP 
has already submitted a permit revision application and would be willing to 
see this process through to completion as long as TWP could begin 
construction promptly and plan on beginning operation of the new equipment 
when the permit is finallly issued, presumably in the spring.

The argument goes as follows: under CAA sec 502(b)(10), 42 USC 7661a(b)(10),  
a state program needs to allowchanges within a permitted facility if the 
changes are not ""modifications"" and do not exceed the emissions allowable 
under the permit. A ""modification"" is defined as ""any physical change in, or 
change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the 
amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the 
emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted.""

 Someone should confirm the technical status of the equipment changes and 
whether they meet the criteria. This may be something to point out to Nancy 
how she can exercise her discretion to get us where we need to go. Nancy can 
give this approval after Shudeish completes his calculations confirming TWP's 
netting calculations.

inventory should be included in the calculation of emissions fees. This leads 
to another question-what emissions should be reported on the emissions 
inventory?

I discussed this issue with a TNRCC emissions inventory team leader. He 
informed me that that is no written guidance on how to report upset, 
maintenance, start-up, and shutdown emissions on the emissions inventory, and 
as a result be included in emission fees. He did indicate that at previous 
emissions inventory workshops, attendees were verbally told to only include 
""reportable"" (emissions that exceed RQ) on their inventories, and not  
""recordable"" (non-reportable) emissions. He also mentioned that one ton/year 
would also be an acceptable threshold for including emissions in the 
inventory.

He is aware that  upset, maintenance, start-up, and shutdown emissions are an 
important issue, now that they are included in fees. He indicated that TNRCC 
will be putting out definitive information on this issue in future emissions 
inventory workshops and guidance, in preparation for submittal of calendar 
year 2001 inventories that will be due in 2002.

Subject: TNRCC Emission Fees

In the last session, legislation was passed in Texas that requires the 
payment of emission fees for upset, maintenance, start-up, and shutdown 
emissions. Previously these emissions were required to be included in 
emission inventories, but not when calculating the fees. Funds generated by 
the inclusion of these emissions are to be used by TNRCC for enforcement and 
monitoring activities for air quality permitting, air quality assessment and 
planning, and enforcement and compliance support. 
TNRCC is requiring that the additional fees for upset, maintenance, start-up, 
and shutdown emissions be included in the fees that are due this Fall for 
calendar year 2000 emissions. Industry groups are questioning the legality of 
TNRCC requiring the added fees for 2000 emissions since the effective date of 
the legislation was September, 2001. TNRCC is being requested to change this 
and legal action is being considered. I will keep you updated as this issue 
develops.

that it likely would be a fatal flaw.  He said that it would take ""an act of

is a physical impossibility. Can we take this to the next step then, to 
carefully walk through the netting calculations (Shudeish & Prabhat are doing 
this) to minimize the total emissions that can occur (""potential to emit"") at 
any one time. The way I read the existing permits, however, is that allowable 
(and unenforceable bec of grandfathering?) emissions are NOx is 1428 tpy and 
CO is 429 tpy at each station, which may mean that we can not characterize 
these as ""minor"" sources. If the netting calculation is such that we can 
avoid New Source Review (I believe this to be the case bec there is planned 
to be a new reduction), we can do the 401.01(5) construction activities and 
try to get a fast-track permit approval.
I still do not whether, as a technical matter, the applications could qualify 
as ""minor"" revisions under R18-2-319.A, which mean,
1. Do not violate any applicable requirement
2. Do not involve substantive changes to existing monitoring, reporting, or 
record-keeping requirements in the permit
3. Do not require or change a case-by-case determination of an emission 
limitation or other standard, or a source-specific determination of ambient 
impacts, or a visibility or increment analysis
4. Do not seek to establish or change a permit condition for which there is 
no corresponding underlying applicable requirement and that the source has 
assumed in order to avoid an applicable requirement to which the source would 
otherwise be subject. The terms and conditions include:
     a. A federally enforceable emissions cap that the source would assume to 
avoid classification as a modification under any provision of Title I of the 
Clean Air Act; and
     b. An alternative emisssions limit approved under regulations 
promulgated under CAA sec 112(i)(5)
5. Are not modifications under and provision of Title I of the CAA
6. Are not changes in fuels not represented in the permit application or 
provided for in the permit
7. The increase in the source's potential to emit is not significant (40 tpy 
NOx, etc) [not applicable to TWP bec net reduction]
8. Are not required to processed as a significant revision under R18-2-320 
(refers to signif change in existing monitoring terms or relaxation of 
reporting/recordkeeping or ""does not qualify as a minor permit revision...."")
If someone could make a hard analysis of the foregoing, that might provide us 
additional strength.
Van Wolf

>>> <Jerry.D.Martin@excelr.com> 9/26/2001 1:24:56 PM >>>
Van, the 3 old units and 1 new unit at each station cannot run
simultaneously.  There is only so much gas in the line leading to each
station, and there is a limit to the discharge pressure.  If we tried to
start the new unit with the old units running, the suction pressure would
decrease significantly, and the discharge pressure would increase,
automatically shutting down all units rather quickly.  Even if it was
physically possible, we would be literally ""spinning our wheels"" with no
benefit - burning fuel with no increase in throughput.

I'll be happy to explain this to Ms. Wrona tomorrow.

   Subject:  Red Rock/ADEQ: Nancy Wrona meeting

   I just met with Steve Burr, ADEQ Special Counsel, to discuss options and
   develop a strategy to rush the permit issuance schedule and/or allow
   significant construction to begin before actual issuance of the permit.
   He will attend the meeting tomorrow by teleconf because he thinks it
   would help if both of us attended as there are legal issues.

   He spoke with Prabhat yesterday, and both he and Prabhat believe this is
   a good project that should go forward expeditiously, but ADEQ must stick
   with its rules and policy interpretations. Nonetheless, there appears to
   be a way to re-interpret the application possibly to be a ""minor""
   revision. The key will be assure that, during the construction period
   and the transition period, as well as operating procedures, all of the
   equipment that could operate at the same time does not have the
   ""potential to emit"" contaminants in excess of 250 tons per year (tpy).
   For the meeting with Nancy, someone, I assume it will be Larry, will
   need to be acutely familiar with the details of the permits revisions
   applications to be able to walk this through with Prabhat & Shudeish. I
   can review this as well, in order to discuss it with Steve, but we will
   need to make sure we have our technical ducks all lined up. In that
   sense, the appropriate person should please review the Ariz air rules at
   R18-2-319.A (minor revision to Class I source permit) and R18-2-401,
   definition of ""major source"" esp subsec c (to avoid ""new source
   review""). Let me know if I need to fax these to anyone, but they may
   also be on the ADEQ website (www.adeq.state.az.us).

   For policy reasons, ADEQ needs to limit pre-permit construction because
   otherwise it would be subject to political pressure from sources with
   sunk capital costs. For TWP's purposes, the key is to keep the total
   ""potential to emit"" at each station below 250 tpy to avoid New Source
   Review. [I am out of my legal ""depth"" here and need technical
   assistance; the permit applications seem to indicate an increase in NOx
   and CO as well as a decrease in the same section (see sec 2.2 on
   Netting)as well as being subject to New Source Review (sec 3.2); there
   may some language in the applications that is somewhat misleading; the
   netting calculation is going to be important). The concern will be
   whether the old reciprocating compressors and the new turbine can all
   operate at the same time so as to result in significantly excess
   emissions. Are there operating (end enforceable) restrictions that would
   prohinbit operation of equipment that would cause emissions in excess of
   what currently allowed?

   If the permit revisions can be recharacterized as ""minor,"" either there
   are no restrictions on immediate commencement of all contruction (only
   seven days notice required) or the allowable construction is that set
   forth in Ariz law at ARS 49-401.01(5), which would allow ""installation
   of building supports and foundations, laying of underground pipework and
   construction of permanent storage structures."" It appears that
   site-deliveries could occur, but I am not sure about tie-ins.

   I am somewhat skeptical that we can get a complete ""minor"" revision
   approach because I think this is a ""major"" source and the emissions
   limitations are significant. We may, with the netting, be able to avoid
   NSR and get 401.01(5) construction, but we will need technical analysis
   to be creative as to how the revisions set up the equipment changes and,
   in particular, whether we can screw down the operating procedures and
   transition to limit the ""potential to emit.""

   Thus, it will also be important to try to get a faster permit
   review/approval schedule. We agreed that TWP's ""negotiating period"" will
   be quick. EPA needs a 45-day review, but can we get submittals to EPA
   now (these revisions are essentially the same as for Stations #3 & #$,
   which EPA is about to approve) and get a faster indication of ""no
   objections"" from EPA?

   I sense Burr wants to help us come up with creative solutions, and I
   believe this will be Nancy's intent as well. Please let me know what
   further I can do from this end to prepare for tomorrow's meeting. I will
   have the conference room ready for a pre-meeting strategy session.

Director, Air Quality Division
3003 North Central Avenue, 5th floor
Phoenix, Arizona 85012

Re: Transwestern Pipeline, Permits No. 1001601 & 1001602
        Schedule for Permits Issuance

Dear Ms. Wrona;

Thank you again for your significant assistance in detailing a specific 
strategy to complete the process to review and approve the two permit 
revisions for the Transwestern Pipeline compressor stations near Kingman and 
Flagstaff. We were impressed with your willingness and ability to focus on 
the practical approach to improving Arizona's air quality as promptly as 
possible. Working with you and your team of Cathy O'Connell and Prabhat 
Barghava gave our team from excelr Transportation Services and Transwestern 
Pipeline Company (TWP) a strong sense of accomplishment and cooperation.

Following is the schedule that we detailed for subsequent activities:
1. By Friday morning, October 5, Prabhat and Shudeish Mahadev will have 
completed the draft permits; on Friday afternoon, October 5, the ADEQ team, 
including Prabhat and Cathy O'Connell, will conduct the internal review and 
the TSD; by close of business, Friday, October 5, ADEQ will email the draft 
permits revisions to the TWP team (Bill Kendrick, Larry Campbell and me; our 
contact numbers and email addresses are listed on the attached sheet).

2. On Tuesday morning, October 9, at 9 am Phoenix time, there will be a 
call-in conference call between the ADEQ and the TWP teams for final review, 
negotiation, and agreement on the terms and conditions of the draft permits 
revisions.

3. By Thursday, October 11, or Friday, October 12, ADEQ will do first 
publication in the daily newspapers in Mohave and Coconino Counties of the 
30-day public comment period and 30-day notice of a public hearing (at TWP's 
request) for both permits revisions in Williams AZ. Toward meeting the 
agreed-upon permits revisions schedule, TWP hereby requests a hearing on each 
revision pursuant to R18-2-330(E) and asks that ADEQ include the required 
notices of hearing in all notices of the public's opportunity to comment 
pursuant to R18-2-330(C) and ARS sec 49-444(A). Second publication will occur 
a week later. We will research and confirm the mechanics for getting the 
notices published as soon as possible after the Tuesday, October 9 conference 
call; ADEQ will promptly prepare the form of notice, unless you wish TWP to 
do it.

4. On Tuesday, November 13, ADEQ will conduct the public hearing on the two 
permit revisions in Williams AZ. We have found nothing in the statutes or 
rules that would prevent having back-to-back hearings for the Kingman and 
Flagstaff facilities' permits revisions in the same place.

5. Promptly after the October 9 conference call that finalizes the draft 
permits revisions, ADEQ will send the drafts to EPA Region IX to commence 
EPA's review. TWP will confer with the EPA contacts to shorten the maximum 45 
days allowed so that EPA will complete its review on or before Thursday, 
November 15; EPA will promptly notify ADEQ of its approval.

6. On the assumption that neither the public hearing nor the EPA review 
generated any substantive comments that require further review, ADEQ will 
issue the permits revisions by Friday, November 16.

We recognize that the foregoing schedule will require significant cooperation 
among all parties, as well as working closely with EPA, but we are confident, 
based upon yesterday's meeting, that all of us from ADEQ and from TWP are 
committed to making this doable schedule work. The TWP team will promptly 
convey to ADEQ all materials it receives relating to the EPA permits 
revisions for the Leupp and Klagetoh facilities.

We also appreciated your clarification of the facilities-related activities 
that we can proceed with prior to final permits issuance. Specifically, since 
there will be no emissions impacts from the routine maintenance of replacing 
equipment and making the srubbers' tie-ins, TWP can proceed with those 
activities at the Kingman and Flagstaff sites. Additionally, we can proceed 
with the off-site fabrication of piping.

We also understand that, at the time of the first newspaper notices, we will 
post the appropriate signs at each facility duplicating the newspaper notices.

Again, thank you very much for your assistance in setting up the foregoing 
schedule and procedures. It is a real pleasure working together to improve 
Arizona's air quality.

Sincerely yours,

Jerry D. Martin

Attached is the PTE analysis for Martin Co. #1 using data provided by Ruth
Jensen.  The PTE for CO is approximately 99.38 tpy.  This is using the AP-42
factors for 4-cycle rich engines operating at less than 90% load.  This PTE
analysis is very close to the Title V limits.  CLose enough to warrant
verification of all parameters.  As you recall AP-42 factors for 4-cycle
rich burns used to be 10 g/hp-hr for equal NOx equal CO operations.  The
AP-42 engine factors were revised in 2000 which resulted in a big increase
in CO emissions.  If you use the current AP-42 factors for 90-105% load, we
bust 100 tpy for CO.

I think that I might have seen that face somewhere before, in fact that
could be one of our faces.  I found out last week that I didn't get drawn
for the deer/hog hunt that I have gone on the last two years.  Are you going
to take Ryan hunting?  If so when and where.  Right now Daniel is tied up
with being football manager and we don't get to do much.  Thanks for the air
force song that you sent, I got a big kick out of it.  I have been going to
a seminar call ""Making your children mind without loosing yours"" by a man
named Kevin Leman.  It has been really good and is Biblically based.  He has
a book out by the same name that I would highly recommend.

I just spoke with Steve Burr (he had been in Kingman last two days dealing 
with county air issues and town council). He was unequivocal that we could 
not construct buildings and foundations because these are ""activities ... of 
a permanent nature."" This phrasing is from the definition of ""begin actual 
construction"" (ARS 49-401.01(5)), which is not allowed for modificastion of a 
major source until the permit is issued. In our discussion last week, Steve 
was suggesting that we could do this if we had a ""minor"" source, but Larry 
corrected our thinking, stating  that the equipment emits more than 250 tons 
per yr NOx, which is the threshhold between ""major"" and ""minor"" source.
Our strategy now is to make sure that everyone keeps to the schedule, as set 
forth in your Sept 28 letter to Nancy. It will be especially important to 
send the EPA materials to Prabhat (copy of cover letter to Nancy and Cathy, 
copy also me) as quickly as possible and then to make sure that the meetings 
scheduled for this Friday (Oct 5) occur; let me know if I can help bird-dog 
anything.
When Sara can get me more details about the Idaho ""fast-track"" policy, I will 
pass this on to Steve Burr to see if there is any interest in integrating 
some of these ideas for natural gas transmission lines, which is the shortage 
problem in Arizona (current glut is built/permitted/under construction 
generation facilities).

Van, were you ever able to talk to Steve Burr to clarify the extent of
acceptable pre-permit construction activities?  I still know that I heard
from Nancy that we could build ""anything that doesn't have emissions,"" and
I'm not ready to give up yet -- still trying to mitigate the late
acquisition of the permit.  And, they pay me to worry about things that can
go wrong in construction.

Thanks,

Roger, I printed the Calpine permits and everything worked fine.  Am
looking forward to seeing my permits.  Any idea as to when they will be
placed on the EPA website?  The reason I ask is that I need to travel to

(not limited to them only, but they are possibly representatives of the types

heavy equipment (e.g., bulldozer, road grader, backhoe, etc) to do dirt work

employees to  perform agreed to work on RMEF projects (e.g., fence building 
and/or repair, demolish any old structures, buildings, corrals, loading pens, 
feeding and/or watering stations, etc.); to plant wildlife feed plots, etc.  
Of course, all of this type work would only be done if both parties to the 
agreement had agreed as to the type of work, timing, expense, etc.  ETS will 
provide supplies and materials needed for all projects that are agreed to by 
both (unless a third party has already agreed to provide the supplies 
needed).  You could also add that ETS would consider the funding of certain 
auction items for local chapter banquets and/or purchase a table at such 
local banquets where we have employees that will attend.  

If this kind of detail is not what he is looking for, then we might have a 
serious problem in going forward.  If he is looking for specific details of a 
project - then you will have to wait until you get a team ready to offer a 
project to the RMEF for their specific consideration.  However, that will not 
be the overall umbrella agreement that I would like to get in place.

1.  EPA did not include the stain tube request for sulfur monitoring.  The 
methods that are currently listed are wet chemistry methods.  As we 
discussed, since the permit allows us to use an APPROVED, alternate method, 
we will need to submit this request at some time.  For the time being, since 
we want to receive this permit ASAP we should be able to accept the permit as 
is.
2.  It is my understanding that the limits given on CO and NOx are based on 
ppm @ 15% O2 and not going to the full ISO conversion.  We may want to double 
check that with the agency.   Arnold -- Do we have guarantees from GE to back 
up these limits?

Summarizing the issue as I can understand them.

1. Your problem.  Cat will have to change the units at Station 2 to 3512 to 
make the driver HP for 370 kw.  As I indicated we need to also make 
adjustment so that the emissions do not exceed that of the 3508 as presented 
originally on March 21.

2. My problem.  The EPA will only allow the generators to emit a cumulative 
tonnage that works out to be 7826 running hours a year.  To get the 8736 
hours that I need the generation (at both stations) I will need to reduce 
total emissions by about 11 percent.  Obviously, in the fully loaded 
condition were at, lower horsepower is not an option.

Need some way to work these two items out to a mutually agreeable solution.  
Don't know the effect on your systems (ie: the cat engines) if a catalytic 
system is installed or if this is better then revision to the clean burn 
units (which if I recall just makes the hp worse).  

I'd also like to keep the units at 2 and 3 similar, for spare issues and 
other items, but would need to have a good idea what this is costing before I 
can approve.  

The other issue is that I need to resolve this within two days.  I be in 
Phoenix tomorrow but will leave my cell phone on.  713-850-1725.  Otherwise, 
leave a message on phone mail.  Email will not be all that great.

4.  Please review for clairty and content.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn about 
all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No. 2.  
He is checking on what the EPA can do about this.  I have spoken to Arnold 
Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement for NOx 
and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by doing some 
major gas recycling.  This is a fuel waste and costly.  Anyway, depending 
upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably 
determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40 ppmvd.  Id 
like your comments asap.


          1.  The responsible official name change to  Danny Pribble.

                         2.. The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 
25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of 
startup   and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these 
rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE   data 
indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load 
conditions of 60%and lower.

 The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of 
the time with reduced load operations (64% load) occurring  no more than 20% 
of the time.  The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in 
the application in units of lb.hr and ton/yr.  These values were accepted by 
the EPA for the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the 
EPA (See EPA Statement  of Basis document).  Because the permit conditions 
hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is   
concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of 
NOx and CO would be 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is  requesting that  a provision 
be made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 
ppmvd during the 20 % of  the time that the turbines operating conditions is 
less than or equal to 60%.

3. The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern 
to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not     normally 
used to monitor and measure sulfur in the natural gas.  Transwestern has 
received approval from the EPA for other custom  fuel monitoring schedules to 
use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the 
proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas.

which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.  The most 
critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really 
restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines.  
We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.  Let me 
know what additional information you may need. 


1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest
Operations.

2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based
on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.  At 60F
and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all
operating conditions.  However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as 
high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.

The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of
the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20%
of the time.  TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of
reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.  The potential
to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of
lb/hr and ton/yr.  These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA
for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA
Statement of Basis document). Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd
values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that
under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the
emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is
requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows
emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that
the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.

3. The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires
Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not
normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas.
Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel
monitoring schedules to use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or
gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the
natural gas.",Non Abusive
44563,campbell-l/all_documents/584.,<26207041.1075851892167.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA=
=20
permits for 3 and 4.  Briefly here they are.

First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours=
=20
of operation for the generator.  The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation=
=20
because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.  In talking to=20
Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all=20
applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not=20
triggered.   This is there policy not regulation.  What is ironic is that=
=20
they accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that=
=20
they would apply any safety factor for their comfort.  Im concerned about t=
he=20
time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.  I need=
=20
some guidance.  Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how lon=
g=20
it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic=20
converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?  In speakin=
g=20
with Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches th=
e=20
PSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro=
l=20
technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.  I know=
=20
time is of the essence.

Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and=
=20
4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr=
=20
or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppm=
vd=20
for NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, =
at=20
lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are=
=20
40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.  We cant live with this.  In our application, we=
=20
stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we=
=20
applied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented=
=20
this in lb.hr and tons/yr.  This would have covered us, but because the=20
permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed  these limits during low loads=
=20
and low temps.  I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit=20
conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with=
=20
with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou=
ld=20
bring this before his management.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.

Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for 
the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily 
set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This 
means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the 
allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This 
generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be 
operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority 
to apply a 10%safety factor.

For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers 
guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears 
that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit 
limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions 
limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.

Northern Natural Gas Company

A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to 
the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 
emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V 
facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not 
greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being 
conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. 

EOTT
A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove 
the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data 
on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for 
VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit. 

General

Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held 
next week in Albuquerque.

Byron,

Below is the letter I committed to provide Arnold this afternoon.  I see
that Vadim beat me to it by sending you an earlier email.  As a general
commentary, I would however, like to make the following clarifications on
the subject which ETS may find useful.

Particulate matter in the gas tubine exhaust comes from a variety of sources
and may include smoke, ash, corrosion and erosion products, condensable
hydrocarbons, inlet air particulates and particulates from the fuel and
injected water or steam when applicable.  In addition, SO3 in the exhaust is
generally trapped on a wet collection medium as H2SO4 and may appear as
particulates due to the measurement procedure.

Gas turbines are very clean burning and are not, in general, sources of
significant quantities of particulate emissions when burning good quality
fuels.  With distillate fuel containing less than 0.5% by weight, sulfur,
total particulates at high power are expected to be less than 0.6 lbs. per
1000 lb. fuel as measured by EPA Method 5.  Please note that the method used
for measuring particulate matter can have a significant impact on the
particulate level determined.  For estimating purposes, all particulates may
be considered to be in the size range less than 10 micrometers.

With pipeline quality natural gas, there is virtually no smoke and the fuel
contains no sulfur or ash.  As a result, total engine generated particulate
emissions are generally undetectable by EPA Method 5.  Due to other
particulate sources and the sensitivity of the measurement method, total
particulates with pipeline quality natural gas for the LM2500 are estimated
to be less than 3 pounds per hour assuming cleanliness levels for the inlet
air, fuel, and water/steam injection in accordance with GE requirements.

Regards, Jos,.

activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.

Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and 
has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the 
permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e 
mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete, 
but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to 
the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15 
and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ 
plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in 
Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is located approx. 
30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council 
Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no 
responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process, 
they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring 
sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel 
monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them 
otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer 
for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also 
an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions 
from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.

Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for 
the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also 
approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There 
are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment 
period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it 
will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on 
the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this 
date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for 
station 3 and or 4.

Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.

44592,campbell-l/all_documents/61.,<30858876.1075851878914.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia 
concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline 
Company offers the following response:

Pipeline Integrity.  With the construction of the evaporation ponds over 
Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored 
the potential for  impacts for the pipeline.  This includes a more frequent 
inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking 
potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present.  
Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the 
potential of pipeline corrosion.  As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has 
cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline 
coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the 
evaporation ponds.   The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern 
are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system 
at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also 
allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art 
monitoring and detection. 

Noise Issue.  In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern 
conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels.  
This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures 
which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso 
Station.  Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post 
noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above 
those levels mandated by FERC.  In the event of operational noise levels 
exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to 
performing any and all  mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post 
noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC.

Decrepancy of trailer park residents.  In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was 
stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the 
adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study, 
but ""more like 35 trailers"".  The number of mobile home residences currrently 
in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.  Transwestern's trailer park 
residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job 
market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low.  
The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job 
economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature 
of the residences.  It should also be noted that during the time that the 
trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the 
operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the 
operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments 
and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the 
trailer park residents.  It was actually noted that many of the spaces 
normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.  This unsanitary 
condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.  The 
NMED had implemented enforcement actions against the trailer park owner.     ",Non Abusive

Kohn,EPA permit engineer,  about the possibility of not doing the turbine 
installation at station 4 only due to what you described as not enough market 
commitment.  My plans are to hold off on making any decisions and have the 
EPA issue the station 4 permit.  If we do not initiate any construction 
pertaining to the turbine or auxillary generators, then the new permit doesnt 
apply and we can still operate under the existing permit which was issued 
about 2 years ago.  In excelr, 6 months is an eternity and who knows what will 
happern then?  By having the permit, but not constructing, we will be  OK.  
If we decide to do the turbine project  within the period of time that the 
permit is valid, then were ahead of the game.  If not, and a more firm 
decision is made to not do anything in the future, Ill contact EPA and 
request termination of the permit.  Usually, the agency places a caveot that 
if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit 
automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions 
of the existing permit for the facility..

John, I agree with your points.  Has EPA already been notified?  If not, we 
should put the proper spin on it, which, in my opinion, should come from 
Marketing.  Something like, ""we tried hard, and continue to try hard, to sell 
more capacity, but the market has not cooperated, so we must defer (not 
cancel) the station for now.  We haven't even told FERC yet, so you are the 
first to know.""

Larry,
(Caveat: The following is just an observation at this point and the view 
expressed is my own).  What concerns me most about this scenario is that we 
pressured the EPA Region IX quite a lot to get this permit and now we are 
just going to let a portion of it go ""null and void"".  At least, the portion 
applicable to Station 4.  I know we didn't lean on the EPA as hard as we did 
the AZDEQ, but we did repeatedly call them.  Even the FERC Environmental 
Staff was calling Region IX asking when were they going to get the draft out 
- because the FERC was under the assumption that we needed all or none.  

At a time when excelr's veracity has come into question all across America, 
its too bad there isn't a better way to handle this.  Don't be surprised the 
next time you go in asking for expedited treatment on a federal air permit, 
if the regulators look at you with a ""question"" mark.  I wouldn't say we 
""burned bridges"", but we definitely used some ""green stamps"".  There are only 
so many ""green stamps"" that we can use with an agency and we used a bundle on 
this one - and now we don't need it.  John

This is to confirm our conversation today, the Transwestern Red Rock
expansion currently is scheduled to replace the existing units at Station
1, 2, 3 and 4 with a new unit at each station.  Due to market conditions,
Marketing and Operations have agreed to officially remove Station 4 from
the Red Rock expansion.  We will need to prepare (overhaul) the existing
units at Station 4 to flow the new incremental 120 mmcf/d.
With this information Environmental Affairs can withdrawal the air permit
application for Station 4 and Regulatory Affairs can make necessary

Subject: ADEQ permits: public hearing


As Larry has probably reported to you by now, the public hearing last night 
in Williams was accomplished with a satisfactory result. Shudeish had copies 
of the draft permits, which Larry reviewed and found satisfactory. 
Apparently, about three weeks ago, Prabhat Bargava left his DEQ position as 
Section Manager, Compliance, to take a position with a consultant, CH2M Hill, 
which is trying to start an air group in Arizona.
I just spoke with Shudeish about how soon the actual permits will be issued. 
He said that DEQ had to wait a few days after the November 23 close of the 
comment period (this was announced at the hearing) to allow mailed comments 
postmarked on Friday, Nov 23 to reach DEQ. He then said that he expected both 
permits would be issued middle to end of next week (by Nov. 30): he said he 
had to blend the EPA issues into the permits, but that was not problemmatic. 
Larry talked with Shudeish last night about the EPA issues, and that did not 
seem to be any difficulty.
I then asked Shudeish why the comment period was extended until Nov 23 when 
the rule states that the comment period is only 30 days long and the comment 
period opened by first publication on October 17. The public hearing also 
must be no sooner than 30 days after first publication, and that is why it 
was set for Nov. 19. Thus, even allowing for a couple of days after what 
should have been the close of comment period (Nov 19, because Nov 17 was a 
Saturday), the permits should be issued by the first of next week rather than 
the end of the week. Shudeish said he would check and get back to me.
I know this is only a couple of days difference (assuming the permits are 
issued by Nov 30), but I am sensitive to Jerry's urgency to get moving 
quickly, and I also want to lay some groundwork to object if actual issuance 
starts dragging.
Please let me know if you have any thoughts or comments.

I spoke with Darron Blackburn regarding the Burger, Crane, and Sonora
accounts.  Darron has told me that the blue fee return sheets indicate that
EOTT submitted zero fees for these three accounts.  Darron indicated that
these sites had either NSPS sources or an active Title V permit.  Therefore,
fees would be required.  A fee would not be required if there was no
intention of operating the sites in the 2002 fiscal year (September 1, 2001
through August 31, 2002).

1. If a fee is owed but the site did not operate in 2000, then EOTT would
owe the minimum fee - $26.
2. If the Title V was not officially terminated prior to Nov.1, then the fee
is required if the source operates in the fiscal year.

Our database shows Burger and Sonora to be out of service.  Therefore, a
2002 fiscal year fee would not be required.  This needs to be communicated
to Mr. Blackburn in writing.  Our database shows Crane to have all
grandfathered tanks.  Therefore, the only trigger for a fee would be an
active Title V permit.  Do you know if the TNRCC has voided the Title V and
if so when?

this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management 
and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 
(86%).  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses 
for PCB activities in California.  On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph 
Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their 
system and are presented below:

SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on 
portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.  It is these 
portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to 
declassify.  These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal 
system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the 
fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor 
stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot 
California.  Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, 
it appears  the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline 
areas.    

SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss 
the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides 
natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.  The location 
of this  interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca.

Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 
interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.  As you know, Transwetern 
supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 
2 separators will be approx. $33,000 plus installation charges.  Ralph stated 
that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002.  Of 
note, Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side 
of the interconnect which means that maintenance and operation of each 
separator will be SoCal's responsiblility.  these charges will be passed on 
to Transwestern at 86%.",Non Abusive

this facility  emit emissions which would trigger a Title V air permit.  
Steve San Miguel and Stoney tried to conduct an emissions test  with a 
portable analyzer but were unable to collect representative emissions data 
due to the fact that the unit was in very poor mechanical shape and showed 
very high emissions.  We have a couple of options.  Spend the $$$$ necessary 
to bring the unit up to standards that allow a representative emissions test 
to be conducted and determine whether the emissions from the units trigger 
permit action or use the new EPA data and submit an air permit application.

acquire  excelr.   We  expect the transaction to close following shareholder
and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even  though  excelr  has  entered  into  this  agreement,  U.S. and foreign
antitrust   laws   require  that  excelr  and  Dynegy  continue  to  operate
independently  of  each other.  In particular, to the extent that excelr and
Dynegy  are  competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective
activities  must  be  undertaken  at arm's length until the transaction has
closed.   Therefore,  for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you
would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In  addition,  all information, documents and communications related to the
merger  between excelr and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved
by  Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls
or Greg Whalley of excelr.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be
maintained.   To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to

on a section of pipe between C/S 3 and C/S 4.  This might be  a good

As I mentioned in the conference call last Monday , I have set up an 
appointment with Michael Adewuni at Penn State for 9 am on Tuesday October 26 
for the purpose of reviewing his pipeline flow model and potential 
application to predicting PCB movement and collection points in pipelines.  
He has performed previous research studies utilizing various hydrocarbon 
solvents , including  terpinol.  

Dr. Adewuni has requested that we provide to him before the meeting the 
following information:

Drawings of the particular section of pipe and the configuration;
The general volumes of condensate passing through the pipeline;
The natural gas flow rate and variables
General PCB concentrations found in the section.

Please respond and let me know who will take the responsibility for selecting 
the section of pipe and providing the requested information?

Dr. Adewuni 's email address at Penn State is ----    michael@pnge.psu.edu

Please also provide a duplicate information package to me prior to the trip 
for review.



Thanks Mike

Tim,
 ET has had wholesale changes in its personnel recently. Here's the
three contacts that I talk to:

 East   John Ed James  713-371-6673
 Midwest  Tom Dickey   713-371-6163
 West    Allen King    713-371-6123

 If they can't handle the transaction, they know who can. Note that
both John Ed James and Tom Dickey will be leaving the company at the end of
the summer. Allen King is basis backup for the West, but he has always
handled my FOM deals (Allen will be moving with ET to Bethesda). Minor
intramonth changes usually can be done by the scheduler at ET, they'll tell
you if you need to talk to a trader.

  Thanks,

Subject: Con Edison's Capacity Release/Delivery Service Programs for the 2=
=20
000/2001 Winter Season



As a result of feedback received at the July 6 reliability collaborative,
Con Edison has made the following changes to its capacity release/delivery
service programs for the 2000/2001 winter season.

First, to assist you in meeting your primary point obligations relating to
the firm load on our system that you are serving, Con Edison will make
available to Marketers 25,000 dt/day on Transco.  Your allocation based on
active customers in your group as of July 1, 2000 is
511 dt/day in the form of either:

  (a) a capacity release of Transco capacity at the
Transco maximum
   rate for the 12-month period November 2000 through
October 2001,
   or

  (b) a bundled citygate sale for November 2000 through
March 2001 priced
   as follows:

*  Inside F.E.R.C.=01,s first of the month index price at
    Transco/Zone 3 (Station 65) plus $1.00/dt.

 or;

  (c) a combination of the two adding up to 511 dt per
day.


Second, in addition to the above, we can make available to you 204 dt/day
during March 2001 as a bundled citygate sale on the same terms as set forth
above.

Third, with respect to the balance of capacity that you may require to meet
your primary point obligations,

  (a) There will be no citygate allocation requirements
for this winter, except for the 25% limitation on Texas Eastern. (i.e., you
may deliver     all of your gas to any of the
following receipt points, except that no more than 25% may be delivered to
Texas Eastern.

       Transco (Receipt
Point: 134th Street - Manhattan, Central Manhattan, Narrows or Long Beach)

       Tennessee (Receipt
Point:  White Plains)

  (b) We will permit you to meet the primary point
requirement using your Daily Load Following Service Quantity (for Load
Following Service)  or Daily Load Quantity (for Daily Delivery Service)
during November instead of the Average Day/Peak Month quantity used during
the remaining four winter months.

  (c) Prior to the winter, you can trade all or part of
your citygate allocation on Texas Eastern to another marketer, so long as
the aggregate entitlement for deliveries on Texas Eastern among all
marketers remains below 25% of the combined total allocation.

Please let us know on or before close of business Friday, July 28, 2000
which, if any, of the above-described services you are interested in.

NOTES:
1. We will advise you if additional capacity becomes available as a
result of actions taken by other marketers.
2. Bundled sales service is subject to the execution of a written
agreement (on mutually agreeable terms), including a take-or-pay commitment
and resolution of any creditworthiness issues.

either forcing them to justify why we should continue the sampling when the

inability to get the guilty party to get moving on this, spending additional

calls for biennial sampling. In light of this we were due to sample this past 
August. I held off on sampling in hope that Texaco would soon assume this 
responsibility, however, since it does not appear that this is going to occur 
anytime soon enough I will schedule a sampling event within the next four 
weeks. Since there are only six monitor wells to sample at this site, 
sampling can be completed in one day by one person at a cost of about $2500 
(including expenses and lab costs).

reviewed the reports and results of the studies conducted by us and them and 
the evidence weighs in our favor.  At your leisure and prior to the November  
OCD meeting,  prepare a memo to file of the resaons and justification based 
upon the report results and data why Eunice is not the bad guy in this and 
why Texaco is.  Gradients,  plume elevations and characteristics of the 
contaminants show that this is not our problem.  Id like to have sufficient 
evidence, both mine and yours, to force OCD to go afterTexaco and  get us out 
of this issue.  

I think this would also help Bret's case for having Texaco (or whoever is 
responsible)  reimburse Northern  for the costs we have incurred for what is 
Texaco's problem.

44683,campbell-l/all_documents/70.,<28209390.1075851879126.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Two points were apparent after my last conversation with Bill Olson about a 
month ago:

1) Texaco has convinced Bill that the plume of elevated TDS originates from 
an offsite source; an old waterflood operation toward the northwest and 
upgradient of the Texaco and NNG facilities. Although our data from 2-3 years 
ago indicated the source as Texaco's old brine ponds, Bill indicated that 
Texaco has more recently presented data that is more regional in scope and 
implicates the waterflood operation. I have not seen any of this recent data.

2) Bill has accepted Texaco's single soil boring in the former crude oil pit 
area as evidence that the pit was not the source of oil found in NNG's 
monitor well MW-3. I don't agree, but our best chance of convincing him 
otherwise will not come until Texaco excavates the old pit area and completes 
the additional assessment activities we agreed to in our meeting with them 
last year.

In light of these two points, I think it is going to be difficult to convince 
Bill that NNG should not adhere to the biennial sampling until things are 
settled between Texaco and NNG. However, if you are going to give it a shot, 
I suggest that you present the position that:
1) Texaco has already demonstrated (whether correctly or not) that the 
dissolved phase plume of TDS originated from another source;
2) Texaco has already demonstrated that they were the source for the 
dissolved phase plume of benzene measured in NNG's fenceline monitor wells; 
and,
3) The only unresolved issue is the presence of PSH in monitor well MW-3.
In light of this, the only monitoring NNG should be responsible for is 
measuring PSH thickness in well MW-3 since it makes no sense to collect 
groundwater samples from a well containing free product. 

Also, the last information I have on Texaco's activities is an assessment 
report dated July 1997. If you would get a copy of any more recent reports 
and correspondence it would be a big help. 

Another thought to consider, prior sampling history indicated a declining 
trend of benzene concentrations at NNG's fenceline monitor wells. If this 
trend has continued, additional sample data would be beneficial to our future 
discussions with Texaco and the OCD.

Bret, what do you think about this?  We have pretty much proven that we are 
not the culprits is this activity.  I have a problem conducting an ongoing 
sampling for an issue that were not responsible for, even though we initiated 
the sampling activity.  I plan on visiting the OCD about this issue and 
either forcing them to justify why we should continue the sampling when the 
data points to our neighbors.  Additionally, because of the turnover and 
inability to get the guilty party to get moving on this, spending additional 
money and not receiving any return seems like a waste of time.  Thoughts....

because at the time the Laguna's did not have an environmental staff person 
to address such issues. Subsequently, Ms. Bernacik was hired as the Laguna's 
environmental staff person about two years ago. 

In the course of Norm's conversation with Ms. Bernacik and Mr. Lucero, Mr. 
Lucero indicated some concern that the Pueblo of Laguna had not been kept

Subject: BTU factor


Due to internal issues, the BTU factor, previously reported to the marketers
for the month of August 2000 as 1.027, was incorrect.


The correct BTU factor for August 2000 is 1.029.

Any questions may be directed to my attention.

accurate, for the purposes of a historic account and and in as far as  what 
was provided to him in the way of data and history.  His proposed scope seems 
to be conclusive and appears to be what we need.   I have included Louie in 
the distribution  and am sure he will have some input. 

My comments are as follows:

1.  I dont know how relevant it is to know about the customers facilities at 
this time.  As you know, we have more than one customer (PG&E and SoCal), and 
I  think that we should maintain a low profile especially with respect ot 
SoCal.  Both parties in the past,  have been helpful and very cooperative in 
matters  pertaining to PCB's. Because the modeling study will be conducted 
between C/S 3 and C/S 2, the customers facilities should have no impact on 
this.  

2.  Also, I would like to see if we can deal with  PCB's and arsenic at the 
same time?  Is it possible to simultanously model both contaminants?

3. Because the modeling efforts are conducted on a very small portion of the 
pipeline, can this section be used for all of the Transwestern system?  In 
leau of  the fact that we have pipe under rivers, over rivers, major 
elevation chages in short distances etc which are not covered in the section 
to be modeled, will  the pipeline characteristics be covered to the extent 
that it will yeild information applicable to the entire pipeline system?

4. I am also concerned about stirring up the PCB's and moving additional 
PCB's into the SoCal system.  Its been pretty quiet  in discussions with the 
SoCal  PCB person.  I wonder if we should notify Ralph Komai to be on the 
alert when we start the cleaning?  Louie, thoughts?

5. Injection of terpenol into the station yard piping.  How will we do this 
and how do we get it out?

6. Impact of terpenol on gaskets, engine parts, etc.

Subject: The Draft of the PCB Cleanup Proposal



Dear Mike, David, Larry and Ben:
 Please find attached the draft of the PCB migration/cleanup proposal as
promised. This is only the technical portion of the proposal. Once we agree
on the specific scope of the work, the necessary man-hours and the
associated budget can then be developed.
 In addition, we have studied the material given during our meeting and have
developed a preliminary list of the data that we would need from you once
the project begins. I have decided to attach the list so as to give you
adequate time to collect and/or collate this information.
 Please give me your feedback on the proposal as soon as possible so that we
can develop the final version and submit an official proposal. Equally
important, the more preparation and planning we do at this stage, the faster
the progress that would be made once the project actually begins. Thank you
and have a wonderful weekend.

all went well.  Prior to the state visit, we went through a ""trouble 
shooting"" scenario and found out that Solar provided us with innacurate 
permitting information for that altitude and temperature.  Solar was very 
helpful and provided us with updated information to reflect conditions at the 
facility.  I submitted a permit revision and it was submitted to the state of 
Colorado prior to their inspection, requesting more fuel but no more 
emissions.  Recent testing has shown that even under extreme low 
temperatures, the emissions are under the original permitted levels.  Because 
we did not request additional emissions, I expect the permit to be issued 
within the next couple of months..... bottom line is that no NOV will be 
issued for the fuel use issue.

Larry---

Will the permit exceedances mentioned in one of your recent weekly reports at 
the La Plata station result in an NOV?

Thanks, Bill

I just received a call from the TNRCC concerning an air quality inspection to 
be conducted at the above referenced facility on November 30, 1999.  The 
person conducting the inspection will be arriving onsite at 11:00 am.  I am 
planning on being present for the inspection.  It would be a good idea to 
have available and at the site the following:

 emissions fees paid for the last 3 years

 emissions inventories submitted for the last 3 years 

 1999 natural gas throughput

 inlet gas analysis for 1999

 H2S analysis for 1999


Also have the facility's air permit history for as far back as you can go.  
If your records have been entered into envisions, spend some time getting 
familiar with the data retrival and look like you know what you're doing on 
the 30th.

If requested, I can drive over on the 29th and assist you guys in getting 
ready for this......let me know.....

Alert Posted: 4:25 PM October 7, 2000: Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pool :
South GA. VAldosta
Therefore, for Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., Valdosta primary pool
 will be under a Demand Mismatch Order.
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
This demand mismatch order carries a potential incentive charge of $30.00/dth 
for under deliveries to AGLC's system.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.
If you have any questions regarding the demand mismatch order, please call 
Brad Freeman at 404-584-4993, or Gas Operations at 404-584-4477.

Subject: NYISO Newsflash: External load a good deal



All,
?
You may already be  aware of this, but NYISO staff just revealed in a meeting 
that significant  opportunities exist to purchase in real time from the NYISO 
LBMP market at the  PJM proxy bus (i.e., as an external load), due to the 
impact of ECA 1006B.?  When the tie is import constrained in BME, prices 
there since the 1006 ECAs were  implemented have been as low as -$1000.? In 
this case the BME price would  be used for settlement, and you would be paid 
$1000/MWh to export power there  (as your export would offset inbound 
congestion).
?
As more people begin  to take advantage of this, the BME prices can be 
expected to be less  negative.
?
Caution!? If  you schedule a transaction DA, but it fails the DA checkout, 
when there is  congestion on the ties in BME, you will have to settle the 
difference at the BME  price, and could get hammered.
?
NYISO will probably  issue a bulletin about this later today.
?

  cattle from crossing.  For some reason the bovines will not step on the
guards, probably because they fear getting their feet caught between the
rails. I need to make that clear in order for you to appreciate the
following true story:

President Clinton received a report that there were over 100,000 cattle
  guards in Colorado.  Because Colorado ranchers protested his proposed
  changes in grazing policies, he ordered Secretary of Interior Bruce
  Babbitt to fire half of the guards immediately. Before Babbitt could
respond, and presumably straighten him out, Colorado's congresswoman
Pat Schroeder intervened with a request that before any were fired, they
be given six months of retraining.

  Al Gore, never one to pass up a chance to piggy back on any story,
pointed out that if the Guards had formed a strong union, such as the
teachers have with the NEA, they would not be in jeopardy.

  ....And so it goes, in this election year.  Don't you just love the
smell of political napalm in the morning?  We are governed by a pack of
fools!






What is a Goron?


1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
    environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his
own
farm: a
    polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income
last
year.

2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is anti-smoking and
anti-tobacco
    when he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted
government
    subsidies.

3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in
fact
he
    was placed by family influence in a ""cushy"" correspondent's job
and
the
    only action he saw was that of his Brownie camera!(and his bong)

4. Gorons actually believe that Al Gore is justified in illegally
raising
    political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt
    Law educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al Gore to accept large
sums
    of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had
taken
vows of
    poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to ""invent the
internet""
    would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks of
    potentially incriminating e-mail!

7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the
    models for the book and movie, ""Love Story"" even though the
book's
author,
    Erich Segal, says that's a bunch of crap.

8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion
    against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars
in
    Occidental Petroleum stock.

9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's
    immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent
on
the
    subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton ""one of the
greatest
    Presidents of our history.""

  10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't
    bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
    ineffective that it has led to election of Republicans as BOTH
of
    Tennessee's senators.

  11. Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be
    the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he
served
to the
    poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum
    house that he was renting to them.


  Cautionary Note:Medical researchers acknowledge the Gorons are
generally
   harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately,
   overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to actually
vote
for
   Gore! They should be carefully protected from their ailment,
since
it
may
   be harmful to their well-being, yours, mine, and that of the USA.
   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out
to
aid
   the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and PLEASE pass this on to
your
   normal friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.",Non Abusive

Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project 
proposed for the Transwestern mainline system.  David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi 
and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon 
his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the 
model will yeild some useful information.  Adewumi was asked about the 
simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can 
address this situation.  He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline 
segement  selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information 
could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and 
elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected.  As is the 
case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be 
addressed until we begin the process. 

It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact 
Michael Adewumi.  David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and 
operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input.  It may also be in 
the best interest of this project  to see a team of technical and operational 
experts from excelr and Transwestern begin a  brain stroming of this project 
during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning 
trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping.  By working through 
the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns  and 
increase the cleaning success.  Although Transwestern has been involved in 
this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data 
results, the system has met with variable success.  The more technical and 
operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be 
the modeling conclusions and results of the  cleaning activity. ",Non Abusive

the pueblo of Laguna to Transwestern's environmental activities at the 
facility.  The Laguna's have hired an environmental person to oversee 
environmental issues on pueblo lands.  The meeting centered around three 
issues:  a UST site which had been removed, but not formally closed, a 
historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the 
late 1980's, and the ongoing groundwater remediation at  the site.  

Transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why 
these issues were unresolved in the ""eyes"" of the Laguna.  Transwestern 
committed to submitting closure requests for the UST and asbestos issues.  
With repsect to the groundwater issue, a presentation was given enlighting 
the Laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology 
and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants 
(chlorinated solvents and PCB's) and Transwestern's intent to continue its 
remediation efforts. Transwestern assured the Laguna environmental 
representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental 
issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency.   At the conclusion of the 
meeting, the Laguna's understood Transwestern's commitment to maintaining the 
policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of Laguna.

The meeting provided Transwestern and the Laguna's with the opportunity to 
meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships.  The 
Laguna's now have an understanding of the environmental activities at the 
site and what Transwestern's approach is to removing the contaminants.   The

compliance on the Laguna pueblo.",Non Abusive

Attached is the letter and analysis spreadsheet sent to Rod Boschee today. 
The letter outlines the additional interim steps identified at this weeks 
meeting. The letter also contains reference to a spike in the analysis 
results at Transwesterns Measuring Station filter separator. The split sample 
came back at this site at 216/185 PPM. We are making arrangements to have the 
sample rerun at another lab. All other analysis points remained consistent 
with last week. Lou Soldano advised me that since the spike occurred on our 
equipment, that it may not be worthy of my personal phone call to Rod.

Lou Soldano has also prepared a draft of a letter for you to send to Mr 
Mazotti regarding our on going concern and additional plans. He has, or will 
be sending that to you directly.

If you have any questions, please call.

Mike

the turbine other than sample all surfaces for teh verification sampling???  
Assume that we do not have large surfaces, only many, many small and/or 
irregular surfaces..???




Susan Fernandez   12/10/99 01:38 PM

Subject: PCB Decontamination of Turbine

Lou - 

Under the PCB Mega rule, self-implementing decontamination of PCBs (i.e., 
cleanup without verification sampling) is only available for PCB containers; 
movable equipment used in storage areas, tools and sampling equipment; non 
porous surfaces contaminated with mineral oil dielectric fluid; and air 
compressor systems.  40 CFR 761.79(c).  EPA has yet to provide written 
guidance on its PCB Mega Rule decontamination regulations.  Based on my 
reading of the regulations, a contaminated turbine must be decontaminated in 
accordance with the measurement-based decontamination methods.

The measurement-based decontamination procedures are not prescriptive.  The 
simply require that the non porous surface be cleaned by a method that 
reduces the surface concentration to less than or equal to 10 micrograms PCBs 
per 100 square centimeters if the equipment is decontaminated for 
unrestricted use or less than 100 micrograms PCBs per 100 square centimeters 
if the material is to be disposed of in an industrial smelter after 
decontamination. 40 CFR 761.79(b).   I assume that the most efficient method 
of ""cleaning"" a turbine would be to drain the turbine of all free flowing 
liquids and then wipe or soak all surfaces that were exposed to PCBs with or 
in solvent.

If a solvent is used to clean the surfaces, the regulations require that it 
have a solubility of PCBs of 5% or more by weight (other parts of the 
regulations recommend Kerosene, diesel fuel, terpene hydrocarbons and a 
mixture of terpene hydrocarbons and terpene alcohols).  The solvent can 
continued to be used until it reaches a concentration of 50 ppm PCBs.  40 CFR 
761.79(d).

Once the surfaces have been wiped clean with the solvent, verification 
sampling can be done using the standard wipe test at locations on the turbine 
selected under Subpart P (which includes the sampling of small and irregular 
shaped surfaces).  If the measurements show the surfaces have been cleaned to 
< 10 ug/100 cm2, the equipment is available for unrestricted use.  40 CFR 
761.79(b)(3)(1)(i)(A).

Persons participating in the decontamination activities must use protective 
clothing or equipment to protect against dermal contact of inhalation of PCBs 
or materials containing PCBs and take precautions not to release PCBs into 
the environment from the decontamination area.  40 CFR 761.79(e).

Written records of the sampling procedure used to verify that the equipment 
has been decontaminated and sampling results must be maintained for 3 years.  
The regulations do not require that a written record of the procedure used to 
decontaminate the material be generated or maintained.  40 CFR 761.79(f).

Decontamination wastes and residues that are generated by rinsing or soaking 
contaminated surfaces with solvent can be disposed of at their existing 
concentration, which means that hydrocarbon solvents used which contain <50 
ppm PCBs can be marketed as used oil.  40 CFR 761.79(g).

The non-liquid cleaning materials (e.g., rags) and personal protective 
equipment, regardless of concentration, can be disposed of at a municipal 
landfill, a industrial non hazardous waste facility, a RCRA subtitle C 
facility permitted to accept PCBs or a TSCA PCB disposal facility.  40 CFR 
761.79(g)(6).

Finally, notification to the EPA is not required.  Verification sampling 
procedures and analysis must be available for EPA review when requested.  40 
CFR 761.79(f).

A very simple procedure would be:

1.  All persons participating in the decontamination activity must wear 
personal protective equipment that protects from skin exposure that prevents 
inhalation of PCBs. 

2.  Drain turbine of all free flowing liquids.

3.  Wipe all surfaces or parts the would or could have been in contact with 
liquids with rags soaked in clean, unused solvent such as Kerosene.  

4.  Collect all personal protective equipment and rags used during the 
decontamination process in drums for disposal.

5.  Collect all used solvent and appropriate containers (Drums?).  Collect 
sample of solvent and have it tested to determine disposal options.

6.  Sampling cleaned equipment by collecting wipe samples at locations 
determined under Subpart P of the regulations.

7.  If verification samples indicate equipment is contaminated at levels less 
than or equal to 10 ug/100 cm2 PCBs, the equipment is released for 
unrestricted use.  If samples indicate greater levels of PCBs, cleaning as 
described above must be repeated with follow-up verification sampling.

In a medical emergency, knowing what to do can make all the difference.
Here are some tips to help you handle an unexpected injury or illness:
* In the event of decapitation, sit the victim's body in a chair
as best you can, balance the head on top of the shoulders, and walk away
whistling nonchalantly.
* Always keep plenty of gauze around the house in case you invent
an invisibility potion.
* If you did all you could and the victim still dies, pat him or
her down for a Snickers bar. It's not like you don't deserve one.
* Nothing revives a stroke victim like an eye-popping orgasm.
* If someone you know is seriously injured, cradle his or her head
in your lap and scream, ""Why?""
* Administering CPR is easy. Just do it like you saw them do on TV
that one time.
* In the event of accidental drug overdose, call Lou Reed
immediately.
* To stop a nosebleed, apply pressure. To start a nosebleed, apply
even greater pressure in short, repeated bursts.
* If a person requires artificial respiration, and you are of the
same sex as the person, and no one of the opposite sex is around to
perform the procedure, you are gay.
* If the Heimlich maneuver is ineffective on a choking victim,
grab his or her neck and squeeze downward to force the food into the
stomach. If this fails, grab the victim's ankles and swing him or her
around in a circle to force the food up.
* Make sure your first-aid kid contains a large, frilly Victorian
fan to revive fainting victims.
* If you are a hideous, disfigured hunchback and you see someone
who is injured and unconscious, treat the person. Then, as the person
begins to wake up, retreat into hiding. The person will always wonder
who saved him or her, and the experience will be poignant in a
bittersweet way.
* As a rule of thumb, always ask yourself this question: What
would Randolph Mantooth do?
* If possible, try to be the guy who tells the victim,
""Everything's going to be all right,"" while others do the actual work.

TOPAZ: NOVEMBER'S BIRTHSTONE
=============================
True topaz, symbol of love an affection, aid to sweetness of
disposition, and birthstone of November, is one of nature's
most wonderful and least-known gemstone families.  The true
topaz is rarely seen in jewelry stores.  Unfortunately, most
people know only the quartz (citrine) topaz.  In the past,
almost any yellow stone was called topaz.

Topaz occurs not only in the transparent yellow, yellow brown,
orangy brown, and pinky brown colors most popularly associated
with it, but also in light to medium red, light to medium
blue, very light green, violet and colorless.

Blue topaz has become very popular in recent years, although
most of it is treated and there is no way to determine which
is treated and which is natural.  Some of the deeper blue
treated topazes have been found to be radioactive and possibly
a health hazard.  In the United States, all blue topaz must be
tested for radiation levels.  However, be very careful when
buying blue topaz outside the United States, since it probably
has not been tested.


GIRDLE
===============
The girdle is the diamond's setting edge.  It needs to be just
thick enough to let the stone be set securely.  If it is too
thin, it is vulnerable to chipping;  too thick, and it can be
unattractive and difficult to set.  A thick girdle often creates
large, fuzzy gray reflections in the stone, especially if, as is
often the case, it accumulates dirt and grime.

On a step cut like an emerald, the girdle should be uniform in
thickness around the stone.  On a round, oval or cushion-shape
brilliant, it should undulate slightly between pairs of mains
and girdle facets and be thicker between the points of opposing
mains.  The girdle of a marquise, pear or heart is often slightly
thicker at the points to reduce the possibility of chipping.
Hearts have thicker girdles in their clefts.  Although slight
variations in girdle thickness are usually disregarded, sizable
variations can pose setting problems.

DIAMONDS AND GREASE
===================
If you wear a diamond, you probably have been surprised how
quickly a dirty film collects on the surface.  This is due
in large part to the fact that diamonds adhere to grease.  Put
your hands in dishwater and the grease quickly coats your
diamond.  The same thing happens with hand cream, body oils
and any other form of grease.

The fact that diamonds adhere to grease led to the invention of
the grease table in the late 1800s to separate diamonds for the
ore they are mined in.  The concentrate recovered from the
washing pans, pulsators, or heavy media separators is washed
over tables coated with thick grease.  The diamonds will adhere
to the table and then the resulting mixture is periodically
scraped off and melted down to remove the diamonds.

Today, the grease belt is more common.  Grease is automatically
applied at one end of a conveyor belt, the concentrates are
washed across it, and the resulting diamond-studded grease is
scraped off at the other end.

The amount of blueground (diamond ore)which has to be processed
is enormous.  Although figures differ for each mine, it takes
about 250 tons of blueground to produce a single one-carat
polished stone.


NATURAL
===========
A natural may not be a fault.  It's actually a piece of the
natural surface of the diamond crystal.  In cutting, a cutter
may decide to leave part of the ""natural"" rough surface in
order to get as large a diamond as possible from the rough
stone.  If this natural is no thicker than the thickness of the
girdle and does not distort the circumference of the stone,
most dealers consider it a minor defect at worst; if it extends
into the crown or pavilion of the stone, it is a serious fault.

Sometimes, if the natural is somewhat large but slightly below
the girdle, it will be polished off.  This produces an extra
facet.


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
===============
Name:  The Lesotho
Weight: 601.25 carats (rough)
Color: Brown

Lesotho is an isolated, landlocked mountain kingdom, poor
in natural resources and entirely surrounded by South
Africa. Lesotho was considered too remote to allow
profitable diamond mining.  In 1960, when the government
opened 30-square-foot claims, there was no shortage of
local prospectors seeking a big strike.  On May 26, 1967
Ernestine Ramaboa, working the claim she shared with her
husband Petrus, discovered a brown diamond of extraordinary
size.  The diamond, weighing 601.25 carats, caused a
sensation.  Eventually sold to Harry Winston who had the
diamond flown to New York and invited the Ramaboas as
his guests.

On March 5, 1968, on live TV, the stone was cleaved at
the precise point where nature left a crack in the
surface.  It was eventually cut into 18 polished stones
totaling 242.50 carats, the largest a 71.73 carat
emerald cut.

THE GREAT DIAMOND HUNT
=========================
Diamonds have been found in India for at least 3000 years.
For centuries, in fact, India was the world's only major
source, although there is no record of systematic mining
before about 1000 AD.  The Indian mines are no longer
significant producers.  Through the ages, however, new
sources are constantly discovered as older ones are depleted.

In the 1970s, gold miners in Brazil began finding shiny
pebbles which they tended to keep because they were beautiful.
Most had no idea of what they were worth, and better-informed
prospectors bought them for pocket change.

Over a hundred years later, diamonds were discovered in South
Africa, where the first alluvial (water carried)finds let
prospectors to the kimberlite pipes which had originally
brought these treasures to the surface.  This in tern led to
greater understanding of the geology of diamonds, and
transformed prospecting from a haphazard venture into a
scientific enterprise.

Today, diamonds have been found on every continent, although
not everywhere in commercially viable quantities and
qualities.  It is becoming clear that diamonds are much more
widely distributed over the entire globe than people once
thought.  Prospecting technology is also increasingly
sophisticated-the independent prospector with his shovel and
pan is being replaced by electromagnetic mapping techniques
and helicopter-mounted infrared cameras.

As a result, three out of five of today's major sources have
been discovered in the last quarter-century.  There is no
likelihood of running out of gem quality diamonds in the
foreseeable future.


ROUNDNESS
=============
A round diamond is not perfectly round and its roundness will
affect value.  The measurements of a round diamond include the
highest diameter, the lowest diameter and the depth.
Recognizing the rarity of truly round diamonds, some deviation
is permitted, and the stone will not be considered ""out-of-
round"" unless it deviates by more than the established norm-
approximately 0.10 millimeter (one-tenth of a millimeter) in
a one-carat stone.  In other words, the difference between the
two diameters should be less than 0.10 millimeters for a one
carat diamond, 0.12 millimeters for a two carat and 0.14
millimeters for a three carat.


AGS INTRODUCES LASER INSCRIPTIONS
=================================
The American Gem Society lab is now offering a laser
inscription service-similar to that offered by many of its
competitors-that ""writes"" on a stone's girdle.  The new
system an inscribe any type of gemstone, including colored
gemstones and can be used to inscribe words and/or logos,
and is experimenting with bar codes.

The AGS has become the premier grading laboratory for round
exceptionally well-cut diamonds.  When wholesalers buy stones
that have great cut they send them to the AGS for grading
even if they have been previously graded at another lab.  The
wholesalers hope to attain the AGS Ideal cut grade which means
the diamonds has Ideal polish, Ideal symmetry and Ideal
proportions.  These AGS Ideal cut diamonds are priced at a
premium but are in high demand by customers who want the best
of the best.


DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS

suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Today, the FERC  issued an order rejecting NYISO's request to lift the 
$2.52/MW bid cap on its  non-synchronized reserve market and ordered that a 
technical conference be  convened to find solutions to the problems in the 
non-synchronized reserve  market and also the energy market and its design 
flaws (as requested by  EPMI).? The Commission rejected NYISO's request 
because of its failure to  implement changes in the non-synchronized reserve 
market ordered by the  Commission and because the changes that were made do 
not significantly reduce  concentration of that market east of the central 
east constraint, but said that  it would lift the caps once the market could 
be demonstrated to be workably  competitive.
?
Commissioner Hebert  disented, in favor of lifting the bid caps as well as 
the $1000 cap on the  energy market.? He continues to support modifications 
to NYISO's markets  that would allow other suppliers to participate.? Hebert 
feels that a  technical conference would be ineffectual.
?
Commissioners  Breathitt and Massey supported the order.? Chairman Hoecker 
expressed a  long list of apprehensions about the markets and the process in 
New York,  likening his concerns to those expressed recently by the 
Commission regarding  California.? He?cited the staff report on its 
investigation of the  northeast bulk power markets, finding problems with the 
balkanization of the  markets and supporting the formation of a single 
Northeast regional  operation.

to issue the permit to. I contacted Ester this afternoon to discuss these

1/17/00 and a complete date of 2/17/00. Ester indicated that the permit can 
be reissued with different dates if necessary. Ester also indicated that I 
should contact Thurman ""TJ"" Robinson with the BIA Laguna Office regarding 
NEPA documentation. I contacted TJ and he said that he has submitted the 
paperwork for a ""categorical exclusion"" for the additional wells. TJ said 
that this was submitted to the BIA office in Albuquerque and that we could

s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

excelr WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming excelr Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
excelr=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

excelr Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include excelr=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) excelr Global Assets.  In addition, excelr=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of excelr Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of excelr Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of excelr APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of excelr Global Assets. excelr Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of excelr=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of excelr APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of excelr India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
excelr=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into excelr Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of excelr Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of excelr Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

excelr Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of excelr Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

excelr Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to excelr Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating excelr=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, excelr Americas.  excelr Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for excelr=20
Americas.

excelr Europe
The excelr Europe organization, which includes excelr=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and excelr Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

excelr Global Markets
excelr Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for excelr=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
excelr Global Assets.  excelr Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

excelr Industrial Markets
excelr Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of excelr Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other excelr businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
excelr Net Works, and excelr Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for excelr Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for excelr Global Markets and excelr Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for excelr Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

excelr GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND excelr WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by excelr=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across excelr=01,s businesses a=

the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20

Attached below is the Excel-based VaR Calculator that allows VaR calculations 
for up to 5 different curves and/or products. The results may be different 
that those generated in the ""official"" VaR model, because it does not reflect 
all the intricacies. We have developed an Ad-hoc VaR model that allows quick 
calculations of VaR for a potential transaction, as well as the incremental 
VaR on a given portfolio (using the ""official"" VaR model). We will make this 
tool available to you via http://rac.excelr.com/ in the near future (pending 
IT implementation).

44847,campbell-l/all_documents/853.,<13922076.1075857846698.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Dear Datek Online Customer,

The equity in your account has fallen below margin maintenance
requirements, creating a Margin Maintenance Call (or ""House Call"") as of
November 8, 2000.

Amount Due: The house call is for $ 1836

Date Due: This call is due by the close of business on Monday, November
13, which will be Day 3 of the house call.

Please be aware that Friday, November 10, 2000 is a bank holiday.  Banks
will not be open to wire transfer funds.  If you plan on funding your
account to meet your margin call, please wire funds to Datek Online
prior to Friday.  Once you have wired your funds remember to have your
bank provide you with a wire receipt containing a federal reference
number.

Datek Online only accepts a faxed copy of the wire receipt including the
federal reference number as proof of funds forthcoming.  Please fax your
wire receipt to 732-744-9143.

If you choose to overnight a check to Datek Online, please confirm with
the carrier that they will be delivering on Friday.  U.S. Post Offices
will not open and will not be delivering mail on Friday November 10,
2000.

The call requirements can be satisfied by:

1.  Depositing sufficient funds into your account to satisfy the entire
amount of the call.
2.  Selling sufficient securities in your account to satisfy the entire
amount of the call.
3.  The market value of your portfolio appreciating above equity
requirements.

What you should do:

A margin call requires you keep a watchful eye on the value of your
portfolio.  Be mindful of market fluctuations in your portfolio and how
they affect your account.  A margin call is payable on demand, and
rapidly depreciating market conditions may require immediate action
involving liquidation of sufficient securities in your account to
satisfy the call without further notice from us to you.  Taking the
necessary steps to satisfy the house call can avoid this.

This margin call must be satisfied by the close of the market on Monday,
November 13.  You should immediately decide which call payment method is
best for you.  Do not delay in satisfying the call.  Please take
immediate action to satisfy this call prior to the close of the market
on Monday, November 13, 2000-DAY 3. If your account does not meet margin
equity requirements as of the market open on November 14-DAY 4 we will
be forced to take action to satisfy the call by selling some or all of
your portfolio.

Sending Additional Funds to Meet Your Margin Call

The amount stated above is the amount of the call that may be met by
depositing additional funds (cash) into your account.   The fastest way
to deposit funds is to send a wire.

If you choose to wire funds you must:

1.   Fax a copy of the wire receipt
2.   Include the federal reference number of the wire
3.   Fax to 732-744-9143

Important Note
Datek Online only accepts a faxed copy of the wire receipt including the
federal reference number as proof of funds forthcoming.


If you choose to send a check by overnight mail you must:

1.   Include your UserName and account number on your check
2.   Mail to:
Datek Online
Attn: Cashiering Department - Margin Call
100 Wood Avenue South
Iselin, NJ 08830-2716

Important Notes:

? We do not accept an air bill number, a copy of a check or phone or
email confirmations as proof of funds forthcoming.
? We must receive and credit funds sent by overnight check by the close
of business on Day 3 for your margin call to be met.

<http://www.datek.com/helpdesk/deposits.html>

Liquidating Positions to Meet Your Margin Call

In order to liquidate enough stock to meet the initial amount of your
margin call you must do the following:

1.   Determine the margin requirement for the position you wish to
liquidate.   Stocks with special margin requirements can be found on our
HelpDesk under ""Your Portfolio"" and ""Margin Maintenance"" or by using the
following link:

http://www.datek.com/helpdesk/margin.html

2.   Divide the amount of the margin call by the margin requirement for
the position you wish to liquidate.  This is equal to the dollar amount
of the security you must sell to meet the initial amount of the margin
call.

Example:

The amount of the margin call is $1500.  To determine the dollar amount
of a security you must sell to meet this margin call divide $1500 by the
margin requirement for the stock you wish to liquidate.  If the margin
requirement is 30% (.30) you must sell $5000 worth of the
position.  If the margin requirement is 40% (.40) you must sell $3750
worth of the stock.

Your Call Could be Satisfied Through Market Fluctuation

Margin calls are calculated after the close of business on a daily basis
using the closing prices for each day.  In order for you to meet your
margin call through market fluctuation your account must close the
traditional trading day above the minimum margin maintenance
requirements.  This must be done by the close of November 13-Day 3 in
order for the call to end.  Intra-day market fluctuation will not
suffice in meeting your margin call.

Please do not assume your call will be satisfied because stocks in your
portfolio are ""bound to go up"". All stocks are subject to market
volatility. There are no guarantees that a stock price will rise or
assurances that a stock will not decline. Furthermore, your stocks could
decline further, creating an even larger margin call. Once again, do not
""bank"" on market fluctuation. Consider all factors, including your risk
tolerance, to take a realistic view of how to handle the margin call.


Account Equity and Additional House Calls

Depending on the securities you are holding in your portfolio and their
market fluctuations, additional funds may be due or actions that are
separate from this margin call may be required.  This may result in a
second house call.  The key is to understand the equity requirements and
ensure that your account is meeting them.  We may request additional
margin maintenance due to:

? A further decline in the market value of your positions.  At that time
you may meet a margin call only to be issued a second one because the
equity in the account has declined below a point where the initial
margin call no longer brings the account to the acceptable equity level.
In these instances, meeting the initial call may give you additional
time to meet the second call but the account must be returned to the
required equity ratio.
? Any undue concentration of one security in your account.

Needless to say, selling out an account is something we don't like to do
at Datek Online.  We want you to be aware of the status of your margin
account at all times, and be prepared to take action as soon as
conditions warrant.  Be fully aware that if at any time your account
value falls to approximately 10% equity, or if market conditions
warrant, we reserve the right to close out some or all of your positions
with or without notice, at our sole discretion.  You should review our
HelpDesk to check equity requirements.

Subject: PCB Decontamination of Turbine

Lou - 

Under the PCB Mega rule, self-implementing decontamination of PCBs (i.e., 
cleanup without verification sampling) is only available for PCB containers; 
movable equipment used in storage areas, tools and sampling equipment; non 
porous surfaces contaminated with mineral oil dielectric fluid; and air 
compressor systems.  40 CFR 761.79(c).  EPA has yet to provide written 
guidance on its PCB Mega Rule decontamination regulations.  Based on my 
reading of the regulations, a contaminated turbine must be decontaminated in 
accordance with the measurement-based decontamination methods.

The measurement-based decontamination procedures are not prescriptive.  The 
simply require that the non porous surface be cleaned by a method that 
reduces the surface concentration to less than or equal to 10 micrograms PCBs 
per 100 square centimeters if the equipment is decontaminated for 
unrestricted use or less than 100 micrograms PCBs per 100 square centimeters 
if the material is to be disposed of in an industrial smelter after 
decontamination. 40 CFR 761.79(b).   I assume that the most efficient method 
of ""cleaning"" a turbine would be to drain the turbine of all free flowing 
liquids and then wipe or soak all surfaces that were exposed to PCBs with or 
in solvent.

If a solvent is used to clean the surfaces, the regulations require that it 
have a solubility of PCBs of 5% or more by weight (other parts of the 
regulations recommend Kerosene, diesel fuel, terpene hydrocarbons and a 
mixture of terpene hydrocarbons and terpene alcohols).  The solvent can 
continued to be used until it reaches a concentration of 50 ppm PCBs.  40 CFR 
761.79(d).

Once the surfaces have been wiped clean with the solvent, verification 
sampling can be done using the standard wipe test at locations on the turbine 
selected under Subpart P (which includes the sampling of small and irregular 
shaped surfaces).  If the measurements show the surfaces have been cleaned to 
< 10 ug/100 cm2, the equipment is available for unrestricted use.  40 CFR 
761.79(b)(3)(1)(i)(A).

Persons participating in the decontamination activities must use protective 
clothing or equipment to protect against dermal contact of inhalation of PCBs 
or materials containing PCBs and take precautions not to release PCBs into 
the environment from the decontamination area.  40 CFR 761.79(e).

Written records of the sampling procedure used to verify that the equipment 
has been decontaminated and sampling results must be maintained for 3 years.  
The regulations do not require that a written record of the procedure used to 
decontaminate the material be generated or maintained.  40 CFR 761.79(f).

Decontamination wastes and residues that are generated by rinsing or soaking 
contaminated surfaces with solvent can be disposed of at their existing 
concentration, which means that hydrocarbon solvents used which contain <50 
ppm PCBs can be marketed as used oil.  40 CFR 761.79(g).

The non-liquid cleaning materials (e.g., rags) and personal protective 
equipment, regardless of concentration, can be disposed of at a municipal 
landfill, a industrial non hazardous waste facility, a RCRA subtitle C 
facility permitted to accept PCBs or a TSCA PCB disposal facility.  40 CFR 
761.79(g)(6).

Finally, notification to the EPA is not required.  Verification sampling 
procedures and analysis must be available for EPA review when requested.  40 
CFR 761.79(f).

A very simple procedure would be:

1.  All persons participating in the decontamination activity must wear 
personal protective equipment that protects from skin exposure that prevents 
inhalation of PCBs. 

2.  Drain turbine of all free flowing liquids.

3.  Wipe all surfaces or parts the would or could have been in contact with 
liquids with rags soaked in clean, unused solvent such as Kerosene.  

4.  Collect all personal protective equipment and rags used during the 
decontamination process in drums for disposal.

5.  Collect all used solvent and appropriate containers (Drums?).  Collect 
sample of solvent and have it tested to determine disposal options.

6.  Sampling cleaned equipment by collecting wipe samples at locations 
determined under Subpart P of the regulations.

7.  If verification samples indicate equipment is contaminated at levels less 
than or equal to 10 ug/100 cm2 PCBs, the equipment is released for 
unrestricted use.  If samples indicate greater levels of PCBs, cleaning as 
described above must be repeated with follow-up verification sampling.

Call me after you have had a chance to look at this.

Sue

Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

To All Parties in FERC Docket No. RP00-476

Subject:  Proposals for Southern's Order No. 637 Meeting

On August 15, 2000, Southern filed proposed changes to its services in
Docket No. RP00-476 in response to the requirements of FERC Order No 637.
As a result of customer comments on its filing, Southern posted a notice of
a meeting with parties that intervened in this proceeding to be held as

Date:  Thursday, November 16, 2000
Time:  10:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.  (Eastern Time)
Location:  Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Executive
Conference Center, Airport Atrium, Suite 300 (see directions below)

We have a few spaces left at the meeting. To RSVP, please call Ms. Lane
Fletcher at 205-325-7109.

Our goal for this meeting is to gain a common understanding of all the
proposals and to reach consensus solutions on the issues that have been
raised. To facilitate discussion and resolution at the meeting, Southern
provides the following summary of customer comments it received and
additional changes Southern is willing to make in the context of a
settlement of all issues.  If you have any questions about these proposals,

FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS ONLY

Summary of Customer Comments and Southern's Responsive Proposals
Docket No. RP00-476

I.  OFOs AND PENALTIES

Comment 1:  Provide objective criteria for issuing and lifting OFOs
including information that will help customers better understand operational
situation being addressed

Response:  SNG does or will post warnings and forecasts in advance
of OFOs and will work with customers to clarify tariff language on a
mutually agreeable basis

Comment 2:  A $15.00 penalty for Type 3 Alert Mode OFO is not reasonable;
$7.50 is more reasonable

Response:  In the spirit of compromise, SNG would be willing to
decrease the penalty to $10.00 per dth as part of a settlement package.

Comment 3:  The short notice and harsh penalty of the Type 3 Emergency Mode
OFO is unreasonable for the following reasons:
- Customers need more time to make adjustments
o Only implement if a Type 3 Critical Mode OFO
is already in place
o 12 hours notice would be more appropriate
- Limit application to abusive shipper behavior
- Clarify tariff that penalty only applies at start of gas day
and not intraday
- Shorter notice is not justified because if implemented too
late, a firm shipper cannot bump IT on last nomination cycle
- Justify adding the gas price to the penalty
- The increased penalty price is really an increase in
imbalance charges without other benefits
- Use Gas Daily's ""Midpoint Louisiana - Onshore South"" daily
index price instead of the one proposed

Response:  As part of a settlement package, SNG is willing to make
the following changes to its Type 3 Emergency Mode OFO.
- Type 3 Emergency Mode OFO can be implemented at the start of
the gas day on (i) 20 hours prior notice, or (ii) 4 hours prior notice ONLY
if a Type 3 Alert or Critical Mode OFO is in effect for the previous day;
telephone notice will be given when the penalty is upgraded to Emergency.
- Language limiting the application of each OFO is set forth
in Section 41 of the tariff's general terms and conditions.  SNG is willing
to repeat this language in this specific OFO section of the tariff, however,
so that customers feel comfortable that implementation of this penalty will
be targeted to the operational problem areas on the system or specific
offenders whenever possible.
- SNG will clarify that penalties only apply at the start of a
gas day and can be cancelled during a gas day if not needed due to a change
in conditions.
- Since advance notice must always be given prior to the start
of a gas day (9:00 a.m. CCT), shippers can adjust nominations on the
Intraday 1 nomination cycle (10:00 a.m. CCT) and bump IT.
- At the meeting, SNG will further discuss the reasons its
penalties (including the higher penalty for Type 3 Emergency Mode) are
needed to preserve the operational integrity of the system.

Comment 4:   The change to Type 5 OFOs could result in a shipper in a group
being penalized even if it is within tolerance at a point

Response:  At the meeting, SNG will review an example of how the
proposed changes to the Type 5 OFO will actually avoid shipper-specific
penalties at a point when the point or group of receipt points is within
tolerance.  This provision will only help, never hurt, a shipper.


II.  SEGMENTATION

Comment 1:  SNG currently allows firm shippers to segment their capacity by
rate zone.  It should be operationally feasible to provide more
segmentation, especially along Southern's two main trunklines.

Response:  SNG has reviewed its operational model and has isolated
two ""long line"" segments of its pipeline along which it could allow
intrazone segmentation in an operationally feasible manner.  At the meeting,
SNG will review the physical attributes of its system that led to this
model.  To be able to provide this level of intrazone segmentation, the
program would have the following attributes:
- SNG will retain its existing segmentation program, but will
layer on top of that the ability for a shipper to fully segment along
identified long line segments of its north or south system up to the firm
capacity that the customer has on the long line being segmented.  For
example, if a customer has north system capacity into zone 2, it can do
intrazone segmentation along the long line portion of the north system
through zone 2 up to its contract quantity on the north system.
- On the long line on which the shipper has firm capacity, the
shipper can nominate to primary or secondary delivery points so long as the
nominations do not overlap along the long line segment.
- The shipper will have to path its receipts and deliveries
for the portion of its nomination where it wishes to do intrazone segments.
This allows SNG to verify that segments do not overlap.  The first delivery
point being segmented can be served by an upstream supply pool or storage,
but all downstream segments must be served by physical receipt-to-delivery
combinations.
- Allocated receipts serving an intrazone segmented delivery
would have to meet or exceed the segmented delivery to avoid overlapping
segments and qualify for the FT commodity rate.
- SNG is in the process of determining the programming
requirements to add this new, more complex model and will provide an
estimate at the meeting.

III.  CAPACITY RELEASE AND SCHEDULING EQUALITY

Comment 1:  SNG should allow customers to offer and bid on capacity release
deals before each of the four nomination cycles.  (In its filing, Southern
has offered to enhance its capacity release procedures to allow prearranged,
non-biddable deals to be awarded prior to each nomination cycle, but keep
biddable deals awarded according to the GISB standards prior to the Timely
Nomination Cycle.)

Response:  While Southern is not required to offer these additional
options under Order No. 637, it would be willing, as part of a settlement,
to add an offer/bid capacity release opportunity prior to the Evening
Nomination Cycle.  GISB is developing standards for intraday capacity
releases, and Southern proposes to wait until the standards are approved to
offer more flexibility due to the programming complexity.

Comment 2:  Changes that require programming should be implemented as soon
as possible if ready prior to the time estimated by SNG in its filing.

Response:  Southern will implement all changes as soon as the
programming is ready, and it will give 30 days advance notice of the
implementation date.

Comment 3:  Southern should allow releases of FT-NN service on a no-notice
basis as soon as possible.

Response:  As noted in its filing, Southern is in the process of
programming this functionality and proposes to implement it on March 1,
2001.  Southern plans to make its tariff filing in mid-January 2001, and
will host a conference call to discuss the tariff filing in early December
2000.

IV.  IMBALANCE MANAGEMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS

Comment 1:  Customers need more than 3 business days to elect to trade
imbalances because imbalances are not final at the time of the election
deadline.

Response:  Effective December 1, 2000, for November imbalances,
Southern has filed to implement the new GISB standard that gives customers
17 business days after the end of the month to elect to trade imbalances and
to complete the trades.

Comment 2:  Southern should allow customers to use other customers' CSS/ISS
storage accounts to resolve imbalances at the end of the month.

Response:  While Southern is concerned that this may increase the
level of imbalances, in an overall settlement, it would be willing to add
this option, subject to active confirmation by the other customer whose
storage account is used to resolve the imbalance.

Comment 3:  Imbalances and overrun penalties should be based on the lesser
of operational or actual data.

Response:  Southern calculates both an estimated imbalance
percentage (on the last day of the month) and an actual imbalance percentage
and uses the lesser of the two percentages when cashing out imbalances.  On
the overrun comment, Southern bills all volumes actually metered, but fills
up a customer's firm transportation service within a zone prior to billing
IT overrun.

Comment 4:  Cash out revenues in excess of the index prices, less expenses
incurred by SNG for cash out gas, should be credited to the SCRM account.

Response:  Southern does credit all revenues received for cash out
and will provide an overview of the items that affect the SCRM account at
the meeting.

Comment 5:  Southern received comments in support of and in opposition to
the collection of injection or withdrawal fees on the net imbalance resolved
with storage at the end of the month.  It was suggested that Southern should
go further and collect the fee on the daily (instead of net) imbalance
resolved through storage.

Response:  Southern believes that its proposal is reasonable and
equitable for the reasons given in its filing.

Comment 6:  Southern should be required to honor discounts to alternate
delivery points within the capacity path of the point receiving the
discount.

Response:  Generally, FT reservation charge discounts continue to
apply even when alternate delivery points are nominated.  Any limitations on
the applicability of the discount to specific points will be agreed to as
part of the discount and will be set out in the discount exhibit.

Subject: FERC Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems


On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  excelr's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which excelr has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit."")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively"" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

The reports are attached below.

Subject: PCB Cleanup Under the Mega Rule

Lou - 

Attached is a revised version of the bulleted document I created addressing 
characterization and cleanup of PCB contaminated concrete.  I revised the 
document to include contaminated soils (i.e., bulk remediation waste) and 
additional information about cleanup levels.

Generally - My understanding of the rules is that EPA requires cleanup to 100 
ppm in low occupancy areas if the contaminated area is capped and deed 
recorded.  Disposal in place of PCBs at concentrations higher than 100 ppm 
requires written EPA approval.

Since it's been a month since we emailed you our list of recommendations, we 
wanted to check back with you and see if there is anything we can do to help 
you with your diamond buying decision? Our goal is to help you make an 
informed decision that you will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, 
since we don't own these stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants 
who will work to find the very best diamond for you at a great price.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

On November 15, 2000, the New York Independent System Operator,
Inc. filed a reformatted version of the NYISO Open Access Transmission
Tariff (OATT).  The new version is entitled New York Independent System
Operator, Inc.,  FERC Electric Tariff,  Original Volume No. 1.

This filing was made to comply with the FERC's Order No. 614, issued
March 31, 2000 in Docket No. RM99-12-000, 99 FERC   61,352 (2000).
Order 614 amended the FERC's regulations concerning the designation
of electric rate schedule sheets. This order changed the titles and
other administrative information to be shown at the top and bottom of
each tariff sheet, thus necessitating that the NYISO modify the information
included on the NYISO's tariff sheets.

The tariff filed on November 15, 2000 does not include any change in
the content of the tariff.  It does include the administrative changes
described above and a repagination and reformatting to facilitate
existing and future changes.  This tariff includes all tariff modifications
that were filed before September 1, 2000, and have been approved by the
FERC.  The tariff does not reflect filings made on or after September 1, 2000.
The tariff also does not reflect the NYISO's February 11, 2000 compliance
filing in Docket No. ER97-1523-029, which still awaits Commission action.

Once this tariff has been approved by the FERC, the NYISO will create and
post a consolidated version of the OATT that shows all approved and
proposed changes.  This new consolidated version will be comparable to
and replace the current consolidated OATT posted on the NYISO website.

The November 15, 2000 filing can be found on the NYISO website at:

Welcome to edition 3.7 of Investors Insite--an editorial 
co-production of Datek Online and The Motley Fool. 

The long-awaited news in this edition is Datek Online's introduction 
of option trades for qualified customers. Backed by an easy-to-grasp 
online trading system and real-time option price chains, Datek 
Online's commission is $9.99 per online option trade plus $1.75 per 
contract. Compare that price to the commissions charged by other 
brokerages. If you've decided that options may be an appropriate part 
of reaching your financial goals, apply now to trade options at 
Datek Online.* 

Wonder how quickly stock markets are making the move to fully 
decimalized trading? Links to an Insite follow-up article identifies 
the more than 100 stocks listed on the New York and American Stock 
Exchanges that became eligible for decimalized trading on September 
25, 2000. Qualified investors can now make decimalized equity and 
option trades of these stocks at Datek Online. 

A provocative article from Motley Fool shows how a Bear Market might 
just be the ticket to that level playing field you've been dreaming 
of. Want to learn about books that some people actually have time to 
read? Check out the Motley Fool's reviews of Peter Bernstein's 
Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk and Robert Shiller's 
Irrational Exuberance. And if you've got the urge to dust off your 
thinking cap, this month's installment of Motley Trivia offers three 
tough-but-fair corporate ID challenges. 

And be sure to check out the next generation of Streamerc. A free
download from Datek Online can put the newly expanded capabilities of 
this real-time quote system right on your desktop.

ARE BEAR MARKETS GREAT NEWS? 
Most people don't think so. But the pros at Motley Fool point out 
that a bearish dip in prices can make stocks more affordable for the 
average investor. If you missed the boat on the bulls, or want to go 
back for affordable seconds then, ironically enough, a downturn in 
your future might be something to cheer about. more>>

turbines which have undergone power  unit changouts, the following 
recordkeeping and monitoring conditions apply:

1) DAILY recordkeeping of nitrogen and sulfur must be taken of the fuel gas 
which supplies the applicable turbine(s). 

2) This recordkeeping consists of electronic recording (gas chromtograph for 
nitrogen and  delmar or equivelant for sulfur) or stain tubes may also be 
used  for sulfur. These DAILY records include measurements on Saturdays and 
Sundays.

3) The measurement must be taken at the location.  An exception to this is 
that the nitrogen and sulfur measurements may be taken upstream or 
downstream  of the applicable turbine facility provided that there are no 
natural gas deliveries into the pipe which would interfere or dilute/increase 
the measurements  for the applicable turbine fuel gas. 

4) Fuel gas records in hard copy form or equivalent  for  the nitrogen and 
sulfur must be maintained at the facility or at a central location for easy 
retrival.  

5) A turbine facility may waiver out of this nitorgen and sulfur daily 
recordkeeping requirement by obtaining a custom fuel monitoring schedule 
(CFMS) from  the EPA.  Approval of a  CFMS allows a greatly reduced 
recordkeeping and reporting for nitrogen and sulfur.  CFMS requests have been 
submitted for the  following facilities:

   P-1 C/S
   Plains Turbine C/S
   Atoka No 2 C/S
   Monument C/S
   Crawford C/S
   Bloomfield C/S
 
Approvals have not as yet been obtained.  Until issuance of a CFMS, an 
applicable facility is required to continue daily sampling for nitrogen and 
sulfur.   
 
Facilities which have received CFMS from the EPA include:

   La Plata C/S
   P-2 C/S

Please be advised that there may be certain reporting requirements that might 
be required for each CFMS.  I would strongly advise that the La Plata and 
Panhandle  teams review their CFMS and include reporting dates into MCS, so 
that the deadlines and reportings are not missed. 

If you have a turbine facility which is subject to the nitrogen and sulfur 
reporting requirements and would like to reduce the reporting burden, contact 
Butch or myself.

Subject: Re: NSPS Calculation for Saturn 1200 -Reply

Rick,
Attached is communications I have had with Solar on the Saturn turbine fuel 
consumption.  The fuel rate Ms Leslie Whitherspoon cites in her example below 
is the lowest I have seen from Solar for a Saturn turbine.  I do not know for 
a fact whether her example is applicable to our operation.  

I am making you aware that any of the calculations using Solar's data has 
exceeded the 10.7 gigajoule/hr limit as specified in 40 CFR 60.330 clause of 
the BNA's Subpart GG - Standards of Performance for Stationary Gas Turbines.

I was incorrect to say exceeding this fuel consumption would trigger PSD; per 
our conversation it only triggers a NSPS permit which occordingly is 
triggered anyway with the replacement of a Saturn turbine.  Attached is the 
spreadsheet I forwarded to Ms Whitherspoon.

In the NSPS formula the ""STD"" value is % by volume....

Therefore, you take your result, 0.015 % ppmv, and move the
decimal two places to the left to represent ppmv.  Result 0.00015
or 150 ppm.

Yes, the Saturn has a heat input high enough to trigger the NSPS
regulation.  This regulation however, has nothing to do with
triggering PSD.  I don't understand the connection you are
making between NSPS, Subpart GG and PSD.  Most states,
including Kansas, have the delegated authority for NSPS.

All that is required by the standard is a performance test within
180 days of start-up and a record of the sulfur and nitrogen
content of the fuel.  In some cases, less testing is required.

Please let me know if this doesn't answer your questions.  I feel
that there may be some disconnect on what your strategy and
how I'm assisting.

Leslie,
Please review your calculations.  I do not think  (14.4  /  14.4  x
0.015)
equals 150ppm.

This issue is not the tolerable limits of emission of the Solar
Saturn.  I feel
this issue relates to a fuel flow limit which governs whether a
Saturn falls
under the 10.7 gigajoule limit prescibe by 40 CFR 60.330 clause
of the BNA's
Subpart GG - Standards of Performance for Stationary Gas
Turbines.  I have
included a spreadsheet to illustrate my point.  From your data a
Solar Saturn
consumes fuel at the rate of 10,864 BTU/HP.hr; my calculations
show that this
rate consumes fuel a rate about .5 gigajoule above BNAs limit,
which may force
us to apply for a PSD permit.

Please take time to review the spreadsheet and my comments,
and if you see
anything that needs correction, please advise.

(See attached file: Solar Saturn limits.xls)

Subject:  NSPS Calculation for Saturn 1200





Heat Rate at ISO conditions:  10,864 Btu/Hp-hr

10,864 Btu/Hp-hr  x  1055 J/Btu  /  745.7 w/Hp  /  1000 J/KJ =
15.37 KJ/w-hr

Max denominator is 14.4 per the regulation

14.4  /  14.4  x  0.015   =  150  ppm

The regulatory limit is 150 ppm.  We warranty the Saturn 1500 at
110 ppm.  I would suppose that the 1200 had a similar warranty.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Do you see any benefit for some of us (maybe Mike Terraso, Larry Campbell and

your staff on PCBs.  We could provide some general information and well as 
Transwestern specific information/history that might make your group better

the Pueblo of Laguna, Division of Environment. I contacted Ms. Bernacik at

environmental issues at the Station. 

In a conversation with Norm the previous week, Norm indicated to me that he 
had met with Ms. Bernacik and Ray Lucero (Engineer, Pueblo of Laguna) 
recently in regards to backfilling an open excavation which had been 
excavated in 1993 when a diesel UST was removed from the site. The excavation 
had not been backfilled pending authorization from the Pueblo of Laguna. This 
and other outstanding issues were discussed in a meeting with Ray Lucero, the 
Governor of the Pueblo of Laguna, Ted Ryther, Larry Campbell, Butch Russell, 
and myself back in 1995 but there was no resolution of the issues, primarily 
because at the time the Laguna's did not have an environmental staff person 
to address such issues. Subsequently, Ms. Bernacik was hired as the Laguna's 
environmental staff person about two years ago. 

In the course of Norm's conversation with Ms. Bernacik and Mr. Lucero, Mr. 
Lucero indicated some concern that the Pueblo of Laguna had not been kept 
apprised of environmental issues at the Station. In light of this, I have 
prepared a ""Report of Groundwater Monitoring Activities"". This report covers 
monitoring activities between June 1994 and June 1999. As previously 
mentioned, I also contacted Ms. Bernacik for the purpose of introducing 
myself and to inform her that a report has been prepared and will be 
delivered to her office. I also suggested that we meet at the site to discuss 
outstanding environmental issues. The response from Ms. Bernacik was very 
favorable and we agreed to meet at the site at 10:00 am November 16th. Ms. 
Bernacik also indicated that someone from the BIA will be with her.",Non Abusive

the pueblo of Laguna to Transwestern's environmental activities at the 
facility.  The Laguna's have hired an environmental person to oversee 
environmental issues on pueblo lands.  The meeting centered around three 
issues:  a UST site which had been removed, but not formally closed, a 
historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the 
late 1980's, and the ongoing groundwater remediation at  the site.  

Transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why 
these issues were unresolved in the ""eyes"" of the Laguna.  Transwestern 
committed to submitting closure requests for the UST and asbestos issues.  
With repsect to the groundwater issue, a presentation was given enlighting 
the Laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology 
and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants 
(chlorinated solvents and PCB's) and Transwestern's intent to continue its 
remediation efforts. Transwestern assured the Laguna environmental 
representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental 
issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency.   At the conclusion of the 
meeting, the Laguna's understood Transwestern's commitment to maintaining the 
policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of Laguna.

The meeting provided Transwestern and the Laguna's with the opportunity to 
meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships.  The

Norm:
Per our telephone discussion this afternoon, I suggest you go ahead and 
backfill what remains of the open excavation that was created when the diesel 
UST was removed. A closure report was submitted to Ms. Bernacik of the Laguna 
Pueblo Environmental Department in January. We have not received a formal 
response from the Pueblo yet, but in a phone conversation, Ms. Bernacik 
indicated that they would have to take a closer look at the report before 
making a decision. Regardless, I don't think we need to wait on an approval 
of the closure report before backfilling the excavation.

1.)  Ms. Bernacik indicated that the POEP has formed a Superfund division 
which is lead by a fellow named Mr. Rizvi. Mr. Rizvi had contacted Ms. 
Bernacik and requested the opportunity to be present at the site during the 
next semiannual sampling event. This event is tentatively scheduled for the 
week of June 19th. I am to notify Ms. Bernacik when we have set a firm date 
for sampling. 
2.)  Ms. Bernacik asked if we had received an extension to the off-site 
access permit from the Pueblo so that we could install the three additional 
wells. I indicated that I believe the extension was issued and Norm had 
picked it up but I wasn't certain. I followed-up with Norm and he has picked 
up the permit. Drilling activities are scheduled for the week of June 5th.
3.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about our request for no further action on the UST 
removal. Ms. Bernacik indicated that Norm Moreno at the POEP had responded to 
her with comments on the request and recommended against closing the issue. 
Ms. Bernacik said that she would send us a copy of Mr. Moreno's letter. At a 
minimum, the Pueblo will require continued monitoring. This does not change 
our monitoring plan since we had already proposed continued monitoring of the 
UST area wells as part of our facility wide groundwater monitoring program. 
However, Ms. Bernacik also indicated that the Pueblo may require one or two 
additional monitor wells in the former UST area.
4.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about backfilling the former UST excavation area. 
Ms. Bernacik indicated that her office had already issued an approval of TW's 
request to close the landfarm. I asked again about backfilling the excavation 
but was having difficulty communicating my interest was backfilling the 
excavation rather than closure of the landfarm. I reviewed the letter from 
Ms. Bernacik regarding closure of the landfarm and it does not specifically 
address backfilling the excavation. I believe that Ms. Bernacik is under the 
impression that her office has already approved backfilling the excavation,

with Ms. Bernacik at her office in order to better explain what we need.",Non Abusive

assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna

George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site

EPA.  During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or 
decision had been made by excelr management towards remediation assistance in 
the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.  I had informed her that we were 
still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future 
concerning management's decision.  I would appreciate it very much if each of 
you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done 
and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a 
proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure.

Subject: Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

Larry,
I contacted Norm Moreno at the POEP this afternoon. He said that he would 
contact Ed Steadman, Associate Director at the EERC, and pass along my name 
and number so that Ed could contact me. Norm said that he would prefer to do 
it this way rather than to have us initiate the first contact. The other day 
I found the web site for the research center (www.eerc.und.nodak.edu).

? the measured pH for all samples was in the range of 6.9 - 9.1; this is 
within the RCRA regulatory limits of 2.0 - 12.5.

Furthermore, the measured TPH for all samples was in the range of 131 - 9660 
mg/kg with an average TPH concentration of 2429 mg/kg.

Selected photos of the sampling effort are attached. There was a considerable 
amount of waste debris found in the pits, particulary at the east end of the 
larger pit area.

I will be finalizing the excavation plan for the former pit areas over the 
next week or so. I will prepare cost estimates for two alternative excavation 
plans; one for a dig and haul option and one for a combination of dig and 
haul for the most heavily affected soil and on-site blending for less 
affected soil. We should try to have a work plan to the NMOCD by the week of 
October 1st.

a simple modification.

We are set up to move the units to Midland next week, but I think we should 
strongly consider shipping the units back to Baker Furnace for these 
modifications. John indicated that they could turn them around in about two 
weeks. Allowing for shipping time, this would place the units back in Midland 
around June 20th (a more realistic date would be June 30th). A rough cost 
estimate is $18000 ($7000 per unit plus $4000 shipping). I believe this would 
save both time and cost compared to trying to do the modifications in 
Midland. We would also end up with ""good as new"" units. As a compromise

Thanks for completing the diamond information request form at 
http://www.DSOURCEVA.com

I did a preliminary search and found the following diamonds for you to 
consider.  There were many extremely nice diamonds at prices substantially 
below your budget so I have include a longer recommendation list than usual.  
This selection should help you determine what is the best value for you.

We filter out the 80 to 90% of diamonds that are cut poorly and only present 
to our customers diamonds that have great cut because we know that cut is the 
primary factor in a diamond's beauty, especially sparkle and fire.

With a round diamond, millimeter measurements are more important than the 
actual carat weight with regard to appearance. More carat weight does not 
necessarily mean more size.  For example, diamonds with depth percentages 
less than 60% will generally have a larger diameter, for the same carat 
weight, than those with depth percentages greater than 60% even though both 
diamonds could be ideal cut.  While we search for diamonds in the top cut 
classes, the preferred combination of depth and table percentages is a matter 
of personal taste and choice.  The three measurement numbers are the longest 
diameter, shortest diameter, and depth in millimeters.  The three letter 
codes after the measurement numbers are the Polish, Symmetry and Fluorescence 
ratings.

Prices in parenthesis are cash discount prices for wire transfers that are 3% 
reduction from credit card prices.  We need to check certification to assess 
specifications marked with ? below.

I've given you a little variety to consider because you need to decide on 
what your priorities are for the right diamond for you.

Which of these diamonds would you like us to order in for inspection?  If 
none of these is what you are looking for, what is it that you would like to 
see different?  The more feedback you can give us, the more effective we can 
be at finding the diamond of your dreams.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

These diamonds were available as of Monday and we have copies of the 
certifications that we can share with you via email at your request.  High 
quality, well cut diamonds like these do not stay on the market long.  If you 
are interested in one of these diamonds, please let us know quickly so we can 
request the wholesaler put it on hold for us.

If you are looking for a really spectacular mounting, check out our favorite 
manufacturer's online catalog at http://www.18karati.com where you can click 
on Catalog then click on Wedding Rings to see pictures of some of the best 
craftsmanship in the industry.  This is a manufacturer's web site so there 
are no prices listed.  If you see something you like, give us the item 
numbers and we will get price quotes that are a fraction of regular retail 
prices.  Our customers have been thrilled with the quality and beauty of 
these mountings so we can highly recommend them to you.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Thanks for completing the diamond information request form at 
http://www.DSOURCEVA.com

I did a preliminary search and found the following diamonds for you to 
consider.  There were many extremely nice diamonds at prices substantially 
below your budget so I have include a longer recommendation list than usual.  
This selection should help you determine what is the best value for you.

We filter out the 80 to 90% of diamonds that are cut poorly and only present 
to our customers diamonds that have great cut because we know that cut is the 
primary factor in a diamond's beauty, especially sparkle and fire.

With a round diamond, millimeter measurements are more important than the 
actual carat weight with regard to appearance. More carat weight does not 
necessarily mean more size.  For example, diamonds with depth percentages 
less than 60% will generally have a larger diameter, for the same carat 
weight, than those with depth percentages greater than 60% even though both 
diamonds could be ideal cut.  While we search for diamonds in the top cut 
classes, the preferred combination of depth and table percentages is a matter 
of personal taste and choice.  The three measurement numbers are the longest 
diameter, shortest diameter, and depth in millimeters.  The three letter 
codes after the measurement numbers are the Polish, Symmetry and Fluorescence 
ratings.

Prices in parenthesis are cash discount prices for wire transfers that are 3% 
reduction from credit card prices.  We need to check certification to assess 
specifications marked with ? below.

I've given you a little variety to consider because you need to decide on 
what your priorities are for the right diamond for you.

Which of these diamonds would you like us to order in for inspection?  If 
none of these is what you are looking for, what is it that you would like to 
see different?  The more feedback you can give us, the more effective we can 
be at finding the diamond of your dreams.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

These diamonds were available as of Monday and we have copies of the 
certifications that we can share with you via email at your request.  High 
quality, well cut diamonds like these do not stay on the market long.  If you 
are interested in one of these diamonds, please let us know quickly so we can 
request the wholesaler put it on hold for us.

If you are looking for a really spectacular mounting, check out our favorite 
manufacturer's online catalog at http://www.18karati.com where you can click 
on Catalog then click on Wedding Rings to see pictures of some of the best 
craftsmanship in the industry.  This is a manufacturer's web site so there 
are no prices listed.  If you see something you like, give us the item 
numbers and we will get price quotes that are a fraction of regular retail 
prices.  Our customers have been thrilled with the quality and beauty of 
these mountings so we can highly recommend them to you.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!",Non Abusive
45038,campbell-l/discussion_threads/10.,<6620549.1075851894458.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I spoke at length today with Rod Boschee at PG&E.  The main focus of our 
discussion was logistics/planning for the upcoming 4/13/99 meeting between TW 
and PG&E representatives.  Mr. Boschee, as in earlier conversations this 
week, did not mention the 3/25 sample results.  Rather, it was agreed (also 
mandated by his boss, Bill Mazotti) that the time was ripe for a follow-on 
meeting to our initial discussion in Topock back in January.  I provided 
verbal notification to Mr. Boschee that Transwestern had retained an outside 
contractor for purposes of a decontamination process to be accomplished 
tomorrow at our filter separators.  In addition to my verbal notification, I 
told him that TW would provide PG&E with a letter, just to complete the paper 
trail.  I reinforced the importance of communication between the companies, 
both formal and informal.  A copy of the letter I faxed to Mr. Boschee is 
attached below.


Mr. Boschee will be preparing a draft agenda for the 4/13 meeting for TW to 
consider.  In addition to TW providing an update on all interim as well as 
long term plans for the lateral, Mr. Boschee noted two important items.  
First, PG&E would like more information regarding the proposed controlled 
Selexol flush.  Their concern is that the Selexol was colored initially as 
the culprit in this PCB issue, and now is being considered a part of a 
revised interim solution.  Secondly, PG&E would like to discuss the upcoming 
filter change at its station currently scheduled for 4/29.  

We've decided to meet in Las Vegas on 4/13.  The choice of Vegas seemed to be 
more centralized (vs. San Francisco), as well as more convenient for those of 
us travelling all the way from Houston.  PG&E is planning on having the 
following personnel attend the meeting:
 Rod Boschee-  Director of Contract Development
 Dave Anderson-  Attorney
 Mel Wong-  Project Manager, Topock Lateral project
 Jody Garcia-  District Superintendent, Barstow Dist.
 Tony Estrada-  Environmental
 2 as-yet-to-be-named Barstow team members

Transwestern is planning on having the following personnel attend the meeting:
 Jeff Fawcett- Marketing
 Louis Soldano-  Attorney
 Mike Nelson-  VP Operations
 Rich Jolly-  District Ops
 Larry Campbell-  Environmental
 Bob Iversen-  Technical advisor, Selexol/PCB matters
 Earl Chanley-  Engineering

The plan is to take Bill's plane from Houston, pick-up Mike Nelson in 
Amarillo, meet in Vegas, and return (with drop-off in Amarillo) to Houston in 
one day.  I'm coordinating the logistics with Virginia O'Neill.  My guess at 
this point is that we'll plan on being in Las Vegas by 10:30 a.m., with the 
meeting to begin at 11:00 a.m., a working lunch served at 12:00 noon, and 
adjourn somewhere around 2:00 p.m., with a return flight of 2:30 p.m.

Lou Soldano is in receipt of a few of Bill Cordes' suggestions to the letter 
that Bill will send out to Bill Mazotti that will: (1) outline the revised 
Interim Plan, including the Selexol flush, (2) notify him of our initiative 
to decon TW's filter/separators, and (3) reinforce our desire to meet on 
4/13.  If the logistics (KEYEX meeting) can be worked out, the letter will 
probably go out by Friday.

If you have any questions regarding the matters outlined above, please advise.",Non Abusive

Dear Santa: 

Listen you fat little troll, I've been  helping you out every year, playing 
at 
being the perfect Christmas present,  wearing skimpy bathing suits in frigid 
weather, and drowning in fake tea  from one too many tea parties, and I hate 
to break it to ya Santa, but IT'S  DEFINITELY PAYBACK TIME! There had better 
be some changes around here this  Christmas, or I'm gonna call for a 
nationwide meltdown (and trust me, you  won't wanna be around to smell it). 

So, here's my holiday wish list,  Santa: 

1. A nice, comfy pair of sweat pants and a frumpy, oversized  sweatshirt. I'm 
sick of looking like a hooker. How much smaller are these  bathing suits 
gonna 
get? Do you have any idea what it feels like to have  nylon and Velcro 
crawling up your butt? 

2. Real underwear that can  be pulled on and off. Preferably white. What 
bonehead at Mattel decided to  cheap out and MOLD imitation underwear to my 
skin? (It looks like  cellulite). 

3. A REAL man... maybe GI Joe. Hell, I'd take Tickle-Me Elmo  over that 
wimped-out excuse for a boyfriend Ken. And what's with that  earring anyway? 
If I'm gonna have to suffer with him, at least make him and  me anatomically 
correct. 

4. Arms that actually bend so I can push  the aforementioned Ken-wimp away 
once he is anatomically correct. 

5.  Breast reduction surgery. I don't care whose arm you have to twist, just 
get  it done. 

6. A sports bra. To wear until I get the surgery. 

7. A  new career. Pet doctor and school teacher just don't cut it. How about 
a  
systems analyst? Or better yet, an advertising account executive. 

8.  A new, more '90s persona. Maybe ""PMS Barbie,"" complete with a miniature  
container of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips;  
""Animal Rights Barbie,"" with my very own paint gun, outfitted with a fake  
fur 
coat and handcuffs; or ""Stop Smoking Barbie,"" sporting a removable  Nicotrol 
patch and equipped with several packs of gum. 

9. No more  McDonald's endorsements. The grease is wrecking my vinyl. 

10. Mattel  stock options. It's been 37 years, I think I deserve it. 

OK, Santa,  that's it. Considering my valuable contribution to society, I 
don't think  these requests are out of line. If you disagree, then you can 
find yourself  a new bimbo doll for next Christmas. It's that simple. 

Yours truly,  

Barbie

groundwater. Groundwater samples were collected from these wells on April 
5th. Lab results indicate elevated concentrations of halogenated organic 
compounds in samples collected from two of the wells. Three replacement wells 
will be drilled for the two wells which do not produce water and for one of 
the wells which only has two feet of water in the screen interval. The 
installation of the replacement wells is tentatively scheduled for the week 
of May 8th. A feasibility study for active remediation measures in the former 
impoundment area has been completed.  
The Lockridge semiannual groundwater sampling was completed.  Results will be 
forwarded to the state of Texas.
The quarterly groundwater sampling at the NNG Gomez Plant was completed. The 
recovery system was shutdown from January 17th through April 21st in order to 
evaluate the accumulation rate of PSH in recovery wells. The accumulation 
rate of PSH has been reduced considerably from the accumulation rate prior to 
active remediation. The system was re-started on April 21st and will be 
operated in a similar manner as it was operated prior to the shutdown. 
Transwestern Pipeline Company met with officials of PG&E to discuss recent 
sampling activities on the PG&E system with respect to PCB's.  Results of the 
sampling efforts have shown that PCB's have moved downstream into existing 
interconnects and into lines which feed customers.  PG&E has indicated that 
they will install small filter separators at these interconnects at pricing 
thus far of around $2MM.  This does not include the costs for the mainline 
filter separators which should be in service in June of this year.   PG&E has 
indicated that they will continue sampling at downstream locations to further 
determine the ""front of PCB's""

project to be initiated in Arizona.  Environmental concerns relating to 
management and disposal of the liquids, permitting and compliance issues were 
discussed.   This project will be initiated between C/S 4 and C/S 3.  If 
successful, the modeling approach and methodology will be implemented

Home Officing- Employees within OTS and EHS have been asked to pilot a 
telecommunicating and home officing program.  The reson being to make 
available desirable office space within the excelr, Three Allen Center and 
Brookhollow office buildings.

MIke Terraso's Replacement-    John Shafer has been selected to replace Mike 
Terraso as V.P. of GPG for Environmental and Safety.  John was formerly 
Director of Environmetnal and Safety for ANR Pipeline out of Chicago, Ill.  
John will assume responsibilities within excelr on May 8.

Performance Testing of Grandfathered Units-   There was some confusion with 
repsect to the internal position within GPG of testing grandfathered units.  
It was understood by some team members that internal portable emissions 
testing would only occur if the grandfathered unit had permitted limits on an 
air permit  or if there was a special need by the DES.  In order to clarify 
this issue, Bill will discuss this with legal and distribute a notice to the 
appropriate individuals within GPG outlining the GPG position on testing . 

Skill Base Pay- Bill is suggesting a reworking of the O&M, field trainee, and 
Level I, II and III training modules and TV Guides by the SBP review 
committee.  Bill will distribute to the committee existing documents for 
reworking and revision.  The committee will reveiw, make changes and return 
back to Bill by the mid term review meeting.

O&G MACT-    Bill will approach Marc Phillips about conducting an internal 
training for all DES personal on the forthcoming notification and conditions 
of the Oil and Gas MACT regulation and its applicability to the facilities in 
GPG.  Bill will notify each DES as to when the meeting is scheduled and 
where.  An excelr letter will be developed and distributed to the field by 5/5 
to notify EPA of those facilities which are impacted by the new MACT 
regulations.  It will be the DES's responsibility to make the notification to 
the EPA.

MId Term Peer Review Meeting-   Bill Kendrick, Rick Cates and Ken Crowl will 
keep the DES's apprised of the details relevant to the mid term review 
process and procedures to be employed for doing the review.

Cooling Tower Issue-     A request was made by BIll Kendrick to send legal a 
list of histortic or active cooling tower sites within GPG, that may have 
impacted groundwater at a site.   The criteria to be used for this 
notification is knowledge of chromate use in the cooling tower and/or  
relative proximity to a nearby recptor (drinking water well). 

Tracking Cleanup Costs-    MIke Terraso has requested work orders to be 
generated for tracking costs associated with cleanup and remedation of spills 
and releases.  The ""cut line"" for the work order generation is $1,000.

There are still no answers to the questions (below).

In addition to this I am curious that when the NYISO requests generation for
ISO security it is only Transmission Owner generation that is dispatched,
undoubtedly avoiding merchant generation from being dispatched. I was
wondering where the tariff language is to justify this type of out-of-merit
generation dispatch.

What deficiencies are there in the SCD software that it cannot handle load
pickups?
What is an NYISO SCD reserve pickup, and how does it affect generation from
setting clearing prices?

Why do these questions go unanswered, if there is tariff language to support
this please point me in the right direction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------

I have a question or two with regard to the following ""Operational
Announcements"" (Below). These are a few examples of many that are requests
for generation being requested out-of-merit by the NYISO for NYISO security.

In my limited understanding of the way SCD works I had thought that the only
reason the ISO or a Transmission Owner would request generation out-of-merit
is to resolve for a constraint or system condition that SCD could not (set
me straight if I am off-base).
Requesting generation out-of-merit to resolve for system security is an
effective method of quickly resolving for an out-of-scope SCD system problem
and by definition will not set clearing price.

1. What are the rules and procedures in place to request generation
out-of-merit both for local (Transmission Owner) and ISO request.
2. What other control actions have to be exhausted prior to initiating a
request for generation to be called on out-of-merit.
3. Are the generation bids available to the requestor(s) prior to making the
request. (Is economics a consideration?)
4. When load is available to be dispatched, will it be considered as a
control action instead of generation?
5. Is generation called on out-of-merit to resolve for DNI constraints.
6. In particular for Gilboa it was my understanding that prior to requesting
additional generation from Gilboa that an emergency was to take place. Is
there another agreement in place between the NYISO and NYPA. Below is an
excerpt from the ICAP manual.

4.4.2 Energy Limited Resources

Energy Limited Resources that are ICAP suppliers must be able to provide the
Energy equivalent of their claimed ICAP for four (4) hours each day. Energy
Limited Resources must bid or schedule in the Day-Ahead Market for
twenty-four (24) hours each day in such a way as to enable the NYISO to
schedule them for the period in which they are capable of providing the
energy.
An Energy Limited Resource must also provide the NYISO with information
concerning the hours during which it will be recharging or replacing
depleted
resources. Once the resource has provided four hours of Energy equivalent
ICAP, the NYISO will not call on an Energy Limited Resource during its
recharge
hours, except in the case of an emergency.

TURQUOISE: DECEMBER'S BIRTHSTONE
======================================
The highest ranking among all the opaque stones, turquoise-
the ""Turkish stone""-is highly prized throughout Asia and Africa,
not for its particular hoe of blue (a beautiful robin's egg or
sky blue) but more important for its supposed prophylactic and
therapeutic qualities.  The Arabs consider it a lucky stone and
have great confidence in its benevolent action.  Used in rings,
earrings, necklaces, head ornaments and amulets, it protects the
wearer from poison, reptile bites, eye diseases, and the evil
eye.  It was also believed capable of warning of impending death
by changing color.  Buddhists revere the turquoise because it is
associated with a legend in which a turquoise enabled Buddha to
destroy a monster.  Even today it is considered a symbol of
courage, success, and love.  It has also long been associated
American Indian jewelry and art.

Turquoise is an opaque, light to dark blue or blue green stone.
The finest color is an intense blue, with poorer qualities
tending toward yellowish green.  The famous Persian turquoise,
which can be very intense and pleasing blue, is considered a
very rare and valuable gem.  The United States (Arizona and New
Mexico) is also an important source of fine turquoise, and is
now the major source of turquoise used in jewelry worldwide.

All turquoises are susceptible to aging and may turn greenish
or possibly darker with age.  Also, care must be taken when
wearing, both to avoid contact with soap, grease, or other
materials that might discolor it, and to protect it from abuse,
since turquoise scratches fairly easily.

But exercise caution when buying turquoise.  This is a
frequently simulated gem.  Very fine glass imitations are
produced that are difficult to distinguish from the genuine.
Very fine adulterated stones, and reconstructed stones (from
turquoise powder bonded in plastic) saturate the marketplace, as
does synthetic turquoise.  Make sure you are buying ""genuine,
natural turquoise.""


THE DRESDEN DIAMOND: GREEN GLORY
=================================
The legendary 40.70 carat Dresden green diamond is now on
display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.,
right next to the Hope diamond, until January 10th of next
year--thanks to Ronald Winston, son of the 20th century's
most famous jewel merchant, Harry Winston.

Today the Dresden is to green diamonds what the Hope is to
blues; the most famous gem of its kind.  Estimated to have
lost at least 60 percent of its original 100-carat-plus
weight during cutting, this green giant takes the prize for
size as well as beauty.

Keep in mind that beauty in green diamonds is nothing like
beauty in emerald, jade, or green grossular garnet.  Natural
green diamonds are extremely uncommon occurrences, the result
of irradiation deep within the earth.  And when they are found,
most are pale in color and light in tone, running a hue
spectrum from apple to algae green.  Don't expect these
diamonds to sport stop light or shampoo-green colors.

Nevertheless, the Dresden is a marvel--from a standpoint of
both shading and size.  True, there are green diamonds
without the vibrancy muting gray of the Dresden, but their
far smaller size makes them seem tiny in comparison.  The
Dresden is such a behemoth, at least as far as green diamonds go,
that it sets a standard that will likely never be challenged,
let alone beat.

DO YOU WANT A COLORED GEMSTONE?
==================================
If you have ever wanted a gorgeous colored gemstone but
never knew how to find one, this is your chance to have one
hand picked for you.  In Tucson, Arizona during the first
weekend of February, the country's largest colored gem
trade show brings gem wholesalers from all over the world.
We will be attending the show to hand select the nicest
gems possible for our customers.

There are hundreds of booths of gems including: ruby, emerald,
sapphire, garnet, amethyst, tourmaline, jade, peridot,
spinel, and tanzanite.  If you would like us to add your
name to our shopping list, give us a call and tell us what
you are looking for. Every year we make many customers'
dreams come true as we find terrific values on the highest
quality gemstones in the world.


MEN'S WEDDING BANDS
======================
While there are hundreds, if not thousands, of women's
wedding ring style, there are relatively few common style of
men's rings.  The vast majority of men prefer some type of
comfort fit wedding band.  The term comfort fit comes from
the rounded inside of the ring that helps eliminate the
sharp edges.  Comfort bands come in a variety of finishes
including polished, two tone, hand craved, and milgrain
edges.

For men, the choice seems to focus more on the width of the
band which can range from 2 millimeters wide alll the way
up to 12 millimeters.  Sometimes couples decide to get
matching bands and/or rings but generally each will pick
what they think looks best and is most comfortable to them.

While the current trend is for the use of platinum in
women's wedding rings, men are often surprised how heavy and
expensive a wide man's band is if it is done in platinum.
Yellow and/or white gold is still the preferred metal for men.

Because men tend to wear their rings all the time, the rings
tend to take much more abuse than a women's ring.  A women
will take her ring off to wash her hands, do the dishes,
or fix dinner.  Men leave their rings on to mow the yard,
fix the car, or participate in sports.  This is probably
why you don't see many diamonds in men's wedding bands--
plus the fact that men learn early that most families
can only afford one jewelry lover.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


DIAMOND DISTRICT DANGERS
=========================
When we visit with customers, we often hear that they are
contemplating making a trip to the diamond district in New
York to shop for a diamond.  Many people have heard of the
major diamond trading center located on 47th Street in New
York and the myth is that you can get a good deal there.
In reality, the wholesale trading takes place high above
the street in high-security offices hidden from the public.

The vendors on the street are more skilled at taking your
money than anyone you will find in your community.  They
are fast taking, high pressure salesman who specialize in
letting tourist think they are getting a deal.  They often
sell uncertified diamonds and reply on the difficulty of
customers returning to the Diamond District as part of
their sales strategy.

We recommend you never buy from anyone in the Diamond
District in New York unless you are there with a trusted
retailer who takes you to the true dealers who are not
at street level.  Don't become another statistic of one
who got ripped off while trying to get a good deal in
the Diamond District.


ONLY BUY THE CLARITY YOU NEED
=============================
We see more and more customers being told they need
VVS clarity or they will be able to see inclusions in the
their diamond.  Why pay for something you can not see?

For all shapes except emerald, we suggest VS2 or SI1
as your minimum clarity requirement since with an SI1 you
can not see anything with your naked eye.  The truth is
that you can not see the difference between SI1 and all
the higher clarity grades except with a microscope.
Higher clarity than SI1 does not add to beauty of the
diamond, only the rarity and therefore the price.  By
starting with an SI1 clarity you will get a bigger
diamond and have a better selection for getting a great
cut.  The highest clarity grades cost more but are not
necessarily going to appreciate as much as the grades in
most demand such as VS2 and SI1 as explained at
http://www.dsourceva.com/investment.htm on our web site.
The reality is that the first speck of dust that settles
on the diamond has much more visual impact on the beauty of
the diamond than anything in a diamond that is at least a
certified SI1 clarity grade.


50% OFF SALE
========================
You have all seen the billboards and newspaper ads
advertising half off sale at your local jeweler.  It is
not uncommon for stores to mark up items 300-500% so they
can mark them half-price during a sale. It's no great deal
if you are paying 50%, let alone 150% over wholesale.

Don't fall for sales of any kind.  If a dealer can afford
to mark it down, then they marked it up too high at the
start.


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:

FAMOUS DIAMONDS
===============
Name The Star of Sierra Leone
Weight: 968.90 carats rough

Valentine's Day, 1972.   A routine workday at the diamond
mine in Sierra Leone.  Suddenly, a company engineer and a
plant security officer spot something big on the grease table
(grease sticks to diamonds and is used to separate diamonds
from ore).  At first, neither man could believe what they
saw.  There, trapped by the grease, is a huge diamond, the
size of a hen's egg.

When the stone is first offered for sale, none of the sealed
bids reaches the minimum price of more than $2.5 million set
by the government.  Finally, months later, Harry Winston
makes a deal for the Star.  Winston wants a world-class
diamond from his rough.  A 143.20 carat emerald cut is
fashioned, but upon close examination, it reveals inclusions.
Winston changes his mind, deciding that flawlessness is
more important than size.

The big diamond is recut into seven smaller stones, the
largest of which weighs 32.52 carats.  Besides these, the
rough yields 10 other stones ranging from 1.85 to 53.96
carats.  All told, Winston recovers only 238.48 carats, a
staggering loss of almost 75 percent.  But 13 of the 17
finished stones are reportedly flawless.

GEM OF THE DAY
==================================
Keep smiling.  Even when life knocks you flat on your back,
you are still in a good position to look up.

BEWARE OF FRACTIONS
==================================
The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) allows jewelers to round
off diamond weights.  For example, a diamond labeled 3/4 carat
in weight might actually weigh anywhere between .69 and .81
carat.  While these are small weights, the price difference
can be significant.  For instance, if you bought earrings with
G color, SI1 clarity and 3/4 carat in each ear for $5160, you
might have over paid by $1600 if they really weight .69 carats.

Note: Jewelers are also allowed to be off one color and one
clarity grade.  If you don't purchase a certified diamond,
you could find yourself at the short end on weight, color,
clarity and therefore, value.

INTERNET SALES
==================================
Internet shoppers are expected to spend almost $20 billion
online during the 2000 holiday season, nearly double last
year's total of $10.5 billion, according to a recent survey by
the Gartner Interactive Firm.  About half that revenue is
expected to go to U.S. and Canadian e-tailers, with the rest
distributed among firms in Europe and Asia.

Robert Labatt, principal analyst for Gartner's e-Business
Services Unit, credits the increased willingness to do
business online to the e-tailers' extensive efforts in
increasing the customer's comfort level.  Chat rooms and
opportunities to interact with the internet firms are
encouraging more people to try this form of commerce.

DIAMOND GRADING TIPS: FLUORESCENCE
==================================
Fluorescence, if present in a diamond, will be indicated on
a diamond grading report.  It will be graded very faint,
faint, medium, strong, or very strong.  Some reports
indicate the color of fluorescence as blue, yellow, white,
and so on.  A stone with yellow fluorescence should sell
less since it will appear yellower than it really is when
worn in daylight or fluorescent lighting.  The presence of
blue fluorescence will not detract, and in some cases may
be considered a bonus since it may make the stone appear
whiter than it really is in daylight or fluorescent
lighting.  However, if there is very strong fluorescence,
there may be an oily or milky appearance to the diamond.
We recommend avoiding medium or strong fluorescence since
it is just not worth taking the chance of lower value.


BOW TIE
=======
One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning
in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie, or butterfly effect,
a darkened area across the center or widest part of the
stone, depending upon the cut.  The bow tie is commonly
seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any
fancy shape.  Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will
exhibit some minimal bow tie effect.  Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper
proportioning.  In poorly proportioned stones there is a
pronounced bow tie; the more pronounced, the poorer the
proportioning.  The less pronounced the bow tie, the better
the proportioning.  The degree to which the bow tie is
evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make (cut).


DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS
=========================
One of the best ways to be a better shopper for diamonds and
fine jewelry is to read one or more of the great books
listed at the following web page:

We are sending this quick note to our diamond customers who are still 
shopping to let you know that the holiday rush has begun.  If you are hoping 
to present your special gift before Christmas, be aware that while we can get 
diamonds in quickly the calendar is getting short for getting a custom 
mounting made.  In another week it will become difficult to get diamonds 
quickly set in mounting.  What normally takes 2-3 days suddenly turns into a 
week long process as the setters are buried with ring sizing, diamond setting 
and other jewelry preparation for the big gift giving days.

If you are planning on presenting your gift after Christmas, you'll have 
plenty of time but the supply of diamonds is as good now as it will be until 
early February.  Unlike cars, TV sets and computers that come down in price 
when the snow falls or following Christmas, we have yet to see diamond prices 
fall.  They tend to keep going up year after year which is good if you own 
them, but a challenge if you are waiting to buy.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST (Mon-Sat) since we are dealing with customers 
and suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always 
want to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs 
and answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Attached in support of Agenda Item 5B , ICAP, for the December 12, 2000
Business Issues Committee meeting, and pursuant to the motion passed at the
December 1, 2000 BIC meeting, are the following documents:

1. A clean version of proposed Tariff language on Stage 1A ICAP, consisting
of all those modifications made by the ICAPWG over the course of their
deliberations in the last few months with the exception of  (1) UCAP and (2)
one month OPP; and

2. A blacklined version of that proposed Tariff, marked to show changes from
the current Tariff.

The clean version includes a table of contents for ease of review.

Please note that, pursuant to the motion passed by BIC on December 1,
substantive changes not included in the ICAPWG November 21 Proposed Tariff
(considered by BIC on December 1) must be presented on separate motion at
the December 12 meeting.  The ISO has one such change, to Section 5.12.10;
the language was circulated prior to the December 1 BIC meeting and will be
recirculated tomorrow.

I sent a letter to Mike Katz, copy to Rod Boschee, that formally restated 
what I had requested at our last meeting in San Francisco. They responded 
with what they agree to, which I believe we can (and will have to) live with.

I will not be attending the meeting this Thursday due to conflicts, but will 
be available to attend via phone.

1.  TW will fund in year 2000 the installation of the necessary PG&E customer 
filter separators and the additional costs related to PG&E's PCB testing.

action items
GQC: Thoroughly review PG&E customer F/S sites and costs. Formally get 
agreement.

Earl: Prepare a new work order for $3,000,000 naming specific sites and costs 
related to sampling and analysis.

Note: I have requested an additional $3,000,000 for this years Capital Plan 
to do this work, which Bill has received verbally from Stan. 

2. PG&E will lift the 250 / D limit and move to market driven conditions of 
up to 300 / D at Topock on May 15 with on-going monitoring to ensure no 
further migration of PCB's. They wish for a six month test on this condition.

action item:
Rich: Review formal pigging and sampling plan with Tiny and Needles Team.

Rich / Larry: Increase or reinforce pigging and analysis on Topock Lateral, 
as well as any mainline pigging and analysis required due to Gallup increase 
volumes.

3. PG&E will delay / defer consideration of deconning the Topock Compressor 
Station until 2001. Tests in 2001 will determine further consideration.

4. Establishment of a gas quality committee (GQC): Larry, Rich, Earl. (I will 
continue as the lead on this with Louis Saldano available)  

GQC: Take and distribute formal minutes with agreed action items.

Re:       Extraordinary Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw:
External Proxy Bus Prices During Transmission Constraints
(ECA 20001208B; re-issuance of ECA 20001006B)


Thank  you  for  the  presentation of the Market Monitoring and Performance
Unit  and  the Market Advisor regarding the progress that has been made with 
the
Market Participants in addressing the market design flaw in the Real-Time 
energy
markets  concerning  external  proxy  bus  prices during transmission 
limitation
periods.  I am pleased that the Business Issues Committee gave unanimous 
support
to  the  NYISO  to  re-issue  ECA  20001006B  until  the Market Participants 
can
consider  and  approve, and the NYISO can implement, a tariff change required 
to
permanently address the Market Design Flaw.

As  stated  in  my Memorandum to you of October 6, 2000, I agreed with your
conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a 

?Market Design
Flaw?  as  defined  in  Attachment  Q  to  the ISO OATT, Temporary 
Extraordinary
Procedures  for  Correcting  Market  Design  Flaws  and  Addressing 
Transitional
Abnormalities (the ?TEPs?).  As further stated in that Memorandum, I agreed 
with
your  analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw 
would,
absent  appropriate  action,  remain  different  from what would otherwise 
occur
during periods of efficient competition.

I  have  now  determined,  based  on  consultations  with ISO Staff and the
support  of the Business Issues Committee, that it is appropriate to maintain 
in
effect  the  corrective measures adopted as ECA 20001006B while consultation 
and
cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is 
on-going
to  develop  and  implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance 
with
the ISO Agreement.

Please re-issue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action (?ECA?) and
post  it  on  the  OASIS,  for implementation effective at the expiration of 
ECA
20001006B.  The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety (90) days.

Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208B

Market Design Flaw Regarding Real-Time External Proxy Bus Prices


Applicability

This  Extraordinary  Correction Action (ECA) shall apply when the following
two conditions are met:

?    Transactions are proposed for an operating hour at an External Proxy Bus;
and
?    The Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) resolves transmission congestion
constraints at the External Proxy Bus for the operating hour, resulting in
transmission congestion charges in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM).

Rationale

When BME solves for proposed transactions at an External Proxy Bus, and the
total  proposed  transactions  exceed  the available transfer capacity, BME 
will
resolve binding constraints at that External Proxy Bus using the decremental 
bid
price  or  the sink price cap bid indicated by the Market Participants 
proposing
the transactions.

In  the  operating hour, the transfer capability and scheduled flows at the
External  Proxy  Bus  are  fixed,  and  SCD  is  not  required  to  resolve  
for
transmission  congestion  costs  associated  with  the  scheduled  
transactions.
Therefore, in operating hours where an External Proxy Bus constraint is 
binding,
Real-Time  prices at the External Proxy Bus will be significantly different 
from
the  HAM  prices,  due  to  the  absence  of transmission congestion costs 
being
reflected  in  the Real-Time price.  Currently, scheduled HAM transactions at 
an
External  Proxy Bus are settled at the Real-Time price at the External Proxy 
Bus
during  the operating hour, and the import transactions receive a Bid 
Production
Cost Guarantee for the deviation in price between the HAM and Real-Time price.

The  Market  Design  Flaw  in  the  current  process  is  that transmission
congestion  constraints  present  when  BME  schedules  HAM transactions are 
not
reflected  in the Real-Time settlement prices.  Under the rules set forth 
below,
the  transmission  congestion  costs present in BME will be reflected in the 
SCD
prices, so that a Market Participant proposing a HAM transaction will be 
charged
the  full  cost of supplying that transaction, up to the decremental bid cost 
or
sink  price  cap  bid  indicated  by  the Market Participant at the time the 
HAM
transaction was proposed.

Implementation Rules

1.   These rules apply in hours that HAM import or export transactions are
constrained in BME at an External Proxy Bus (EPB) by a transmission limitation
or Desired Network Interchange (DNI) limit (an ?EPB Limit?).

2.   For each hour in which an EPB Limit constrains net imports to NYCA from 
an
External Proxy Bus in the HAM, the Real-Time settlement price at that External
Proxy Bus will be the lesser of the real-time LBMP or the BME price at that
External Proxy Bus.

3.   For each hour which an EPB Limit constrains net exports from NYCA to an
External Proxy Bus in the HAM, the Real-Time settlement price at that External

MEMO


Date:          December 8, 2000

Re:       Extraordinary Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw:
HAM Transactions Failing Checkout (ECA 20001208A; re-issuance of ECA
20000907A)


Thank  you  for  the  presentation of the Market Monitoring and Performance
Unit  and  the Market Advisor regarding the progress that has been made with 
the
Market  Participants  in addressing the market design flaw concerning import 
and
export   transactions,  including  wheel-through  transactions,  that  fail  
the
check-out procedure between the completion of BME and the SCD operating 
hour.  I
am  pleased  that  the  Business  Issues Committee gave unanimous support to 
the
NYISO  to  re-issue ECA 20000907A until the Market Participants can consider 
and
approve,  and  the  NYISO can implement, a tariff change required to 
permanently
address the Market Design Flaw.

As  stated in my Memorandum to you of September 6, 2000, I agreed with your
conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a 

?Market Design
Flaw?  as  defined  in  Attachment  Q  to  the ISO OATT, Temporary 
Extraordinary
Procedures  for  Correcting  Market  Design  Flaws  and  Addressing 
Transitional
Abnormalities (the ?TEPs?).  As further stated in that Memorandum, I agreed 
with
your  analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw 
would,
absent  appropriate action, remain at levels different from what would 
otherwise
occur during periods of efficient competition.

I  have  now  determined,  based  on  consultations  with ISO Staff and the
support  of the Business Issues Committee, that it is appropriate to maintain 
in
effect  the  corrective measures adopted as ECA 20000907A while consultation 
and
cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is 
on-going
to  develop  and  implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance 
with
the ISO Agreement.

Please re-issue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action (?ECA?) and
post  it  on  the  OASIS,  for implementation effective at the expiration of 
ECA
20000907A.  The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety (90) days.

Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208A:

Market Design Flaw Regarding HAM Transactions Failing Checkout


Applicability

This Extraordinary Correction Action (ECA) shall apply to:

?    Import and export transactions;
?    that are scheduled for an operating hour in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM) 
by
the Balancing Market Evaluation (BME); and
?    that fail checkout for reasons within the control of the Market
Participant, or that are cancelled at the request of said Market Participant.

Wheel-through transactions shall be treated as both an import and an export
transaction, and the relevant Market Participant shall be billed the sum of 
both
financial impacts, as provided below.  This ECA shall not apply to import,
export, or wheel-through transactions that fail checkout due to NYISO error or
action, or neighboring control area operator error or action.

Rationale

Import Transactions: During the HAM resolution, BME reduces commitments for
energy  resources  within  NYCA  to  accept  scheduled  import transactions 
at a
specific  proxy  bus  indicated  by the Market Participant.  Where the 
scheduled
import  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the real-time energy price 
at
the  proxy  bus  may  be  elevated  above the HAM price due to the failed 
import
transaction.   The  difference  between the real-time price and the BME price 
at
that  proxy  bus is currently charged to all purchasers in the real-time 
market.
Under  this  ECA,  this  amount  (when  positive),  multiplied  by the number 
of
megawatts  of  the  transaction  for  that  hour,  shall be billed to the 
Market
Participant that scheduled the failed import transaction as the financial 
impact
of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Export  Transactions:  During the HAM resolution, BME makes commitments for
energy  resources  to  supply  scheduled  export transactions up to the 
purchase
price  indicated  by the Market Participant at the appropriate proxy bus.  
Where
the  scheduled  export  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  the proxy bus may be depressed below the HAM price due to 
the
failed  export  transaction.   The  difference  between  the  BME  price and 
the
real-time  price  at that proxy bus is currently charged to all loads as part 
of
Schedule  1  costs.   Under this ECA, this amount (when positive), multiplied 
by
the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour, shall be billed to 
the
Market Participant that scheduled the failed export transaction as the 
financial
impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Wheel-Through   Transactions:  During  the  HAM  resolution,  BME  includes
scheduled wheel-through transactions up to the transmission congestion cost 
that
equals  the  decremental  bid  indicated  by  the Market Participant.  Where 
the
scheduled  wheel-through transaction fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  both  the  import  and export proxy busses may be elevated 
or
depressed,  respectively,  due  to the effects on transmission congestion of 
the
failed wheel-through transaction.  Under this ECA, the effects of the import 
and
export  portions  of  the  failed  wheel-through  transaction will be 
calculated
separately,  as though they were separate failed transactions.  The sum of 
those
impacts  shall  be  billed  to  the Market Participant that scheduled the 
failed
wheel-through  transaction  as  the  financial  impact of causing the failure 
to
complete checkout of the transaction.

Implementation Rules


1.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
delivered to the NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity
selling the amount of energy scheduled in BME into the LBMP Market at the
scheduling entity?s BME Bid Price, and buying the energy that was not 
delivered
from the LBMP Market at the Real-Time LBMP prevailing at the external Proxy
Generator Bus.  No payment will be required of the scheduling entity if it is
shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control 
Area
and the energy was not delivered due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
delivering Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the 
Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is lower
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to deliver scheduled energy.

2.   An External Transaction for the receipt of energy from the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
received from NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity 
buying
the amount of energy scheduled in BME from the LBMP Market at the scheduling
entity?s BME Bid Price and selling the energy that was not taken into the LBMP
Market at the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus.  No payment
will be required by the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External
Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not
taken by the scheduling entity due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
receiving Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is 
higher
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to take scheduled energy.

3.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at one
external Proxy Generator Bus and the delivery of energy from the NYCA at a
different external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which 
no
energy is delivered to or received from the NYCA in real-time, will be settled
by applying rules 1 and 2 of this ECA separately to the failed delivery of
energy to the import Proxy Generator Bus and the failed receipt of energy at 
the
export Proxy Generator Bus, and summing the total of the two amounts for 
payment
by the scheduling entity.  No payment will be required by the scheduling 
entity
if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each
Control Area and the energy was not taken by the scheduling entity due to an
error or action by the NYISO or the delivering or receiving Control Area.  No
payment will be required of, or made to the Market Participant for the import 
or
the export portion of the External Transaction if no payment would have been
required had that portion of the transaction been a separate transaction under
rule 1 or 2 of this ECA.

Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on 
schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system.  
PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of 
separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon 
tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not 
create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, 
according to PG&E, are in place.

PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to 
discuss maintenance issues with ET&S.

Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. 
pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or 
disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E 
will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or 
dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has 
indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce 
costs associated with cleaning the pipe.

2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. 

Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at 
MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round 
of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples 
collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to 
be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels 
north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing 
showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has 
been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be 
collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant 
to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is 
considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's.

Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The 
gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas 
Co.  system which is PCB free.

3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. 

West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system 
has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these 
locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to 
have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the 
sampling program.  
Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs 
under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the 
pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the 
bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By 
increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced.

It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the 
separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks.

4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators.

Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter 
separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The 
determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1) 
a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of 
the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm.
Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station) 
have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern 
River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have 
shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this 
location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that 
there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume 
of gas deliveries.

PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional 
filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer 
load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection 
at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express 
additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations.

5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators.

 a. Siting, Design and Engineering

 b. Cost Estimates 

PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus 
an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next 
week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter 
separators may be proposed for installation.  

The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29 
indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have 
not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites 
basis as PG&E presented.

One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions 
of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement 
company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the 
success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the 
cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it 
will be a 2001 project.

6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection.

Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic 
sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to 
the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the 
Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies 
to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will 
coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle.

7. Other Issues or Concerns.

Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January, 
2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to 
Transwestern.  

PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300 
mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S 
configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day.  

8. Next Steps.

The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow 
inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection   
additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location 
of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as 
some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on 
other business.  ",Non Abusive

NRG respectfully requests a written clarification of the events and
consequences of the apparent schedule deviation on Phase I/II for December
08 HE21.  The data shows a schedule of 1100mw into NE and an actual flow of
450mw, a deficiency of at least 650mw for the entire hour.

Questions:
1. Is the data correct?  If no what was the error?  If yes see below;
2. Was there an emergency energy sale to HQ for this hour to cover the
deficiency?
3. What was the impact to energy and ancillary prices?
4. What was the impact on the NERC performance criteria (CPS1 and CPS2)?
5. Is the deficiency intended to be resolved thru inadvertent energy
account?


Below is the printout of the flow and schedule.

Thanks

A TRUE FRIEND

When you are sad ...
I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.

When you are blue ...
I'll try to dislodge what ever's choking you.

When you smile ...
I'll know you finally got laid.

When you are scared ...
I will rag you about it every chance I get.

When you are worried ...
I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and tell
you to quit whining.

When you are confused ...
I will use little words to explain it to your dumb ass.

When you are sick ...
Stay the hell away from me until you're well again, I don't want whatever
you have.

When you fall ...
I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.

This is my oath ...
I pledge till the end. Why you may ask? ...
Because you're my friend.

Discussion List:

Greetings,

I was surprised today to learn that MSWG is recommending a delay in the
implementation of zonal price capped load bidding until the fall, when
it can be implemented simultaneously with virtual bidding.

The priority assigned to zonal PCLB is a settled issue and one that is
not properly before the MSWG or BIC at this time. The NYISO Management
and Board have already determined that implementation of zonal PCLB by
May is one of the ISO's highest priorities. Implementation of zonal PCLB
by this summer is even part of the NYISO Business Plan, Goal and
Objectives, and Incentive Compensation plan. In addition, the project
prioritization process adopted by the Management Committee has ratified
the priority assigned to this critical effort.

Apart from sporadic concerns raised by a few generators, there has never
been any indication that zonal PCLB should be delayed until virtual
bidding can be implemented. Indeed, it appears that the decision by the
MSWG to advance this proposal was decided upon at the last meeting of
the Virtual Bidding Task Force which does not even have official
standing as a NYISO subcommittee. That meeting's material did not in any
way indicate that such a major change was being contemplated, let alone
that it would be a recommendation to the BIC less than a week later.

The Price Responsive Load Coalition strongly supports the ISO's previous
decisions to implement zonal PCLB by this summer and views it as a
critical component of the state's efforts to engage loads' participation
in the market in a meaningful way. We will oppose any efforts to delay
implementation simply because some generators raise speculative fears of
""manipulation"" of the markets by loads.

While there may well be merit to implementing zonal PCLB and virtual
bidding simultaneously, the proposal now before us threatens to throw
the baby out with the bathwater, depriving customers of one of their
only means of ameliorating the effects of markets that may not be
workably competitive.

From both a procedural and substantive perspective, the proposal
presented to the BIC is fundamentally defective and must be rejected.

Sincerely,
Aaron Breidenbaugh
Executive Director

Vince - 

I certainly appreciate the opportunity to have our group attend
a session given by excelr Research.  While afternoons are typically
the best time to meet, we do have a trader's meeting each Mon & Wed
at 3:30.  If we can accomodate this regular meeting either by scheduling
an earlier meeting on Monday or going for Tue/Thurs, that would be 
great.  Otherwise we can go ahead with the Mon @ 3:30 with an audience
that might be a bit smaller.

Thanks again

George

1.)  Ms. Bernacik indicated that the POEP has formed a Superfund division 
which is lead by a fellow named Mr. Rizvi. Mr. Rizvi had contacted Ms. 
Bernacik and requested the opportunity to be present at the site during the 
next semiannual sampling event. This event is tentatively scheduled for the 
week of June 19th. I am to notify Ms. Bernacik when we have set a firm date 
for sampling. 
2.)  Ms. Bernacik asked if we had received an extension to the off-site 
access permit from the Pueblo so that we could install the three additional 
wells. I indicated that I believe the extension was issued and Norm had 
picked it up but I wasn't certain. I followed-up with Norm and he has picked 
up the permit. Drilling activities are scheduled for the week of June 5th.
3.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about our request for no further action on the UST 
removal. Ms. Bernacik indicated that Norm Moreno at the POEP had responded to 
her with comments on the request and recommended against closing the issue. 
Ms. Bernacik said that she would send us a copy of Mr. Moreno's letter. At a 
minimum, the Pueblo will require continued monitoring. This does not change 
our monitoring plan since we had already proposed continued monitoring of the 
UST area wells as part of our facility wide groundwater monitoring program. 
However, Ms. Bernacik also indicated that the Pueblo may require one or two 
additional monitor wells in the former UST area.
4.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about backfilling the former UST excavation area. 
Ms. Bernacik indicated that her office had already issued an approval of TW's 
request to close the landfarm. I asked again about backfilling the excavation 
but was having difficulty communicating my interest was backfilling the 
excavation rather than closure of the landfarm. I reviewed the letter from 
Ms. Bernacik regarding closure of the landfarm and it does not specifically 
address backfilling the excavation. I believe that Ms. Bernacik is under the 
impression that her office has already approved backfilling the excavation, 
if we still want to get this in writing, it may be best for Norm to visit 
with Ms. Bernacik at her office in order to better explain what we need.",Non Abusive

back with you and see if there is anything we can do to help you with your 
diamond buying decision? Our goal is to help you make an informed decision 
that you will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, since we don't own 
these stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find 
the very best diamond for you at a great price.

Since you have not responded to any of our emails these past 8 weeks, we 
assume you are no longer shopping for a diamond and will remove your name 
from our active customer list.  We hope that if you are still shopping you 
will contact us so we can help you find a great diamond.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Subject: SPS Grandfathered agreement on Blackwater tie.


This is an announcement of a working policy for making service across
the Blackwater tie into WSCC in the event the SPS , bundled,
grandfathered is temporarily interrupted.  In order to preserve
competition without displacing the reservation close to the ramp, SPS
has agreed to notify SPP prior to the top of each hour whether or not
they will be making any attempt to restore the IP agreement at the top
of the next hour.  Once that designation has been declared, SPP will
open the market at the top of the hour for next-hour only service to the
BLKW DC Tie.  SPS has stated that 12/12/2000 HE 19 will be available for
service.  A similar notice will be posted to the OASIS and SPP will
follow this policy until further notice.

on the SoCal system, for which Transwesten is 86% responsible, Ralph Komai, 
SoCal's PCB person provded some addtional information with respect to what is 
going on with the PCB activities on the SoCal system.  As a result of the 
PG&E press release, SoCal management directed additional sampling to be done 
at their interconnect with Transwestern and downstream of this interconnect.  
Ralph reported that a number of liquid samples came back at around 7 ppm, 
however one sample at their Kelso Station, near Barstow,  came back at 77 
ppm. 

Ralph had indicated that there has been an increase in the PCB's coming into 
their collection locations in the Needles area as evidenced by the following:

 Based upon 1997 data, almost no liquids greater than 50 ppm were revcovered

 Data collected in 1998 showed that approx. 8% of the liquids were greater 
than 50 ppm

 Data collected in 1999 showed that approx. 9% of the liquids were greater 
than 50 ppm

Based upon this, Ralph had stated that SoCal would be collecting additional 
sampling information and possibly entering into an internal montoring 
program, somewhat like PG&E is currently doing now.

I had informed Ralph that our Needles M/S facility had seen almost no liquids 
in the last 5 years, other than a recent accumulation of a one time pigging 
in early 2000 when a small volume of liquids (less than 55 gallons) had been 
collected.   We discussed that the accumulations seen on the SoCal system 
were probably from existing liquids on their system which had collected in 
low points in their pipeline and were moving downstream due to the increased 
flows from TW into SoCal.  

Ralph gave the impression that there were no immediate management tensions 
resulting from the recent ""hits"".  He just indicated that they would be 
watching their system and sampling at a more frequent basis.",Non Abusive

implement its own noise criteria in areas within New Mexico that are deemed 
sensitive by the BLM.  The proposed noise threshold will be 48.6 DBA(A).  
There are no Transwestern facilities in the Farmington resource area which 
will be impacted by this proposed level, however the potential exists for 
several Transwestern locations in southeast New Mexico to be impacted.  

A meeting was held with the president of Del Mar, concerning the issues 
associated with the lead in their lead acetate tape for monitoring sulfur 
concentrations in the natural gas.  A  request  was made to the company to 
determine the feasability of recycling the tape and eleviate the management 
and disposal issues associated with the tape as a hazardous waste.  

The quarterly SoCal Transwestern PCB conference call was held this week.  
Transwesten's share (86%) of SoCal's PCB management activities was approx. 
$79,000.  Due to the press release  by PG&E concerning the increased 
occurance of PCB's into their system, SoCal has initiated increased sampling 
activities on their system and will be proposing to do additional monitoring 
to track liquids from Transwestern's M/S into the SoCal system.  Preliminary 
sampling results at strategic liquids locations on the SoCal system has 
revealed hits of PCB's in the range of 7-10 ppm, although, a  hit of 77 ppm  
was discovered.  

As a result of an isolated hit of PCB's into the new filter separator at the 
PG&E C/S in excess of regulated levels, a  conference call was held the ET&S 
VP to determine forthcoming activities with PG&E.  A meeting has been 
scheduled at the PG&E C/S next week to reveiw sampling on the PG&E system and 
discuss the recent hit of PCB's in the F/S and what forthcoming activities 
will be conducted at the site.",Non Abusive

We completed decontamination of the inlet filter at the selexol plant today. 
It was dirty but 
no liquid. There was some dried sludge in the bottom of the vessel and the 
filters were 
extremely dirty. We plan to do both of the filters on the discharge side 
tomorrow.I got a phone 
messsage from Jeff and he hasn't heard anything from PGE since the letter was

plan to bypass and clean the filter on the west side of the river, last one

45207,campbell-l/discussion_threads/120.,<30565070.1075851897105.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"As a result of the latest meeting with PG&E over the greater than 500 ppm PCB 
liquids collection at the PGE Topock C/S filter separator (F/S), presented 
below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred 
6/29/00.

Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the 
cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water 
mixture).  Diesel was not used in the deconning process.  The only equipment 
cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S.  Transwestern's filters in its separator 
were replaced,  but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit.   
The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator.

The following samples were collected during this project:

On the Transwestern side:

 1. Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters 
were removed.  Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of   
PCB's.  (Not 100 sq. cm. sample)

 2. A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator 
at the Selexol Plant.  The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 

 3. Composite sample of the fine powdery rust  which had collected in the 
bottom of the F/S.   Approximte volume one cup.  
 
 4. Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S. Visible appearance of 
the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and    virtually 
unstained.  A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter 
confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S. 

 5. A sample of an unused clean stocked filter.  This was a control sample. 


On the PG&E side:

 1. A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter 
separator prior to deconning.  Approx. volume one cup

 2. Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the 
F/S.  An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S   prior 
to deconning was approximately one gallon.

 3. Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100 
cm sq. wipe)

 4. Used filter media from the F/S.  The operation of the F/S filters are 
designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter.  Composite samples   
were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters.

 5. Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls. 

The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process 
was the volume and  buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material 
which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount 
of rust colored material which was present  in Transwestern's F/S .  As 
previously mentioned, samples were collected of  both materials.  The only 
difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the 
volume.  It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of 
99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had 
over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S.  The small amount of rust 
materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging 
activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S.  I will have 
reprensentataive samples of both materials.  

Photographs  were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and 
will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in Flagstaff with 
PG&E.
on the 13th of July.  Analytical results will also be completed at this time.

Subject: RE: mea culpa



  Public Statement by the Rev. Jesse Jackson

  Due to the great consternation caused by the
  revelation of my act of procreation, I accept my
  obligation to give an explanation to the
  population for my act of copulation.

  I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of
  sexual gratification, that I could not obtain through
  masturbation, resulted in my fornication.
   I accepted her invitation, and provided her with
  excitation, stimulation, penetration, replication, and
  liberation.

  She provided lubrication (to avoid inflammation) and I
  wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried  for
  duplication but I insisted upon
  termination, in spite of her fascination with
  variation.

  This has caused me great aggravation, and the
  agitation and provocation of the media has resulted in
  my humiliation, denigration, and
  degradation. My wife is considering castration, which
  would require my hospitalization.

  Pray that this matter will find culmination in my
  sanctification and rehabilitation so that my plans for
  nomination to my ultimate vocation will not result in
  revocation and termination.I hope this proclamation
  has provided illumination and verification and will
  prohibit further provocation (or investigation).

  Sincerely,
  The Rev. Jesse Jackson

2000 during a meeting with PG&E at TW's Flagstaff Compressor Station.  One of 
the critical issues that came out of this effort was finding out from PG&E 
that they need TW's deliveries to blend into the richer gas that they are 
receiving from El Paso and Kern River so they can meet their air permit 
emission limits on VOC's.  If they do not have TW's deliveries (dry gas) for 
the blending they will not be able to maintain compliance in some 
non-attainment areas.  John Shafer

condensate spills to its District Offices for implementation on July 1, 
2000.  Attached is the guideline which is titled,  

Field Guide for the Assessment and Cleanup of Soil and Groundwater 
Contaminated with Condensate From a Spill Incident (Statewide Rules 8, 20, 
and 91)

The introduction to the guideline states that it establishes bench marks and 
protocols that, when met and followed, will demonstrate that condensate 
spills have been addressed in a manner that complies with Statewide Rules 8, 
20, and 91.

Some comments related to this guideline from an industry association meeting 
in mid-July are listed below:

There appeared to be a wide variation in response of the districts to this 
guideline.

The TRC is receiving landowner compliants.  The TRC has gone out and found 
spills not cleaned up, where closure reports have been submitted.  

Parts of the guideline are not clear and the groundwater classification is 
not consistent with TRRP.  A revised guideline might be issued by TRC.

This condensate guideline is temporary until RBCA guidelines are available.  
TRC is working on a software model projected by the end of this year.

Also attached is another guideline that the TRC issued at the same time, 
which is titled:

Field Guide for Reportable Surface Releases of Crude Oil in Non-sensitive 
Areas (Statewide Rules 8, 20, and 91).

In a somewhat related item, the General Land Office on June 23, 2000 issued 
revised penalty guidelines (attached) effective August 1st for oil spills in 
Texas coastal waters.  Spills of less than a gallon will have fines of $250.  
The fines for larger spills will depend on factors such as the size of the 
spills, the number of unauthorized discharges in the past twelve-month 
period, and whether a Sound Management Practice or like program is in place.

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage excelr's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for excelr travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from excelr's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for excelr 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of excelr 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

While there is a wealth of information about the various
definition of ideal cut round brilliant diamonds, most consumers
have no idea what constitutes great cut for the fancy cut
diamonds such as pear, heart, oval, marquise, princess, emerald
or radiant.  There is no one industry standard for round let
alone fancy cuts, but there are some specific guidelines that we
use when we search for diamond.

Each fancy shape has its own set of depth percentage, table
percentage, crown height percentage and length to width ratio
that will increase the likelihood that the diamond will have
great brilliance, sparkle and beauty.

If you are shopping for a fancy cut diamond and are interested
what specifications define the top cut class for that shape,
give us a call and we will be happy to discuss this with you.

Beauty meets the bulletproof vest in a gown designed for Miss
Israel to wear at the Miss Universe pageant next month.  The
top of the silk dress, embroidered with diamonds and pearls,
is covered by an army-issue flak jacket adorned with diamonds
for a so-called softer look, the Associated Press reported.

The dress sends a message that everyday life should go on
despite renewed violence, its designer said.  ``I want people
in Israel to continue to go out,'' said Galit Levi, a Tel Aviv
fashion designer. ``But be careful.''

Levi also designed two prior Miss Universe dresses. In 1998,
her design featured the faces of Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat
and Bill Clinton, leaders known for Middle East peace efforts.
In 1999, the first Arab Miss Israel, Rana Raslan, wore a dress
with a large red Star of David, an Israeli symbol.

Ilanit Levy, an 18-year-old soldier from Haifa, will wear the
bulletproof dress in the Miss Universe competition May 11 in

$500 MILLION HEIST FOILED IN LONDON

Would-be thieves crashed a bulldozer into London's Millennium
Dome on Nov. 7, hoping to snatch $500 million worth of
diamonds=01*including the spectacular 203-ct. De Beers Millennium
Star. The robbers planned to make their getaway in a speedboat
waiting on the Thames River. It would have been the world's
largest robbery, but the diamonds were already gone from
their tented exhibition arena, and Scotland Yard was waiting.
Officers disguised as cleaners overpowered the robbers, and a
dozen men were arrested without a shot fired.

Tipped off by police, dome officials had replaced the gems
with crystal fakes. De Beers officials say the pear-shaped
Millennium Star is arguably the most perfect large diamond in
the world.

Four men were arrested after trapping themselves in the vault
that usually houses the diamonds. Police picked up another
near a speedboat on the river, and a sixth man on the opposite
shore. Six others were apprehended later in southeastern
England.

Representatives of the New Millennium Experience Co., which
operates the dome, said the diamonds are displayed in an
exhibition area of the facility called the ""money zone"" and
are closely guarded. The Millennium Star is displayed in a
reinforced glass cylinder, and the area has alarms and
security cameras. The collection also features 11 large
diamonds of a distinctive vivid blue color.

Police said the robbers, apparently disguised as workmen,
crashed through a perimeter fence and drove the bulldozer
past security guards at around 9:30 a.m., shortly after the
attraction opened for the day. As they entered the building,
they donned gas masks before unleashing smoke bombs.
Fortunately, none of the estimated 100 visitors in the tent
were nearby.

Disguised police were positioned around the inside of the
dome. After the robbers went into the vaults and became
trapped, they were ordered to come out at gunpoint by the
officers. The intruders were captured as they bashed at the
display cases with hammers and sledgehammers.

For the past ten years, platinum prices have fluctuated
between $350-$450 per troy ounce on the commodity markets.
In the second half of 1999 the prices start a climb that
saw prices move from $350 to almost $650 per ounce at the
start of this year.  This increase is mostly due to the
big increase in demand in platinum jewelry while supplies
have not been able to keep up.  Check out the price chart
at http://futures.tradingcharts.com/prairielinks/PL/M
that plots this trend.  Note how there are some weeks
where the price has $100 swings.

The impact on you the consumer is two fold, the prices you
pay today are almost twice what they were a year ago and
the supply of parts for mountings and jewelry can sometimes
take weeks to restock.  The other impact is that if you
bought jewelry with significant platinum content, it is
now worth more and would cost more to replace.  If your
appraisal is more than one year old, you might want to
consider having it reappraised for insurance purposes.


CLARITY GRADING
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Undoubtedly, size is an important factor in determining
the clarity grade.  The more difficult it is to see an
inclusion, particularly face-up, the less it will
influence the clarity grade.

Almost as a part of size, the number of inclusions must
be considered.  Clarity grading does not, however, consist
of merely counting inclusions, but rather judging how
readily that number can be seen.  A stone could, for
example, have a number of minute pinpoints and still be
graded high on the scale.  Usually one or two of the
largest inclusions will establish the grade.  Additional
inclusions, if small or minute, will have little or no
effect on the grade.

The position of an inclusion affects how readily it can be
seen.  Cutters call the area seen through the table the
""heart"" of the stone and make every effort to orient rough
stones so that inclusions are not visible through the
table of the finished stone.  The preferred position for
inclusions is under the bezel facets or near the girdle
because they are less noticeable there.

Sometimes inclusions are located where they cause
multiple reflections in the pavilion facets when you look
at the stone in the face-up position.  Such reflectors
lower the clarity grade more than similar non-reflecting
inclusions.

The type of inclusion can sometimes influence the clarity
grade.  Most inclusions do not threaten a diamond's
durability.  Remember, long before a stone ever reaches
the consumer, it has already been subjected to considerable
heat and stress in both the cutting and manufacturing
processes. It is unlikely to get rougher treatment simply
by being worn.  But large cleavages or feathers,
particularly when they reach the table or extend from the
crown through the girdle, are potentially hazardous since
they could be extended by a severe blow.

Most inclusions are white or colorless, but sometimes
they are black, brown, dark red, or green.  These, or
course, are easier to see and lower the clarity grade more
than a colorless inclusion.  However, curiously enough,
a dark inclusion dead center under the table is often
surprisingly inconspicuous.

Most inclusions have little impact on the beauty of the
diamond since they are not visible with the naked eye.
The high price associated with high clarity has more to
do with rarity than beauty.  If most diamonds were flawless,
it is likely that included diamonds would command the
greatest interest and price.


OCTAHEDRON

The octahedron is the most common form of gem quality
diamond crystals.  The octahedron is shaped like two
pyramids, one upside down and fastened at the bases.
Perfectly formed octahedrons, called glassies, are among
the most striking of all mineral crystals.  Rough crystals
with this shape are well suited to be cut into the popular
round and princess shapes.


WHERE DIAMONDS FORM

Diamonds form only under certain chemical, temperature,
and pressure conditions.  Scientists estimate that the
necessary conditions of temperature and pressure can exist
in parts of the Earth's mantle (inside the crust) between
75 and 120 miles beneath the Earth's surface.

Almost all diamonds are carried to the surface by a specific
type of peridotite rock called kimberlite.  The Australian
diamonds were carried by a similar type of rock called
lamproite.  For billions of years, kimberlites have
periodically carried diamonds to the Earth's surface.

We call diamond deposits in kimberlite pipes primary
deposits.  The kimberlite itself is not very tough so it
breaks down with sunlight, heat and cold, wind and rain, and
other environmental forces.  The diamonds often get washed
out of the pipe and into the beds of rivers where they
gather in potholes and eddies. These are called alluvial
deposits.  If the river currents are strong enough, they
may carry their diamonds all the way to the sea.  There
the stones either settle to the bottom or are washed back
onto the beach.  These diamond rich areas are called
marine deposits.  Diamonds found in alluvial and marine
deposits and in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks are said
to be from secondary deposits.

An issue surfaced during the conduct of the current Spring 2001
TCC Auction related to import limit to New York from Hydro
Quebec (HQ) .  In one round of the Spring auction, bids were
received requesting a large number of TCCs with a POI of the
HQ Proxy bus.  These bids, if awarded, would exceed the HQ
import limit of 1200 MW used in the TCC auctions.

The 1200 MW HQ import limit was based on internal conversations
within the NYISO.  These conversations indicated that congestion
differences between the HQ Proxy bus and internal New York buses
would be produced in SCUC at the 1200 MW import level.  One
auction participant questioned the modeling of the HQ import limit.
After further review, the NYSIO agreed that the HQ import limit used
in the TCC auctions could be increased to 1500 MW, as long as
the same SCUC operating policy for the HQ import was followed.
This policy allows for a 1500 MW HQ import, if at least 300 MW of
that import is due to wheel through transactions.

The ISO will implement this operating policy in the TCC auction as
follows.  TCC awarded from the HQ Proxy bus to internal New York
buses will be limited to 1200 MW.  Total TCC awards from the HQ
Proxy bus will be limited to 1500 MW.  TCCs awarded in the reverse
direction (i.e., into the HQ Proxy bus) will net against those TCCs
awarded in the opposite direction.  Also, existing uses of the
transmission system will be included.  Existing uses include
Grandfathered Rights, Grandfathered TCCs and TCCs awarded
in previous auctions that have not expired.

To incorporate this operating policy in subsequent TCC auctions,
the following bidding rule is being established:

For TCC bids from the HQ Proxy bus to an internal New York bus or
zone and from an internal New York bus or zone to the HQ Proxy bus,
PTID 61844 must be used for the POI or POW as appropriate.

For TCC bids that represent wheels through from the HQ Proxy bus to
another external proxy bus (i.e., NE Proxy, OH Proxy, PJM Proxy) and
from another external proxy bus to the HQ Proxy bus, PTID 23651 must
be used as the POI or POW as appropriate.

These PTID designations will allow the NYISO to identify TCC bids and
properly model those bids as they relate to the Hydro Quebec import
limit in the TCC auction.

PTIDs 61844 and 23651 were chosen because the LBMPs and the
individual components of the LBMPs in the Day-Ahead market are identical.

This new bidding opportunity in the TCC auctions will be allowed
beginning with the May 2001 Reconfiguration Auction scheduled for
April 23, 2001.

To answer your question - bid cost guarantees should be entered by you, Larry 
or Narsimha as soon as you calculate them.  I will watch them periodically 
throughout the month to be sure you are calculating them correctly.  Any time 
you have a question about what NY is showing just ask.

Here is the reconciliation for April to date.  Could you please take a look 
at your calculations for 4/5, 4/6, 4/10, 4/15 & 4/16 - the variances are 
quite large.
If you want details just ask.

the positives and negatives.  The positives being the information which Steve 
and company will collect.  This appears to be a  very useful tool.  There is 
also is no permit emission limits associated with the permit at this 
facility.  There also exists the potential to pay lower emissions fees should 
this investigation show that the emissions from the units to be significantly 
lower than what was placed into the permit application.  The downside to this 
effort is that the data we collect may in fact show that our emissions fees 
which we have been paying actually under estimate those submitted in our 
application and we would more than likely be held accountable for the 
difference (1996 to the present).  Additionally, enforcement action could 
result by the Navajos.  I say this to apprise everyone of the positive and 
negative potentials involved in completing this study.  From the emission 
estimates which were placed into the permit application we included a 
defendable buffer or excess of emissions to account for variations in the 
temperature, humidity, engine age and poor engine mechanics should they 
exist.  

And finally, we have the unknown of not knowing what the three units actually 
emit.  These units have never been tested.  This uncertanty in itself may be 
the driver to know so as not to have a situation which was similar to what 
happened at Atoka No. 3 several months ago.

To Market Participants:

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO will premier its

? new website design. The visual
presentation of the site is
being refreshed to convey a bold presence on the Internet and present a clear,
consistent, hi-tech look and
feel to the site. This represents the completion of phase I of the web refresh
project and is part of the
NYISO Strategic Initiatives.

For a period of two weeks (until May 8, 2001), both the new and old websites
will be operated in parallel.
On May 8, 2001 (unless notified differently), the old site will be 
discontinued.
The NYISO has planned
the transition to be as seamless as possible for our Market Participants and
Guests.

Several paths are available to access the new site. Direct links will be 
placed
on the NYISO home page
and on the What?s New page under Hot Topics. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE BOOKMARKS OR
SCRIPT FILES!!!!!!!!!!!! Once the transition period is ended, the NYISO will
rename the server
containing the new website to the address of the old website. With this plan,
Users will NOT be required
to modify bookmarks and/or script files.

The URL addresses for the MIS portion of the web site, the billing statements,
and the LBMP data HAVE
NOT and WILL NOT change. Access to these areas of the site will not change and
Users will not need to
modify any procedures.

What Users can expect to see is consistent fonts, style rules, symbols, 
colors,
etc. This will enhance
navigation and improve the functionality of the site. Phase II of this project
will address site architecture,
file structure, and make substantial improvements to site navigation and data
content. Information
gathered from onsite interviews with Market Participants from each sector will
be used in the
implementation of Phase II changes.

Market Participants should contact their Customer Relations Representative if
they have any questions,

story 

Pollution Rules Tighten Squeeze on Power Supply 


By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer 


???? SACRAMENTO--California's already severe electricity squeeze could 
tighten further this summer if regulators don't ease up on air pollution 
rules, power company officials said Friday. 
???? The state's 1,000 power plants--many aging and burning natural 
gas--have been running so hard and long in this summer of electricity 
scarcity that many are close to spewing as much pollution as they are 
allowed for the year under their permits. 
???? Without flexibility from air pollution regulators, the plants could 
be forced to shut down or face fines. This summer California cannot 
afford the loss of any of those plants at times of peak demand, said the 
state's last-resort buyer of electricity. 
???? ""I can't tell you whether we are in big trouble or medium trouble,"" 
said Terry Winter, who oversees the nonprofit agency that buys 
last-minute supplies when electricity consumption spikes so high that it 
threatens to disrupt the state's high-voltage grid. 
???? ""If it stays really hot and we've got to run every unit,"" said 
Winter, ""then we've got a problem. If it cools off a little bit, we 
could turn off those units exceeding their permits and we won't have a 
problem at all. My sense is, by late August we'll be seeing the problem 
more severely. But we're working on it."" 
???? Local and state air pollution regulators say they recognize the 
problem and will do their best to help avoid outages. 
???? ""I was flying by the seat of my pants,"" said Richard Baldwin, head 
of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, who hurriedly 
struck a deal last week to keep a gas-fired turbine running on the 
Ventura County coast. The plant, which would have otherwise been shut 
down for the rest of the year because of air pollution rules, is owned 
by Houston-based Reliant Energy, one of the major players in 
California's recently deregulated electricity market. 
???? Under the deal, Reliant will pay the air district $4,000 for every 
hour it runs the relatively dirty plant the rest of the year. The money 
will go toward replacement of heavily polluting diesel engines. 
???? The agreement means that California's grid operators can now count 
on the plant to produce enough electricity to supply 125,000 homes. On a 
hot day in late July they desperately needed that electricity, but could 
not get it because Reliant's air pollution permit allowed 100 hours of 
operation each year and only five remained. 
???? ""Those air quality districts could just throw up their hands and 
say no, not our problem,"" said Winter, executive director of the 
California Independent System Operator, the nonprofit entity that runs 
most of California's electric grid, ""but they have all been very 
responsive."" 
???? He said his Folsom-based staff foresaw the problem and has been 
talking with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California 
Air Resources Board and the local air districts that set pollution 
limits for individual power plants. 
???? ""They have been very, very cooperative in trying to figure out ways 
to allow us to continue to generate but at the same time not add more 
pollutants to the air,"" he said. One way to do that, Winter said, may be 
to not run power plants in the evenings, when demand dips. 
???? ""We don't want to put the lights out in the state,"" said Bill 
Kelly, spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
which issued a letter to power producers two weeks ago warning that many 
will soon bump against their air pollution limits. 
???? ""We asked them, if they're going to be above their caps, to come in 
and work with us on compliance plans,"" Kelly said. ""These plans would be 
developed through public hearings."" 
???? What can be done will vary with every plant in the state, said V. 
John White, who sits on the Cal-ISO board and directs the Center for 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies in Sacramento. 
???? Air quality will not suffer significantly, White said, ""with some 
creative application of rules and the principle that you've got to pay 
for the pollution somehow."" 
???? The root of the current conflict between air pollution and energy 
production lies with California's failure in the last 10 years to build 
any major power plants. Demand for electricity in the state's humming 
economy has soared higher than anyone anticipated, while new supplies 
are not expected to reach the grid for at least a year. 
???? Several times this summer, grid operators have had to frantically 
purchase electricity elsewhere in the West to save the state from 
outages that can endanger lives and cost high-tech companies as much as 
$30 million a day in lost production. 
???? The shortage of electricity compromises air quality. When 
businesses voluntarily disconnect from the grid at times of highest 
demand, they often turn on diesel generators to maintain computer and 
phone systems. Such generators spew toxic air contaminants, particulates 
and higher levels of nitrogen oxides than most power plants. 
???? The tight supplies this summer also mean that California's old, 
inefficient power plants are running harder than ever and those built 
just for backup are running steadily. 
???? Duke Energy's power plant in Oakland helped keep lights on in the 
city after a disastrous 1989 earthquake. Typically, the costly plant 
operated 30 to 50 hours a year; its air pollution permit allows no more 
than 870 hours annually. So far this year, said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams, the plant has run more than 500 hours. 
???? ""The turbines date to late 1970s,"" he said. ""They're being called 
on more and more."" 
???? North Carolina-based Duke purchased or leased several major power 
plants from utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego 
Gas & Electric after the Legislature deregulated the state's electricity 
market in 1996. 
???? One plant, in Chula Vista, generates enough electricity for 700,000 
homes in San Diego, where transmission problems leave the city 
especially vulnerable to power sags and surges. 
???? That plant is rapidly approaching its limit on nitrogen oxide 
pollutants, Williams said. ""We're evaluating our options about how to 
address this problem.""

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage excelr's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for excelr travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from excelr's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for excelr 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of excelr 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the excelr Travel Program intranet @ gss.excelr.com <http://gss.excelr.com/>.

the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

  NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI,
respectively.

 While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter  requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that  having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


  NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

I agree with Mark. Further, in setting the baseline, the LOLP study
obviously assumed an annual structure for maintenance scheduling and a lack
of diversity in terms of outage rates for summer versus winter. These
assumptions no longer are valid if the time step for planning becomes a
capability period. Each reliability period would have to stand on its own,
and you would have to entirely redo the assumptions about scheduled outages
and come up with seasonal availabilities. My guess is that given the
incentive to be around in the summer for the higher energy payments, these
values should be highly skewed.

Finally, lets also just cut to the chase. Even if this study were correct in
its current form, what obviously is going on is an attempt to ""evade"" 50% of
the deficiency charge. Applying this type of argument on seasonal installed
requirement to deficiency payments just doesn't fly. If you believe that the
current values for the deficiency payments are ""correct"" to begin with, it
would make sense to me to at minimum allocate the deficiency charges by the
LOLP incurrence, e.g. if 90% of the annual LOLP is in the summer period,
then 90% of the deficiency should probably follow this allocation. Remember,
the incentive is to force people to build, the cost of being short ever
really should stay the same, or you diminish the incentive and thus undercut
the entire reliability structure.

the ICAP market.  If we are going to consider a change in this direction
then we also have to apply most of the annual deficiency rate to the summer
period.

Subject:        NYPA study-Winter Locational ICAP requirements

<< File: NYPA_LR_wint.PDF >>  << File: TRAN_SYS_001129.PDF >>          At
NYPA's
request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the
locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and Long Island,
respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter ratings on the
transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how much the 80% and
98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the statewide Loss
Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter requirements of 75% and
92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI, respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational
requirements, the results from this study suggest that some reduction in the
winter  requirement may be warranted and a consideration of seasonal
requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP requirement studies.
NYPA believes that having an ICAP requirement for summer and winter seasons
based on the LSE's peak load for the respective season would send the proper
ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to
begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination of
locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In response to some E-mails on the subject report we offer the following
comments.  We believe expressing the locational requirement as a function of
the capability period peak sends a better price signal to LSE's.  Some LSE
loads will have larger peak in summer and others may be balanced or even
peak in the winter.  Seasonal ICAP would facilitate capacity exchanges
between summer and winter peaking areas.

As a practical matter the requirement can be expressed any way.   For this
exercise we just left it as a percentage of the summer peak because it
provides a reference point to the current requirement and illustrates an
order of magnitude of the potential reduction in the winter requirement that
may be justified through an examination of the seasonal risk.   We agree
completely that all issues, including deficiency charges, modeling, etc.,
must be considered in any methodological change.  There was no intent to
suggest everything else would remain unchanged.",Non Abusive

purpose of relating some information I have received from Rod Boshcee of 
PG&E.  The conference number is 1-800-991-9019, passcode 6000796.  Rod left a 
very friendly detailed message on my voice mail yesterday afternoon related 
to the upcoming proposed shutdown and testing of the separators at Topock 
(which they previously agreed would be done around September 11 or 12.  He 
asked on the voice mail that I give him a call back and let him know what our 
decision is as soon as possible.

The following will attempt to summarize his voice mail message and will be 
the subject of our call today:
Rod stated that when we were together at Flagstaff in July we had decided to 
again take the system down and sample the separators around September 11 and 
12.
He said PG&E has continued to monitor their unit and have found nothing new 
since the June 29 test.
Rod also said that they have gotten consistent numbers downstream since June 
29 and everything seems stabilized.
He said that PG&E is ""happy"" with the operation of the separators and they 
seem to be doing the job that TW had said they would do.
Rod said that PG&E would go along with TW's thoughts on it, but they were 
wondering if it was really necessary to take the system down in mid-September 
or not since things were looking good?  He said they could go either way on 
it.
Rod closed by saying that they still had some concern about the sterility of 
the 1800' of pipe that connects TW's Meter Run with PG&E's Topock Compressor 
Station.  However, it seemed to be OK for now and they would have no other 
thoughts on it as long as the numbers stay consistently low on their side.
He asked that we let him know what we want to do as soon as possible so 
scheduling will not be a problem.

I would propose that we discuss this matter and then we can call him back and 
furnish our recommendation.  The cooperative tone of his call is something we 
want to continue to build upon and I do want us to be promptly responsive in 
that regard.  Thanks, John",Non Abusive

placed a call to Rod Boschee and we discussed the following items.  One of 
the key points Rod made is summarized at bullet four below.  Evidently, they 
want to take the maximum amount of gas from us for as long as they can.

We appreciated his phone call and the cooperative effort that was working 
well.  I told Rod that we were also very pleased with the results experienced 
since the June 29 cleaning and testing of the separators.  As far as we knew 
TW's system was staying dry and we were moving no significant liquids into 
their separator.
TW would go along with PG&E and agree that we would not take the system down 
in mid-September to re-check the separators at this point since we were not 
seeing any alarming numbers or quantities.
In place of taking the system down in mid-September, TW and PG&E would watch 
for an upset and a large quantity or a higher concentration - if that occurs, 
then we would immediately get together and plan a time to take the system 
down and check things out.
PG&E is requesting that TW keep flow rates up the rest of the summer, all 
fall and into the winter.  PG&E might want us to take the system down and 
check the separators sometime next year - but they want to talk about going 
as long as we can before we do that.  
Rod agreed that we would still meet as planned in October in Las Vegas.  
(Caveat:  Because of all of the EOTT things going on and other related 
issues, it would help my schedule greatly if we could shift that proposed 
meeting from October 10 to anytime the week of October 16 or October 23?  I 
would appreciate it if Mike Nelson or David Roensch could arrange the meeting 
to be delayed a week or so).  The agenda for the meeting would be related to 
updating everyone on testing results, scheduling the down-time at a mutually 
agreeable time next year for checking the separators, build-out of certain 
facilities on their system related to receiving TW's gas, etc.   
We would agree to do nothing about the 1800' of interconnecting pipe at this 
point.

As a separate item to the concerns I had about the technical content, I was
a little confused on what was done here administratively. The last paragraph
says something about NYPA sharing the study. I didn't think they had
anything at all to say about it in the first place if it is an ISO work
product. If they do, could you explain why this is the case? If the ISO did
this, why wasn't this all posted on the OASIS at the same time NYPA got
this? The date on this shows a March 26 release.  Ignore these comments if
this was done, but I wasn't aware of this.

I am more than a little uncomfortable with a single market participant
having a month's lead time on ISO studies that can have significant
commercial impact. Think about the implications of this in the context of
people negotiating long term bi lateral ICAP agreements over the last month.
Depending on your take on the type of market changes that this type of
analysis might support, there could be enormous changes to the economics of
seasonal versus annual agreements, choice of equipment etc. This simply
isn't fair. Even if posted, this type of work by the ISO that can have large
potential commercial impacts should go out on all of the distributions at
the same time as release to anyone and OASIS posting.

Subject: NYPA study-Winter Locational ICAP requirements

At NYPA's request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI,
respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter         requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that       having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

that things get posted and provided to everyone at the same time for all of

I would like to pay the NYISO to conduct a study for me on the price impact
of the transmission outages planned each day.  Since I would be paying for
this, I wouldof course be entitled to get the results one day in advance of
all other market participants.  The ISO would of course be free to release
the results to the rest of the marketplace just following the release of
the day ahead results each day.  This would ultimately be in the best
interests of the marketplace since I would immediately arbitrage the daily
market to the correct prices and thereby increase efficiency.  Upon review,
all would be amazed at just how efficient the marketplace has become based
upon how accurate it was at predicting settlement prices.

On April 4, 2001, we issued a memorandum which included information from
EPA regarding the Agency=01,s current thinking on the draft MACT standards =
for
IC engines and combustion turbines located at major sources of HAP
emissions (see Attachment A of attached file).  Since the distribution of
that memorandum, EPA has provided corrections regarding the compliance
monitoring requirements for the IC Engine MACTs.  The MACT information
provided by EPA, including the latest corrections regarding compliance
monitoring are included in this memorandum.  Clearly, this is preliminary
information and should not be construed as the content of the final rules.
This content could change before these rules are submitted to OMB,
subsequently issued as proposed standards, or promulgated as final rules.

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the public web server (www.nyiso.com), MIS and
SPIDER that will be implemented on May, 01, 2001.
:

*  The software required to implement the Automated Mitigation
Process (AMP) will be deployed to the MIS and SPIDER systems. The
Automated Mitigation Process is the automation of existing market
mitigation procedures for the proactive mitigation of energy
suppliers who are about to exercise market power with a subsequent
price impact.  Activation of the software is pending.

*  A new version of the Moving Range Chart web application will be
deployed (Originally scheduled April 24th , 2001).

*  The process to generate all the files posted for real-time LBMP
data to the NYISO web site (OASIS) will be changed to use XML
technology in order create the files faster, neater and more
reliably. The files Market Participants use in the OASIS will not
change.  Previously a product called InfoReports was used to
generate those web postings.

Changes #: KKIR-4VQSTF; RMUY-4VPRUZ; VLEE-4VQPHQ; MDSO-4VPSM6

If you notice any NYISO systems behave other than intended after
the scheduled implementation date, please let us know immediately.

It will be helpful if you refer to this notice if you communicate
with us about these changes.

This raises concerns about what functions any ISO should take on in the
long run.  Here the ISO used its limited resources, ones which many members
want directed to specific high priority projects... such as virtual
bidding, to perform a study on ICAP that we did not know about until a
flurry of emails arrive.  The point is, the ISO better serves by focusing
its talent and limited time on facilitating the operation of a workable,
reliable, cost effective and efficient power market and by performing
studies consistent with member priorities.  Not by performing studies at
the request of one member, unless they are part of a clearly defined and
approved process like that for interconnections.  The ISO should work as a
""market facilitator,"" and as such expend its talents on providing accurate
and timely pricing, billing, and tracking of energy transactions within,
into, and out of New York.

The NYISO's need to periodically address market reliability issues and to
initiate studies should continue, in the near term.   Market participants
can raise concerns about reliability issues or submit studies they perform
to the ISO and if the ISO believes that they have merit, we can all review
and debate them and not be advantaged or disadvantaged by some activities
that the ISO decided to undertake with one member.  The ISO should not
pirate market participants' opportunities to analyze the dynamics of
generation availability, transmission, ICAP, and demand to discover areas
for investment.

What better stimulus than ROI is there to seek out opportunities and
eradicate inefficiencies in the market?  Let the market work, and the ISO
facilitate.

Dear Market Participants,

As many of you know, and as some of you have commented about, the
ISO performed additional computer analysis regarding locational ICAP
requirements at NYPA's request early this year.  We did so after
agreeing that the issue NYPA raised was relevant to our market and
would not detract from other work we were conducting.  The results
were shared with NYPA in March with the understanding that NYPA
would use the study results to promote a dialogue among Market
Participants on the issues raised.

The NYISO would like to formalize the process of contract work on
issues relevant to the New York market, or decide to discontinue it,
by reviewing with Market Participants a proposed protocol indicating
appropriate areas for study and appropriate disclosure guidelines.
We will request the Operating, Business Issues and Management
Committee Chairs to add this proposed protocol, for discussion, to
committee agendas for May.   We look forward to working with all
Market Participants on reaching agreement on an acceptable process
that is both useful and fair to everyone.

Regards,

Mollie Lampi,
NYISO Senior Attorney

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Chuck, please see that this gets on the appropriate distributions lists, TIE
and BIC.

In thinking over the discussions at the BIC meeting I found two areas
related to interactions with PJM where I am a bit confused due to what is
either my misunderstanding, or conflicting information provided by NY and
PJM. I would appreciate it if the NYISO would clarify these items. I will
also make a similar request of PJM.

1) Common interface tool.

My understand from the PJM EMC meeting was that PJM was going basically do
this entirely (or almost entirely) on their own, and just allocate some
costs between NY and PJM. The product as I understood it would be available
to participants of both pools for transactions scheduling. The users would
input to the tool, and NY and PJM would basically get screened/coordinated
input simultaneously in order to accelerate scheduling and minimize checkout
problems etc.

If this was the case, I don't understand the comments at the BIC that NY
wont be able to do this by the summer. Is this a PJM or NY constraint? Is
PJM unable to complete what they offered? I can understand that that would
hold things up as they proposed to do most of the work. However at the PJM
EMC I got the impression that PJM was all set to go, could make the
schedule, and just needed NY agreement. If this is a NY constraint I would
also like to know more about it.

Can you please clarify what is going on here?

2) Inter ISO Congestion Pilot. I was disappointed in the ""lukewarm""
presentation that Rick Gonzales made at the BIC. I realize that this program
is very limited in scope, but it seems to me this is a very important
precedent to the future coordination of the ISO's. As we left things it
seems likely that this will die in committee before the summer.

However, I would like a technical explanation of one of things that Rick
said. He commented that one of his discomforts related to a request by PJM
that NY pay for some generation in Northern New Jersey. At first blush this
got a very negative response in the group.

Then I started to think about this more. My understanding is the basic
structure of the agreement is that ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B
is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in A.  Thus if
PJM was suggesting NY pay for North Jersey generation, presumably this was
to be for PJM adding generation there to ease a NY constraint. Now I am not
a great electrical engineer, but my limited understanding of the systems
suggests to me that if PJM is adding generation in North Jersey to help NY,
this has to do with modification to the PAR flows and support of SENY
through the PSEG cable. Is this correct?

IF CORRECT, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE NYISO HAS REJECTED A PROPOSAL TO
INCREASE SUPPLIES TO SENY FOR THIS SUMMER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR
REDISPATCH IN PJM?

I hope that this is an incorrect conclusion, otherwise we have some big
problems.

I would appreciate a further explanation of this, as perhaps I don't
understand what is physically happening.

Roy,

Thanks for sharing your concerns regarding the MOU pilot programs.  I will
include below a portion of the draft minutes from the April 18th NYISO
Management Committee meeting which discuss the NYISO position on the CIT
project.  Initially, this project was viewed as a ""quick hit"" which could be
completed swiftly, at minimal cost, and with minimal impact on staff and 
ongoing
project work.  Further discussion with PJM reveals that this will not be the
case.

Question on CIT/CSS:

In thinking over the discussions at the BIC meeting I found two areas
related to interactions with PJM where I am a bit confused due to what is
either my misunderstanding, or conflicting information provided by NY and
PJM. I would appreciate it if the NYISO would clarify these items. I will
also make a similar request of PJM.

1) Common interface tool.

My understand from the PJM EMC meeting was that PJM was going basically do
this entirely (or almost entirely) on their own, and just allocate some
costs between NY and PJM. The product as I understood it would be available
to participants of both pools for transactions scheduling. The users would
input to the tool, and NY and PJM would basically get screened/coordinated
input simultaneously in order to accelerate scheduling and minimize checkout
problems etc.

If this was the case, I don't understand the comments at the BIC that NY
wont be able to do this by the summer. Is this a PJM or NY constraint? Is
PJM unable to complete what they offered? I can understand that that would
hold things up as they proposed to do most of the work. However at the PJM
EMC I got the impression that PJM was all set to go, could make the
schedule, and just needed NY agreement. If this is a NY constraint I would
also like to know more about it.

Can you please clarify what is going on here?

Response:

(Reported by Mr. Museler to the MC on 4-18-2001)

1.   There have been recent developments in the NYISO / PJM CIT process.  At 
the
present time, no software requirements document has been created, no vendor
contracts have been signed,  and a number of issues, including ensuring the
confidentiality of data, providing redundancy in New York in case the PJM 
based
system fails, and liability, all have to be resolved.

When the project was originally proposed, the NYISO believed it could be done
quickly with a limited amount of resources.  This has not proven to be the 
case.
Completing this project immediately  would take resources away from other
projects need for Summer 2001 and will have a budget impact of approximately 
$1
million.  The NYISO does not believe it would be prudent to allow this project
to come ahead of the Summer 2001 issues, or to proceed without vendor 
contracts
in place and other outstanding issues resolved.  The NYISO will continue work 
on
the CIT process and will keep the Committees informed of developments.

Question:

2) Inter ISO Congestion Pilot. I was disappointed in the ""lukewarm""
presentation that Rick Gonzales made at the BIC. I realize that this program
is very limited in scope, but it seems to me this is a very important
precedent to the future coordination of the ISO's. As we left things it
seems likely that this will die in committee before the summer.

However, I would like a technical explanation of one of things that Rick
said. He commented that one of his discomforts related to a request by PJM
that NY pay for some generation in Northern New Jersey. At first blush this
got a very negative response in the group.

Then I started to think about this more. My understanding is the basic
structure of the agreement is that ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B
is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in A.  Thus if
PJM was suggesting NY pay for North Jersey generation, presumably this was
to be for PJM adding generation there to ease a NY constraint. Now I am not
a great electrical engineer, but my limited understanding of the systems
suggests to me that if PJM is adding generation in North Jersey to help NY,
this has to do with modification to the PAR flows and support of SENY
through the PSEG cable. Is this correct?

IF CORRECT, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE NYISO HAS REJECTED A PROPOSAL TO
INCREASE SUPPLIES TO SENY FOR THIS SUMMER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR
REDISPATCH IN PJM?

I hope that this is an incorrect conclusion, otherwise we have some big
problems.

I would appreciate a further explanation of this, as perhaps I don't
understand what is physically happening.

Thanks for the help

Response:

With regard to the inter-ISO Congestion management pilot, Rick Gonzales offers
the following response to your comments:

2. Please be advised that the NYISO fully supports the Inter-regional 
Congestion
Pilot program. The Congestion Pilot will be presented again for comment at the
Market Structures WG for further discussion and to facilitate the potential
implementation of this program.

One of the major issues noted in the presentation that limits the extent to
which the Pilot program can be used is the potential for cost-shifting between
ISOs. In addition to providing a list of 'candidate' operational constraints, 
it
was also noted that it is the responsibility of each ISO to re-dispatch its
internal control area resources to solve its own internal constraints. This
concept is in agreement with your understanding that 'ISO A only makes 
payments
to ISO B if B is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in
A'.

Any futher conclusions that one might imply from the Inter-regional Congestion
Pilot should be discussed at the next Market Structures WG meeting.

C. King adds the following with regard to the notion of increasing supplies to
SENY and the operation of the PARs (Waldwick & Linden-Goethals/Hudson 
faragut):

Since the initiation of the NYISO Markets, the full capability of the
Hudson-Farragut PARs has not been available due to equipment failure.  The
equipment is expected to be back in service on or about the May-June period.  
In
preparation for the return of the outaged PAR to service, NYISO and PJM staff
have been discussing the operation of the PARs and the relationship of the PAR
schedules to the PSEG-Con Edison Energy Transfer Agreements which have long 
been
associated with this equipment.  It would be pre-mature to establish a
congestion-management pilot involving facilities in the electrical vicinity of
the PARs, until the operating procedures related to the operation of the PARs 
is
fully discussed and agreed to.
Both PJM & NYISO acknowledged this at the Stakeholder Meeting in Toronto 
earlier
this year, so this is nothing new.

Presently the equipment owners (PSEG & Con Edison) as well as NYISO and PJM 
are
engaged in discussions which should ultimately result in an operating 
agreement
between PJM and NYISO regarding the operation and scheduling of the PARs.
Progress is being made, thus I think that every effort is being made to insure
that energy can flow between PJM and SENY, and between NY and New Jersey for
this summer and beyond.  We appreciate your encouragement of these efforts and
other efforts to address seams issues in the northeast.

See you in Springfield next Wednesday!

Chuck

As a margin account holder, you know how important it is to receive 
information about your account in a quick and timely manner. One of 
the ways we notify customers about a margin call is with a letter, but 
unfortunately that letter often arrives too late for timely action. 
That's why we've decided to stop sending regular mail notification of 
margin calls to our customers. 

E-mail is the fastest way for us to notify you about a margin call. We 
will continue to provide you with speedy e-mail notification, and are 
committed to steadily improving our already top-rated e-mail service. 
Please check your inbox regularly and make sure that the e-mail 
address we have on file for your account is current. 

To update your e-mail address online, simply login to your account and 
select ""Settings"" from the Account Services pull-down menu. Then click 
""User Profile"" and follow the directions to modify your e-mail address. 

We'd like to remind you of your responsibility to remain aware of the 
status of your margin account at all times, and to be prepared to take 
action as soon as conditions warrant. Be fully aware that if at any 
time your account value falls to approximately 10% equity, or if 
market conditions warrant, we reserve the right to close out some or 
all of your positions with or without notice, at our sole discretion. 
For these reasons it is imperative that you monitor your account on a 
regular basis. 

If you have any questions please send e-mail to support@datek.com or

diligence which was performed on the Texas Panhandle and Cortez, Colorado 
portions of Equilon pipline system for which EOTT may be interested in 
purchasing.  This memo presents those environmental issues which may be or 
were identified as a potential environmental concern.  

Lefors (Texas Panhandle Segment)

Assets on this portion of the system which may have environmental  issues 
were the following:  1-80,000 bbl. liquids product storage tank, 41 small 
tank batteries consisting of 1-3 product storage tanks each.  Average tank 
size is 210 bbl.  Approximately 15 tank locations are within 1/4 mile of an 
existing waterway.  There are stream and river crossings included in this 
package.  The pipeline crossings viewed appeared to have sufficient  soil 
coverage and did have block valves on the upstream and downstream portions of 
the pipeline crossings.  

1. Clean Air Act.  There were no records kept at any office or location which 
would assist in the determination of compliance with Title III, or Title V.  
The  following documents were not present:  emissions inventories and or 
records of fees paid, O&G MACT compliance (HAP's),  operating permits.  NSPS  
Supart Kb compliance could not be determined also.  The 80,000 bbl tank 
construction date was in the 1930's and has a fixed roof.  It has a concrete  
bottom and the  tank has never been emptied for inspection.  No  Railroad 
Commission 653 inspection has ever been conducted.

2. Clean Water Act.  Although soil berm and containments were present around 
all tanks that were inspected, SPCC plans were not available at any 
location.   Interviews with the Equilon personnel stated that there had never 
been a reportable release from this tank.  In addition, location Texaco MB  
Davis pump  station had a small 3'x4' UST which received liquids from leaking 
packing material which had overflowed and visible soil staining was present.  
At this  location a T-stand pipe had been constructed into the soil berm to 
allow discharge of rainwater from the containment area.  This water 
discharged into  an ephermal arroyo which ultimately collects into the North 
Fork of the Red River, a perennial stream.

3. NESHAPS.  At the Lefors Station, there exists several joints of new and 
used pipe which is suspected of having external coating and pipe wrapping   
containing asbestos.

4. NORMS.  A NORM survey has not been conducted on any portion of the assets 
which are identified in the bid package.

5. Soil Staining.   There was minor soil staining at all locations inspected.

6. There is one active groundwater remediation in progress identified as the 
""10 mile hole"".  Equilon will retain ownership of this issue.  There had been 
two  pipeline remediation projects for which Equilon had reported to the TRRC 
and had remediated the site.

7. TSCA.  One electrical transformer was discovered at the Lefors Station.   
It had been tested and determined to not have PCB's.

8. Safe Drinking Water Act.  There was an abandoned drinking water well at 
the Lefors Station.  It had not been in service for an undetermined period of 
time. 

9. RCRA.  There was an abandoned out of service Fox boro meter at the Lefors 
Station.  Status of the potential releases of mercury could not be visibally  
determined.

Bug-Patterson Gathering System (Cortez, Colorado)

This system includes the following:

 Lady Bug Station  minor incidental equipment at this location. 

1. There were no environmental issues at this site from assets owned by 
Equilon.  Adjacent to this site was a producer site which had been blowing   
hydrocarbon liquids into an earthern unlined pit.  There was historic use of 
this pit.  Although surface contamination from this pit was present, it was 
not  known whether subsurface soil and groundwater conditions underlying the 
Equilon assets had been impacted.

compliance (HAP's),  operating or construction permits.  NSPS subpart Kb   
compliance could not be determined.   Determination of the permitting status 
for the six cylinder Waukesha could not be determined. 

2. Clean Water Act.  Although soil berm and containments were present, an 
SPCC plan was not available at this location.  Interviews with the Equilon   
personnel stated that there had never been a reportable release from this 
tank.  Rainwater which collected into the containment was discharged into an  
ephermal arroyo by a pipe constructed into and through the dirt containment.

3. NORMS.  A NORM survey has not been conducted on any portion of the assets 
which are identified in the bid package.

4. Minor soil staining was present around the 10,000 bbl tank.

5. Adjacent to this site was a producer site which had been blowing

Dear Market Participants,

With regard to a prior posting of Changes to OASIS/MIS/CSS Systems
(please refer to original at bottom) implementation of the item:

*  A new internal application for Operations to manage units
placed out of merit will improve coordination between Operations
and Grid Accounting for the purposes of accurate billing.

caused some visible changes in the MIS web pages
that were not explained in the original notice.

The screens which have changed are:

- Gen Bid Query Page - New value of 'MODIFIED' in the Bid Status
dropdown.  This will allow a user to select only bids that have a
status of 'MODIFIED'.

- Gen Bid Query Results Page - The status for a particular bid may
have a value of 'MODIFIED'.  Clicking on the bid status link will
list a message page with more information about the meaning of the
status.

- Gen Bid Page - The schedule information at the bottom of the page
may list a bid status of 'MODIFIED'.

- Gen Outage Page - Once fixed, the outage information will be
listed on an hourly basis since the outage information is now tied
to the bids.

- For the upload/download, the templates for submission and results
have not changed.  Retrieval of generator bids may have some
records with a bid status of 'MODIFIED', along with a message tied
to the meaning of the status.  The outage schedule information
(once fixed) will have the information listed on an hourly basis.

All of these screens have not changed in terms of layout or
functionality, etc.  There are just new possible values for some
of the query parameters and query results.

Thank you,
Customer Relations

fuel mixers with carbuerators at  the Spraberry Plant.  It seems that this 
replacement was performed ONLY as a fuel savings activity and that there 
would be no increase in emissions or horsepower as a result.  According to 
the TNRCC, they will allow this activity provided that the above is true and 
that we prove that emissions and horsepower will not increase.  To do this 
they have requested that we conduct an emissions test on one of the units 
with the mixer on and then with the carbuerator on as a condition of their 
approval.  IE before and after testing.  I am going to request that we be 
allowed to do the testing with a portable emissions tester, which has been 
verified in side by side testing on New Mexico units as opposed to bringing 
in a third party referenced testing company.  Contractor testing runs about 
$3-5,000.  

A condition of all permitting issues is that the carbs are not supposed to be 
installed on the units (preconstruction) until approval has been given by the 
agency.  In this case, we will be allowed to install a carbuerator on the one 
unit to be tested but not on all units.  Should testing show other 
exceedances (emissions or Hp) in addition to fuel savings, this will trigger 
actions requiring perimtting.  Under the circumstances, I think it would be 
in the best interest of NNG to know for certain that we have not violated the 
grandfather status of the units and that if our activity requires permitting, 
we comply immediately.

I am sending out the letter request to the TNRCC today.  If approved, we 
should test ASAP.  Remember, that sampling ports in the exhaust stack of the 
unit to be tested will need to be constructed prior to testing.  Let me know 
if the Team will need a diagram showing the sampling port locations.",Non Abusive

			How 'Bout Some Tonic With That Gin?
			The game of Gin was Hollywood's game. When it stormed through that town in 
the '40s, you could see Gin being played on the silver screen by all types of 
movie stars. Refined in the early 1900s at the Knickerbocker Whist Club in 
New York, Gin is the perfect social card game. It's not so strategic as to 
preclude chatting, but it still provides real competitive kick and a gleeful 
way to gloat when the cards are laid down, and ""Gin"" is scored. Not every 
online gaming site has Gin. But it's taking off on PlaySite. Take a break 
from your day and try it!

			Tournament Time
			What better way to test your gaming skills than to compete in an online 
tournament with other top-ranked competitors? PlaySite offers automatically 
scheduled tournaments in seven games: Backgammon, Checkers, Chess, Go-Moku, 
Hex, Mancala and Reversi. Some games have tournaments geared for the 
beginning player. Backgammon has tournaments for those rated Under 1500 and 
an Open class. Checkers and Chess both have tournaments for those rated Under 
1300 and a separate Open class. 
			
			Playing in a tournament is easy and fun. Go to your favorite game page, and 
click to enter the tournament room. You'll see areas for tournament info, 
signups, games, a history of prior tournaments and a schedule for upcoming 
tournaments. PlaySite tourneys run throughout the day. Get a complete look at

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO has chosen $150 as representative of a level to trigger market
mitigation. I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price
that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of $50.
A 300% increase or an increase of $100 is $150, coincidently the same
price.

I am questioning the determination of this price ($50) and its
application in the market mitigation plan.

In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan
specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic
withholding. How does the $50 price reference a specific unit, I am not
sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire
statewide price and then compare it to a generator's bid.

If a generator's fuel costs (without fixed cost recovery) is $150 that
unit would presumably never bid below its cost, it would always bid as a

in the market mitigation plan. A 300% increase would be $450 and an
increase of $100 would be $250, and yet using the AMP interpretation of
the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding
is $150.
It would seem that the AMP methodology is improperly applying the Market
Mitigation Plan. The Mitigation Plan is supposed to identify generator
conduct and clearly in the application of the AMP it is not.

The simple question would be is the $150 threshold representative of
every generator's bid to determine economic withholding. The answer can
only be no, how can it be?

The Market Mitigation Plan was intended to determine whether a generator
was exercising market power. The determination of whether a generator
was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all
of the prevalent market, unit and system conditions to determine if that
unit was in fact exercising market power. The more complex the system
the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised.

How does a price trigger (or any automatic threshold) take all of the
complexities of a situation into account? It cannot, I suspect that is
why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power
determination. The full facts are presented and evaluated, every case is
unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact.
In other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the
NYISO AMP it is offered as a solution.


I do agree that prices should not be posted in the DAM if they are high
as a result of market power. A better solution would be to delay the
prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made. In
the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they
should be held in reserve for determination of market power. Prices can
be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power,
at least then due process can be followed. Market participants can be
consulted in accordance with the Plan and if required SCUC can be rerun.

External proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are
consistent with the orginal DAM posting if a longer period of time is
required for market power evaluation. The AMP is still in place but is
only used to identify potential market power until a ""human"" evaluation
is done.

The NYISO has chosen $150 as representative of a level to trigger market
mitigation. I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price
that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of $50.
A 300% increase or an increase of $100 is $150, coincidently the same
price.

I am questioning the determination of this price ($50) and its
application in the market mitigation plan.

In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan
specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic
withholding. How does the $50 price reference a specific unit, I am not
sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire
statewide price and then compare it to a generator's bid.

If a generator's fuel costs (without fixed cost recovery) is $150 that
unit would presumably never bid below its cost, it would always bid as a
minimum $150. How could that generator exceed the thresholds identified

Mark

Thanks for the clarification, regardless of what triggers mitigation it
is still an automated process that bypasses due process. System, unit
and market conditions are dynamic and therefore the circumstances to
determine market power are dynamic, you would assume that they are
fixed. Reference prices are dynamic based on many of the complexities of
the system. As a simple example I would offer gas basis as a complexity
that is not even taken into consideration.
Gas basis can have the result of increasing costs to a generator by as
an example $20/MMbtu, who at the NYISO is monitoring this on an hourly
basis?

If the most expensive unit on the system is given a reference price of
$150 what would be the highest clearing price you would expect to see
that would be set by an internal generator?

Since the NYISO reference bids for generators involved approximately
zero discussion with generators would you consider that following the
Market Mitigation Plan?

The default reference price for a generator's energy is based on
recently accepted bids for energy from that generator. In the event that
such data are unavailable a default reference price is either(1) by
negotiation with the generator, or (2) by an estimate of cost.

What defines an accepted bid? Is it the dispatch of a generator with
payment being either its bid or the LBMP price at the bus whichever is
higher. This is not clear to me.
What happened to the negotiation part?

In training material provided by the NYISO they clarify that a generator
must include all of its costs in its bid to ensure cost recovery, part
of those costs are fixed cost recovery. None of the default reference
bids assigned by the NYISO include any these costs.


Thanks

Joe

We completed the decontamination on both of the filter separators on the 
discharge of the Solexol Plant.  There was a thin film of an oily substance 
(presumably Solexol) on the interior wall of the filter separators.  However, 
both sets of filters were very clean.  No moisture was present on the filters 
and there was not any sludge or build up on any of the filters.  The filters 
that were removed had the same appearance of a brand new filter.  As a matter 
or fact, when you laid a new filter beside a used filter you could not tell a 
difference.  The filters being used are a Sock type filter and when you ran 
your hand across the filters you could not detect the presence of any 
moisture at all.

So, it's presumed that the system has been completely absent of any liquid.  
The small amounts of liquid being collected from week to week for sampling 
must have been accumulated from the run down or film, pre-existing on the 
interior of the filter separator housing.  A decontamination and triple rinse 
of each filter separator should result in a total absence of any liquid for 
future samples, other than the remaining soap and water used for the final 
rinse that could not be drained from the vessels.

Rich and I visited the Topock compressor station this morning and reviewed 
the sampling point on PG&E's inlet scrubber.  Rich made the recommendation to 
Randy Williams and Rick Bezanson (PG&E) that future samples be taken straight 
off the bottom of the scrubber rather than from PG&E's 1000 gallon blow down 
tank.  The purpose of this was to reduce the exposure to contaminating future 
samples with pre-existing PCB's that may have collected in the 1000 gallon 
blow down tank over a period of time.  PG&E agreed to sample from this point 
on future collections.

Both of the discharge lines on each filter separator at the Solexol plant 
have been hot tapped in preparation of Solexol injection.  Piping has been 
installed and pumps are in place to accommodate the Solexol injection as 
well.  However, NO injection of Solexol will take place until after our 
meeting next Tuesday with PG&E.

Transwestern has agreed with PG&E today to postpone our planned 
decontamination of the filter separator at Transwesterns PG&E meter station 
until April 28th, at which time Transwestern and PG&E will perform a 
decontamination of both TW's and PG&E's filter separators simultaneously.

We completed decontamination of the inlet filter at the selexol plant today. 
It was dirty but 
no liquid. There was some dried sludge in the bottom of the vessel and the 
filters were 
extremely dirty. We plan to do both of the filters on the discharge side 
tomorrow.I got a phone 
messsage from Jeff and he hasn't heard anything from PGE since the letter was 
sent . We will 
plan to bypass and clean the filter on the west side of the river, last one 
on our system Saturday
unless we hear something different tomorrow. We will notify the PGE operators 
of their plant 
tomorrow of our plans.If anyone needs to contact me my pager number is 
1-800-921-9564 and office
phone number is 505-260-4003. Leave a message on the office phone and it will

tap valves on location 
tomorrow for the selexol injection. We plan to install the valves as soon as 
they arrive.

Thanks RJ

By the way Bisti came on line today and they plan to run it tonight and be

Add to this dilemma the fact that the import and export limits posted on the

""Pavo, Mike"" <mike.pavo@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE
Discussion List:

It appears that the scheduling limits between ISONE and NYISO need to be
clarified and/or corrdinated.  I offer the following evidence:

> ISONE transfer limit to NY    = 600mw
> NYISO ATC/TTC posting (import from ISONE)  = 950mw
> NYISO DAM Net Import (from ISONE)   = 800 to 1050mw


1. how can NY resolve in the DAM more imports from ISONE than their own
TTC or more than ISONE's transfer limitation?
> I understand that there is no restriction on a Participant selling DA
and taking the risk of being able to deliver, but surely the software
should recognize the TTC limit and cut/prorate schedules based on price,
down to the TTC limit.  And I would presume that the two ISO's would
agree daily on the TTC limits between their respective pools, thus
ensuring that the DA transfers are always equal to or less than TTC..

2. how can we get the ISO's to coordinate something as simple as
transfer limits?
> At one time in my past life, the limiting control area's limit was the
TTC value used for both CA's....this must be on the SEAMS agenda...

Inquirying minds want to know....

Subject: Compliance with the Large Quantity Generator Requirements, 
Transwestern Pipeline Company

A review was completed of the storage tank requirements for  large quantity 
generators of hazardous waste.  These regulations apply to almost each 
mainline C/S in New Mexico,  Arizona and California (initiating at Station 9, 
Roswell to Needles and including the tanks on the Topock Lateral).  There are 
eighteen condensate tanks on the Transwestern mainline system which could 
potentially be impacted, however, only about 10 tanks have received hazardous 
waste liquids in the last 3-4 years.   The constituents which make these 
tanks fall under Subtitle C of RCRA  is the arsenic, lead and low flashpoint 
(VOC's) of the condensate.   PCB's are another issue and are subject to other 
requirements. 

Briefly, the liquids which collect into the tanks is highly variable in 
quantity, contaminant concentration and with respect to when condensate 
enters the tanks.  When the gas is extremely dry, no condensate is 
collected.  During periods of wet gas movement, condensate with arsenic, lead 
and low flashpoint is collected.  In the 1980's to mid 90's, all eighteen 
tanks collected sufficient condensate with arsenic, lead, flashpoint and 
PCB's that the contensate in the tanks was hauled away every 90 days.   From 
1995 up to 1999, the system was essentially dry and no liquids were 
collected.  The tanks did not fall under the hazardous waste requirements.  
However, this year, we are seeing more liquids hauled away as hazardous waste 
than we have seen in the past 4-5 years. 

I would like to discuss the issue of compliance with these tanks.  The 
consistency and volume of regulated  liquids which are now being collected at 
the C/S tanks warrants a discussion.   The El Paso incident may be a driving 
force in this issue.....

Subject:  Cancellation of May 1, 2001 BS&P call on credit policy

We previously agreed to hold a conference call meeting May 1 in
anticipation of having sufficient progress from the Credit Policy Working
Group (CPWG) to review.  After speaking with Andy Ragogna this afternoon, I
do not believe the CPWG is close enough to a detailed proposal to have a
productive conference, after all.  Consequently, I am canceling the May 1 
call.

Additionally, it appears unlikely at this point we will have a proposal
ready for the May 10 Management Committee  meeting. My report will simply
be a progress report on the Credit Policy issue, and a report on our plans
to develop this year's budget and goals recommendations.

Subject: Transmission Rates

Hey guys,

I've updated the transmission rates table for May - here is the location:

M:\Electric\East Volume Mgmt\Transmission\Transmission Rates

If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me 
know and I can put a copy of it whereever.

Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...

First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the 
counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric 
Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has 
not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49

Please pass this along to the rest of the group, if any of you have any 
questions or suggestions - don't hesitate to call.

Thanks,
Michael

Can someone shed any light on how much generation was on May 1 out of
merit?  I thought all such requests, whether by the Transmission
Provider or the ISO, were to be posted on the Dispatcher Notices.  There
were no notices posted between 04:03:58 and 21:50:53.  In that time
period I had gas turbines requested on by the ISO out of merit for 7
hours.  Was this done on a larger scale or was this an isolated
incident?",Non Abusive

environmental assessment you need for the above project and he said that he 
has received the packet you sent him but he needs to have additional 
clearification on some items which are pertinant for completing the EA.  Mr. 
Metzner was concerned that he would not be able to complete the EA by the 
specified time unless he discussed these issues with you.  METRIC has 
extensive experience with environmental assessments, but is not familiar with 
pipeline terminology and pipeline actions proposed uder the agreement with 
the Office of Pipeline Safety.

When you get a chance, would you please contact Pete at (505) 828-2801.

EMERALD: MAY BIRTHSTONE
==============================
Emerald is a green variety of the mineral beryl.  One of the
rarest members of the beryl family-only the red variety
(sometimes called ""red emerald"") is rarer-it is one of the most
highly prized of all the gems.  Aside from being the birthstone
for May, it was historically believed to bestow on its wearer
faithfulness and unchanging love, and was thought to enable
the wearer to forecast events.

The highest-quality emerald has the color of fresh young green
grass-an almost pure spectral green, possibly with a very faint
tint of blue, as in the finest emerald from Columbia, which is
considered by connoisseurs to be the world's finest.  Other
sources include Brazil, Zambia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia
and India.  Flawless emeralds are rare, so their ""flaws"" have
come to serve almost as ""fingerprints,"" while flawless
emeralds are immediately suspect.  Although a hard stone,
emerald will chip easily since it tends to be somewhat brittle,
so special care should be given in wearing and handling.

Techniques to enhance color and reduce the visibility of flaws
are also frequently used.  A common practice is to fill
surface-reaching cracks with oil (sometimes tinted green), a
practice that goes back to early Greek times.  Today's
emeralds are oiled using a vacuum/heat technology.  This is a
widely accepted trade practice, since it is actually good for
the stone in light of its fragile nature.  Oiling hides some
of the whitish flaws, which are actually cracks, filling the
cracks so they become less visible.  The oil becomes an
integral part of the emerald unless it is subjected to some
type of degreasing procedure.  The development and use of
the ultrasonic cleaner has brought to light the extensive-
ness of this practice.  Never clean emeralds in an
ultrasonic cleaner.

While oiling is considered an acceptable practice, be sure
the price reflects the actual quality of the stone.  If
necessary, most emeralds can be ""re-oiled.""


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
=========================

Name:   Uncle Sam
Weight: 40.23 carats (rough) and 12.42 carats (cut)
Color:  M (very light brown)
Clarity:VVS1
Shape: Emerald Cut

The Uncle Sam diamond, which was discovered in the ""Crater
of diamonds"" in Arkansas in 1924, is the largest yet found
in the United States.  Peiken Jewelers of New York City,
owned the Uncle Sam for many years.  For a while, it was
on loan to the American Museum of Natural History.  In
1971, Sidney de Young, a dealer from Boston, bought the
diamond and then sold it to an unnamed collector.


SEA DIAMONDS
===========================================
An enterprising Texan called Sammy Collins drew worldwide
attention in 1962 when he announced that he'd recovered
50,000 carats of diamonds worth $1.5 million from the
seabed off the treacherous Diamond Coast of South West
Africa.  Collins figured that since diamonds had been
found in abundant amounts along the coast, most likely
carried there by the Vaal and Orange rivers from some
far inland deposit, they also ought to be found under
the ocean.

Over a period of three years, Collins used the equivalent
of huge vacuum sweepers to suck some 400,000 carats of
diamonds from the seabed.  His adventures set off a
mini-rush by others to try this new type of exploration
but terrible working conditions and uncertain diamond
deposits sent most into early obscurity.

Today, with improved technology, De Beers and others are
once again probing the waters of the South Atlantic,
bringing closer the prospect of viable undersea
diamond recovery.


LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL?
============================================
We will be attending the annual JCK Jewelry Show in Las Vegas
the first week of June.  This is your opportunity to get access
to wonderful designer jewelry at a fraction of regular retail
prices.  With almost 3,000 booths of diamonds and jewelry from
all over the world, this trade show brings the most beautiful
jewelry in the world to one place.

If you have special piece of jewelry you've always wanted but
didn't think you could afford, give us a call so we can find
it for you.  The same goes for color gem stones since we can
hand pick from the most beautiful colored stones in the world
for your special ring, pendant or bracelet.

While the Diamond Source of Virginia does not have an inventory
of diamonds or jewelry, we have accounts with the leading
wholesalers and designers across the country and can special
order your custom jewelry or pick it out in person at this show.
We go with our shopping list for our customers and return with
the best of the best.  If you have a special request, please
give Anne a call at 888-477-8385 and tell us what you want.


SI2 CLARITY
=========================
While we recommend at least SI1 clarity for most
diamonds to ensure they are ""eye clean,"" many consumers
think that SI2 means nothing visible with the naked eye.
The following comments define the official GIA position:

""SI stones contain noticeable inclusions which are easy
(SI1) or very easy (SI2) for a trained grader to see
under 10X. Typical inclusions are included crystals,
clouds, and feathers, normally centrally located and
noticed immediately. A stone with an eye visible
inclusion can still be graded SI. You must consider the
size, nature, position, number, and color or relief of
the inclusion. The size and shape of the stone are
important too. Characteristics in the SI1 grade usually
are not visible to the unaided eye face-up.
Characteristics in some SI2 stones can be seen with the
unaided eye.""

We find that over half of the SI2 stones have visible
inclusions to the naked eye. Note the above comments
say ""visible to the unaided eye face-up."" With most
shapes of diamonds, inclusions are often easily visible
from the side where there are few, if any, facets to
hide them. We just sent a VS1 clarity princess back to
the wholesaler because the inclusion, while not visible
face-up, was easily visible with the naked eye from the
side. You can imagine what the SI2 diamonds look like
from the side if they are visible face-up. If the
mounting hides the side of the diamond, these side
visible inclusions are not a problem. But most mountings
show off the side of a diamond and make them easy to see.

INSURANCE QUESTIONS
==============================
Most people do not realize that insurers differ widely in
what they offer regarding coverage and reimbursement or
replacement.  Many insurance companies will not reimburse
the ""full value"" provided in the policy but, rather,
exercise a ""replacement"" option--and will offer a sum in
cash less than the amount for which the jewelry is
insured, or offer to replace it for you.  Therefore it is
important to ask some very specific questions to determine
the precise coverage offered.  We recommend asking the
insurer at least the following:

1) How do you satisfy claims?  Do you reimburse the insured
amount in cash?  If not, how is the amount of the cash
settlement determined?  Or do you replace the jewelry?

2) What involvements do I have in the replacement of an
item?  What assurance do I have that the replacement will be
of comparable quality and value?

3) What is your coverage on articles that cannot be
replaced?

4) Exactly what risks does my policy cover--all risks?
Mysterious disappearance?  Am I covered in all geographic
areas?  At all times?

5) Are their any exemptions or exclusions?  What if the loss
involves negligence?  What happens if the diamond falls out?

6) What are the deductibles, if any?

7) What documentation do you expect me to provide?

Every week we hear yet another story of a customer who paid
insurance premiums for years and were shocked to discover
how little protection they really had when they did have a
claim.  Check the small print before you need it.


FOUR C'S
===========================
Diamond quality and value are determined by four factors.
These factors are called the ""Four C's.""  If we were to rank
them based on their importance in determining the value of a
diamond, we would list them as follows:

1) Color
2) Clarity
3) Cut and proportion
4) Carat weight

In terms of determining beauty, however, we would rank them
in a different order:

1) Cut and proportion
2) Color
3) Clarity
4) Carat weight

When diamond shopping, it pays to put your focus on cut and
proportion since this is where you get the most impact on
beauty while paying little premium in price.  We recommend
investing your dollars in beauty you see rather than rarity
and higher ""quality"" not visible to your eye.

BOW TIE
=======
One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning
in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie, or butterfly effect,
a darkened area across the center or widest part of the
stone, depending upon the cut.  The bow tie is commonly
seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any
fancy shape.  Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will
exhibit some minimal bow tie effect.  Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper
proportioning.  In poorly proportioned stones there is a
pronounced bow tie; the more pronounced, the poorer the
proportioning.  The less pronounced the bow tie, the better
the proportioning.  The degree to which the bow tie is
evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make (cut).


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:

DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS

fine jewelry is to read one or more of the great books

What if a product called External Transmission Reservation Rights (ETRR) was

,on
the PJM/NY interface 100 mws of ETRR's  for exports were sold in two blocks of

9900 thus insuring the assigned bid blocks first acceptance of their bids. 
Thus
the winners of the ETRR's (having already paid the ISO for the space) have the

simplistic form that will allow the purchasing of long term transmission in a
financial transmission market. What do you think???

I might offer another simplistic solution that makes a whole lot more

Why doesn't the NYISO just separate their energy and transmission

As you are aware, David Roensch, Larry Campbell and I just traveled to Penn 
State University and had a lengthy meeting with Dr. Adawaumi.  This meeting 
was mainly related to obtaining an update on exactly where they were in 
progressing with the PCB Behavioral and Hydrodynamic Model for TW's Pipeline 
System.  For your reference I have attached to this note what I consider to 
be the key points from that meeting.   I hope you will take a few moments and 
review the attachment.  I will be glad to discuss any questions you might 
have.  

Based on what we learned during the meeting with Dr. Adawaumi, I am 
recommending that we have a meeting in the near future to discuss what the 
appropriate next steps should be related to whether or not we enter into 
Phase II (which would include cleaning an actual segment of TW's system) of 
this process.  My Secretary will be contacting you in the next few days to 
establish a time when you would be available for such a meeting (4 hours is 
needed).  For this meeting, Dr. Adawaumi will be asked to come down from PSU 
to make about a one hour presentation related to his findings and 
recommendations at this point.

I believe you will find this very informative and essential in establishing 
what our next steps will be.  

Thanks, John Shafer

the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside excelr Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these

President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don

success (and no emulsion problems). I have ordered three replacement pumps 
and skimmers (CEE GNE-24) to replace the three Marshalk pumps. I will have 
Clayton shut-down the recovery system until we can install the replacement 
pumps. This should take about 3-4 weeks.",Non Abusive

Dear Larry,

Everyone has their own definition of paradise. For some it's 
unspoiled beaches and lush tropical jungle. For others it's a more 
developed resort. For others, it's not about the outdoors at all--if 
you're one of those people who thinks a place called ""Sin City"" 
sounds just about perfect, we can help you, too. However you like it, 
Travelocity can help make it happen. Whether you're traveling with 
your sweetie, or just into the romance of traveling, Travelocity can 
help you plan and book the perfect trip. And that sounds like 
paradise to us.

Earn 20,000 AAdvantage Bonus Miles When You Travel to Hawaii!
The island of Oahu just might be the perfect place for a romantic 
getaway. That's because if you and your other half can't agree on a 
vacation here, we're not sure you're ever going to agree on anything. 
She likes seclusion, and you like bustle? No problem. Lively Waikiki 
is complemented by dozens of other beaches on the island, some of 
which you'll have practically to yourselves. Or maybe he's a city 
person, and you crave nature? It's easy to please both on an island 
that boasts both crowded Honolulu and rugged 3,000-foot mountains--all 
within an area you can drive clear around in a matter of hours. 

Grupo Taca is Currently Offering Sale Fares to Costa Rica!
Costa Rica, with its unspoiled beaches and abundant wildlife, is 
pretty close to paradise on earth. It's not highly developed--don't 
expect five-star accommodations, at least not in every village. Do 
expect uncrowded, even empty stretches of sand, protected rainforest, 
and the best birdwatching of your life. If getting away from it all 
is your idea of the perfect vacation, Costa Rica is the place 
for you.

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Generators are supposed to be dispatched in the DAM in accordance with
their generator commitment parameters, many of these parameters are not
respected.
The minimum runtime is the one that is garnering the most attention, but
there is another parameter that would appear to be modeled incorrectly
which can have a significant impact on both the penalties applied to
generators and also on the issue of system security as it is applied to
system reserves.

Generators are loaded in the DAM in accordance with their loading rates,
the minimum loading rate for generators is 1% of their maximum rating. A
500 MW unit will have a loading rate of 5 MW/minute.

As an example of how SCUC loads generators I will use actual dispatch
data from Arthur Kill 2.

Arthur Kill 2 has a maximum rating of 359 MW and therefore has a loading
rate of 3.6 MW/minute.
The unit minimum is 90 MW and when dispatched from one hour to the next
should be constrained to what the unit can actually load.

We have received dispatches on our unit that would have the unit loaded
to 90 MW on average for one hour and then loaded to 241 MW for the next
hour. If the unit started loading at the end of the hour and loaded at
its loading rate of 3.6 MW/minute the unit would have loaded to 306 MW
by the end of the next hour. the unit would have loaded 3.6 MW/minute *
60 minutes or 216 MW. The increase of 216 MW represents an average of
108 MWhrs for the hour. Add the 90 MW from where the unit started from
its previous hourly dispatch and you will have an average for the next
hour of 198 MWhrs, this represents the maximum hourly average this unit
can perform and yet SCUC has the unit loaded to an average of 241 MWhrs.
This is impossible for the unit to load to and should represent a
deficiency for this hour in the DAM.

To further increase this problem SCUC has accepted the reserve bids from
this unit for both 10 minute spin and 30 minute spin for the hour that
the unit was already loading at its maximum loading rate. Since the unit
is already loading at its maximum rate, the unit should not be
considered for reserve since it cannot participate.

This problem is not isolated to this particular unit and is replicated
on our other units also.
If generators cannot follow their DAM schedules they must buy this
energy from the R/T even though it is impossible for them to match their
physical capabilities against their financial obligations as they are
dispatched to in the DAM. Add this to the fact the unit(s) are unable to
provide reserve to the system when they are already loading at their
maximum rate represents a system security problem.

I would suggest that SCUC only load generation at what the generation
can actually load to and be restricted to a maximum change hour over
hour of 30 minutes times their loading rate and if the unit is already
loading at its maximum rate then it should not be able to participate in
the reserve market.

I may be missing something but then again maybe not, hence the note to
the TIE list if other generators are affected in a similar fashion.

In addition to adjustments to billing units due to the receipt of billing
quality
metering data, this settlement adjustment includes the following billing code
modifications/corrections:

   Billing code was modified to model scheduling & dispatch of grouped
   generators
   for settlement of energy & bid production cost guarantee payments.
   Generators
   affected by this modification should see proper payment of those 
quantities.
   Any
   costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers
   through
   their OATT Schedule 1 residual & BPCG adjustments
   For the December settlement adjustment, billing code was modified to ensure
   that
   appropriate prices corrections resulting from ECA-B were captured in the
   billing.
   This may impact transmission customers whose transactions were subject to
   ECA-B
   treatment, resulting in transmission usage charge adjustments.  Any costs
   incurred
   by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers through their 
OATT
   Schedule 1 residual adjustment.
   For the December settlement adjustment, a number of grandfathered rights &
   TCC
   configurations were corrected.  Customers affected by this would see either
   their
   TCC's converted back to grandfathered rights, or vice versa.  Any excess or
   deficiency
   in cost recovery will be balanced with the Transmission Owners, based upon
   their
   respective megawatt-mile coefficients.
   There was a code modification to allow for Class 2 PURPA generators to sell
   all
   over-generation to the real-time market.  This would result in payment to
   those
   affected suppliers.    Any costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered 
from
   transmission customers through their OATT Schedule 1 residual adjustment.

The total dollar amount for 1999 Expense in the ET&S Albuquerque Region is 
$345,000 (excluding Gomez, Bell Lake, & N. Crawar remediation projects which 
are accounted for separately due to sale agreements). This amount is not 
allocated for specific projects but includes all environmental O&M costs for 
the region. As it is, this amount may not be sufficient to cover costs for 
the ongoing Expense projects, including: Thoreau Lease Payment, Roswell 
Remediation, WT-1 Dehy Area Remediation, WT-1 Pit Area Remediation, Eunice 
Monitoring, & Puckett Monitoring. The Albuquerque Region 1999 Capital budget 
for remediation projects is about $270,000; this includes: Thoreau 
Remediation, Laguna Groundwater Remediation, Lockridge Remediation, and 
Atoka-1 Remediation. If the capital projects are rolled into O&M, the O&M 
budget will be far too insufficient. A related issue is concerning the 
allocated AFUDC costs. These costs will add about $60,000 to the Thoreau 
Remediation project cost and about $10,000 to each of the Laguna and Atoka-1 
Remediation projects. These costs were not budgeted for because I was under 
the assumption that new work orders would be issued for 1999, in which case, 
AFUDC costs would only be allocated based on 1999 spending charged to the new 
work orders. New work orders were not issued and the 1999 budgeted amount for 
the Thoreau Remediation of $78,000 can not possibly absorb the anticipated 
AFUDC costs. 

I will keep you posted of any further developments. Thanks, George

Subject: AFUDC on Remediation Projects

George,
This whole deal is still up in the air.  When I brought up the subject of 
AFUDC to Property Accounting, they started questioning whether these 
particular projects qualify to be ""CAPITAL"" at all.  I discussed the matter 
with Dan Pribble and he says to leave them as capital as long as I can but 
Property Accounting is going to want some real substantial justification 
before long for continuing to carry them in their arena.

And, if we end up having to dump a substantial portion of the total costs in 
all 5 of the current workorders to O&M, that will really kill the O&M budgets 
of the affected Teams.

So, don't do anything different from what you have been doing until we tell 
you different.

Thanks.

> million ($2.62/share) on revenues of $6.7 billion, compared to year-ago
net
