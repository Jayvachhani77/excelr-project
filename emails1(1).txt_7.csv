Subject: Practice - TONIGHT


Practice is absolutely necessary to assure our victory.    So we will have 
several practices this week  (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday... with no 
drinking and a curfew on Friday) and may cancel the scrimmage to schedule in 
more practices.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.


IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball 
and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.   
Eric please bring a couple of footballs.



If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc.



----

Also, Sarah, please bring Gerald to the game.  He helped greatly last year, 
and a stand by would be excellent in the event of injury.

HELLO AGAIN E-RIDERS!


Yes, the snow has started to come down! In very big ways!  In fact, Telluri=
de=20
has received over 3 feet of fresh powder since October 1 and the temperatur=
es=20
have been frigid=01(which makes for excellent snowmaking conditions. Winter=
 has=20
come, and you know what that means =01( YES! Time to strap on some boards a=
nd=20
make some turns!


SNOW REPORT
As the snow has begun to come with increasing regularity, you can imagine t=
he=20
local attitude begins to buoy. At lunch the other day, when we looked out t=
he=20
window and saw the big flakes coming down, we made a loud whoop with our=20
waiter, causing all heads in the restaurant to turn our way. But when the=
=20
other diners saw the white stuff, EVERYONE started buzzing with the=20
anticipation. Folks are getting ready for the season. For a sneak preview,=
=20
check out the photo of the day at www.telluride-ski.com/dayphoto.html.


BARGAINS & DEALS
The best-case scenario for skiing Telluride is to live here. But the NEXT=

best-case scenario is that you get a screaming deal to vacation here. And=
=20
that=01,s what Telluride and Mountain Village Visitor Services has for you.=
=20

If you choose to put together a package on your own, check out the lodging=

WHAT=01,S NEW
You can never have too much snow. With that in mind, the Telluride Ski Reso=
rt=20
installed a new snowmaking system this summer that guarantees that every li=
ft=20
pod will have coverage on at least one run all season long! Yep. Lifts 1, 4=
,=20
5, 6, 7 and 9 will have better conditions for riding and skiing from=20
beginning to end. As the hipper folks say, the turns will be =01&tasty.=018

The tastiest new addition to the mountain, however, is Allred=01,s, a new=
=20
140-seat restaurant that is guaranteed to delight even the most=20
discriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St.=20
Sophia, Allred=01,s will serve as a private club by day in the winter, an=
=20
upscale lunch spot in the summer and a fine dining experience in the evenin=
gs=20
year-round. More on this epicurean dream in later e-rides. For dinner=20
reservations, call 970-728-7474.

One other great new thing: It=01,s easier to get to Telluride than ever bef=
ore.=20
You can now fly to Montrose EVERY DAY from Dallas/Ft. Worth on American=20
Airlines=01*but the flight will only have 129 seats, so be sure your body i=
s in=20
one of them!


WHAT=01,S HAPPENING
Of course the most important thing on the Telluride calendar is November 22=
,=20
the Official Opening Day. But there are other things worth mentioning. Like=
=20
the Sneak Preview of the mountain on November 21. For one day only you can=
=20
ski Telluride for $20, and all proceeds go to the Telluride Ski and Snowboa=
rd=20
Club.

After the Donation Day, you can still get good deals. From November 21=20
through December 16, Telluride hosts its annual Ski Free & More program. Wh=
at=01,
s it entail? Exactly what it says. Skiers and riders staying at participati=
ng=20
lodges in the towns of Telluride and Mountain Village can choose a free lif=
t=20
ticket, a free ski clinic, a free lunch or a free half-day of childcare for=
=20
each night they stay. For more information call 888-288-7360.

And if you=01,re looking forward to having a ball, why not do it right at t=
he=20
annual Black & White Affair? On November 25, the Telluride Ski and Snowboar=
d=20
Club hosts this gala event at the luxurious Telluride Conference Center.=20
Dress up and dance off your turkey. No one puts on a ball like Telluride!


SLICE OF LIFE
Imagine being over 50 years old and never having seen any snow! Such was th=
e=20
case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the Caribbea=
n.=20
She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the snows began to=

fall a few weeks ago, they were in rapture! Sarah ran outside and began to=
=20
dance around (to her 17-year-old daughter=01,s absolute embarrassment!) How=
ever,=20
the daughters both caught the enthusiasm and built their first snowman ever=
.=20
The snowman , of course, had a perfect carrot nose.. An organic carrot, no=
=20
less. Hey, this is Telluride. Only the best for our snowmen.


AND SO, E-RIDERS,
That=01,s all for this letter. Hope you=01,re planning your trip to Telluri=

Hi all!

We went looking at puppies this weekend, supposedly
just ""to look,"" and of course end up bringing one
home!  She has already made the trip to the office and
one of my co-workers had his digital camera here to
take pictures for Halloween!

Hope to talk to each of you soon!

Love, Julia

I need your help.  When I get married in June we are going to leave out of Houston and fly to Cancun.  But, I need a nice hotel to stay in the night of the wedding in Houston.  I need suggestions, phone number, etc.  Also, I want a limo to take me from the reception in Conroe to the Hotel in Houston.  I need suggestions and phone numbers for that also if you do not mind.

Subject: Fantast Basketball DRAFT TODAY @ 10:30

Since the NBA season begins tonight, we need to have the fantasy basketball 
draft today @ 10:30 AM. Tell me if this is ok.  If you do not remember the 
rules, go to the link below and scroll down to the bottom of the page to the 
rules link.

The Academy will roll once again!

And by the way plove, it is last day for everyone.  You can take 1 minute out 
of every half hour today to make a pick.  Everyone else has agreed.  Besides 
it won't be as much fun without my whipping boy again.

Subject: UT & atm flag football

I've received the fund raising envelopes for the flag football tournament.   
I need everyone to pick these envelopes and begin collecting for UT.

I'm at 2918b or you can send me your location and I will  try to use the 
interoffice mail.

Alternatively, you can just solicit on your own without the envelope (which 
makes it more official).   Keep in mind that contributions will be matched by 
excelr and make checks payable to the University of Texas at Austin.  Last 
year we donated about $30 K to A&M Bonfire memorial scholarship efforts.  
Money collected this year will goto the general scholarship fund at UT.


Each team is expected to raise $2000  and we have less than 20 days left, so 
do your part.

---

Also, if anyone is interested in practicing this weekend or next, let me know 
and I will try to arrange it.  Webb's team is not practicing.


---

Finally, we're still short 2 guy players.

Subject: Chili Taster


Notes From An Inexperienced Chili Taster Named FRANK, who was
visiting Texas from the East Coast:

Recently I was honored to be selected as an outstanding Famous
celebrity in Texas, to be a judge at a chili cook-off, because no one
else
wanted to do it. Also the original person called in sick at the last
moment,
and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking
directions
to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two
judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and
besides
they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted.

Here are the scorecards from the event:

Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili

JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.
JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.
FRANK: Holy cow, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried
               paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers to
put the
               flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are
crazy.

Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili

JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.
JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken
                        seriously.
FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am
               supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two
people
               who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to
               walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on
my face.

Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.
JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.
FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I
               have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by
now.
               Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the

               front part of my chest. I'm getting drunk.

Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic

JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.
JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or
                        other mild foods, not much of a chili.
FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to
               taste it. Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me
with fresh refills;
               that 300 lb. witch is starting to look HOT, just like
this nuclear-waste
               I'm eating.

Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding
                       considerable kick. Very impressive.
JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit
                        the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.
FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted
               and four people behind me needed paramedics. The
contestant
               seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given
me brain
               damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring
beer directly
               on it from a pitcher. It really pisses me off that the
other judges asked
               me to stop screaming.  Rednecks!

Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice

                       and peppers.
JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic.
                        Superb.
FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous,
sulfuric
               flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except
big Sally.
               I need to sooth my butt with a snow cone!

Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.
JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of
chili
                        peppers at the last moment. I should note that I
am worried
                       about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit
of distress
                       as he is cursing uncontrollably.
FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't

                feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and
the world sounds
                like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered
with chili which
                slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of
lava-like stuff to
                match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll
know what
                killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too
painful. Screw it, I'm
                not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just
suck it in through
                the 4 inch hole in my stomach.

Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all,
not too bold
                       but spicy enough to declare its existence.
JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor
hot. Sorry
                        to see that most of it was lost when Judge
Number 3 passed out,
                        fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself.
Not sure if he's going
                        to make it. Poor Yank.

Mike,

When (if :-) ) you have a minute could you do me a favour and send me an excel dump of all the deal numbers of GTMA Physical forwards we are expecting to settle for march production (27th to 1 April), with their projected volumes, the contract price, and the value?  This will help me get an idea of whether we have any missing data.  

Thanks

James

Hey Commish,

It appears as though I did not receive points for the Miami Defense (18) or 
Lamar Smith (36) due possibly to the late ending of the Monday night game...  
With the points, I should have 132 and a victory over the Snake Pit... As it 
stands now, I have only 78 points, and a loss in the system... Is there

propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that excelr can support employee

Subject: Gorons

Don't know who you're voting for, but here some things you might want to 
consider-


What is a Goron

   1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:
a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last
year.

   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobacco
when  he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies.

   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in fact
he was  placed by family influence in a ""cushy""  correspondent's job and
the only  action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)

   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt Law  educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sums
of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to ""invent the
Internet"" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially  incriminating e-mail!

   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the models for the book and movie, ""Love Story"" even though the book's
author,  Erich Segal, says not.

   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.

   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton ""one of
the greatest Presidents of our history.""

   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
ineffective  that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH of
Tennessee's  Senators!

   11.  Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum  house that he was renting to them.

   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons are
generally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to
actually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from their
ailment, since it may be  harmful to their well-being, yours, mine and
that of the USA.

   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out to
aid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,  PLEASE, pass this on to
your normal  friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.

We are still in the determination phase as far as what we are willing to 
sell.  Obviously, we would like to sell as close to the 10 yr average as 
possible. However, given the recent warmth of the past few winters and the 
forecsts,  this is probably an unrealistic goal.  I will get back to you by 
the end of the week with an acceptable target.

Thanks,

Subject: hobby jan-mar structure

Eric,

I've put a Jan-Mar Hobby $10,000/$2 million swap offer in the market of 635 
HDDs.  635 is the 10 year average.  Given the forecasts for normal to warm in 
the Gulf area this winter - with particular emphasis on warmth in the Jan-Mar 
period - I anticipate that bids will come back, initially, around 560 - and 
that we might be able to sell a swap around 585.  As a frame of reference, 
last year (2000) came in at 412.5 HDDs and 1999 came in at 429.5 HDDs.

What kind of number are you looking for  - do you want to leave an order with 
me where you'd be willing to sell the swap?

If you're interested in buying an option, perhaps you'd like to put a bid out 
on the following structure:

Hobby
Jan-Mar
$15,000/HDD
$2,700,000 Limit
560 strike (1/2 standard deviation from the 10 year average)

I imagine you could get this option for approx. $750,000.  The same option 
with a $2,000,000 limit would go for about $100,000 less.

Let me know your thoughts.

Regards,
Gary

I am really getting worried.  I was sitting down to
send you a message to thank you for the gorgeous
flowers and to tell you that ""you are your father's
son"".  In the meantime, I received that hillarious

the very same card!!!  You two are amazing.

Thank you for the card and the flowers.  I love you,

Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to excelr; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped excelr create new=20
businesses like excelr Broadband Services and excelr Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as excelrOnline and excelrCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of excelr and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some excelr companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
excelr Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.excelr.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@excelr.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20
family.  We believe this program takes communication at excelr to a new leve=
l=20
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=
=20
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=
=20
excelr is a great place to work.

Hello All -

I just wanted to let everyone know that Moni is celebrating her 24th
birthday tomorrow night at Sherlock's.  Michael and I are going for sure,

going.   The rest of you better come too.  I know Moni hasn't seen any of
you in awhile, and she would appreciate all of you being there!

promotions to the starting lineup?=20
=09?? Marge Ringer=20
=09
=09BROWN: Major Applewhite was named the starter for the Colorado game on=
=20
Tuesday by coach Mack Brown. Brown said Chris Simms would only be used on a=
=20
""need-to-win"" basis, meaning that for the first time this season, there is =
no=20
plan to play both QBs this week. The coaches are hoping that by turning the=
=20
offense over to Applewhite exclusively, there will be a spark. UT offensive=
=20
coordinator Greg Davis said, however, that Texas could go back to the QB=20
rotation after this week. The coaches will wait and see. As far as other=20
promotions, B.J. Johnson will start at flanker ahead of Brandon Healy and R=
oy=20
Williams will start at split end ahead of Montrell Flowers. The coaches mad=
e=20
these promotions, in part, to help encourage Williams and Johnson to take=
=20
more of a vocal leadership role. And coaches said freshman tight end Brock=
=20
Edwards might see more playing time, and running back Kenny Hayter will see=
=20
more carries than the two he had against OU last week.=20

=09Kenny Hayter=20
=09
=09Q:I'm having trouble understanding why the Longhorns will not put in a b=
igger=20
running back during first and second down to increase their chances at a=20
third-and-short situation. I believe Hodges Mitchell is more of a third-dow=
n=20
back who is better suited for throwing to out of the backfield than he is a=
=20
guy who can pound the ball straight ahead and pick up four to six yards on=
=20
first and second down. Watching the game last week and previous games as=20
well, I've noticed too many times that Texas has put itself in third and=20
long  situations due to not
=09
=09picking up anything on the first two downs. Kenny Hayter, in my opinion,=
 is a=20
more physical back who doesn't go down as easy. They should put him in ther=
e=20
on first and second down to pick up some positive yardage, and bring in=20
Hodges to run draw plays and block on third down since he has good hands an=
d=20
is a reliable blocker. =20
=09?? Eric Barker, Plano, Texas=20
=09
=09BROWN: Texas got behind so early against Oklahoma that the running game=
=20
became a moot point. Mack Brown said he should have run the ball more in th=
e=20
second half to grind out the clock and keep the score closer. But he said h=
e=20
was foolish enough to think his team could come back, so UT tried to throw=
=20
and score quickly. Hayter took most of the first-team snaps in practice thi=
s=20
week, so look for him to get more of a chance against Colorado.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:What recruits were on the sideline for the OU game? =20
=09?? Lance Kyles=20
=09
=09BROWN: None. Texas was the visiting team. Only the home team is allowed =
to=20
bring recruits to UT-OU game. So UT will be allowed to bring recruits to ne=
xt=20
year's OU game.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Why did Kenny Hayter get only two carries? Why didn't our defense get=
=20
pressure on Josh Heupel? Why do we run so many 5-yard patterns on offense?=
=20
Give us the answers, Chip. What are the coaches' comments on these  topics?=
=20
=09?? Cody Anderson, Houston=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think I've pretty much answered the Hayter question. The runnin=
g=20
game became somewhat irrelevant in the OU game pretty quickly because UT wa=
s=20
forced to pass to try to get back in it. But Hodges Mitchell did get a lot =
of=20
time, mostly because he ran for 204 yards in last year's OU game and becaus=
e=20
he is the bigger receiving threat. Look for Hayter to get more carries this=
=20
week. It's hard to believe that Shaun Rogers makes that big of a difference=
,=20
but Casey Hampton said UT would have gotten more pressure on Heupel if Roge=
rs=20
was in there. Rogers is expected to play this week. The 5-yard patterns,=20
according to offensive coordinator Greg Davis, are the routes that the=20
defense is giving Texas. The coaches want the receivers to become more like=
=20
running backs after the catch and use their speed and moves to break for bi=
g=20
yards.=20

ed=20
at the time, but I was even more horrified to learn that  this was par for=
=20
the course for UT football coaches. Mack Brown seems to have been truly=20
embraced by the community over the last two years, but I'm  worried we are=
=20
about to see a repeat of history. What do you think?=20
=09?? Lisa Davis, Austin=20
=09
=09BROWN: I was surprised at the venom being spit this week in and around=
=20
Austin. People were talking about hiring John Mackovic as offensive=20
coordinator or bringing in Spike Dykes to talk to UT about how to respond=
=20
after being blown out. All of this is crazy. Now, I will grant you that thi=
s=20
game with Colorado is do-or-die as far as the Big 12 title. If UT loses it,=
=20
the Horns will pretty much need the rest of the Big 12 South to fall apart =
in=20
order to get into the league title game. But if UT wins, the Horns are real=
ly=20
in the driver's seat for the Big 12 South title. I say that because the=20
chances of OU winning two of three against No. 1 Nebraska, No. 2 Kansas Sta=
te=20
and at Texas A=02?are slim. The chances are good the Sooners will emerge wi=
th at=20
least two losses in those games. Texas can get right back in the race with =
a=20
win Saturday. If the Longhorns do win and UT looks good with Major Applewhi=
te=20
at QB, then everyone will say ""I told you so, Mack"" regarding the QB rotati=
on=20
having slowed down UT's offense all season. But the critical fans will also=
=20
embrace Mack and move on. If Texas loses, I think people will be upset, but=
=20
they will also need to get behind Mack Brown and start building support for=
=20
the rest of this season and next season. Mack Brown isn't going anywhere.=

idea =20
what I would do in their situation. Having said that, I now must say that =
=20
after a while, one begins to wonder about the coaching. You've said  numero=
us=20
times that the coaches shouldn't be blamed for the Longhorns'  inconsistenc=
y,=20
and most of the time I agree with you. However, this pattern  UT seems to=
=20
follow amazes me. Every few games, everything just blows up and  we are=20
embarrassed. How can a team with such obviously great talent manage  to scr=
ew=20
up horribly in random=20
=09
=09games? My only thought is that it has to be  the coaching. It's not like=
 the=20
players aren't good enough. Kenny Hayter  proves in the OSU game to be the=
=20
solution to the running game's problem.  Why replace him the next weekend i=
n=20
a much bigger game with the truly  hard-working, but honestly inefficient=
=20
Hodges Mitchell? Why run the ball  over and over when it obviously doesn't=
=20
work? Or it could work, if the  right players were in... These things baffl=
e=20
me. Do you think the coaching  is one of the problems? What can be done to=
=20
fix the inconsistencies that  are actually becoming consistent and developi=
ng=20
a pattern of embarrassing  losses? Last year there was N.C. State, and then=
=20
the last three awful  games. This year, it's  mediocre Stanford, and the go=
od=20
but not THAT good  OU. Will it ever stop? Thanks, I enjoy your newsletter.=
=20
=09?? David Rowe, Austin=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think the OU game was, to some degree, an aberration. Oklahoma =
got=20
it going and kept punching Texas in the face, and UT never got a punch in t=
o=20
slow the Sooners down. Josh Heupel looked like Joe Montana, and the avalanc=
he=20
was on. The biggest problem for Texas right now is no leadership on offense=
.=20
Giving the offensive reins to Major Applewhite this week is a great move, I=
=20
believe. It could give the Longhorns confidence, if it's not too late and t=
he=20
offensive psyche hasn't been beaten down too much. The offensive line has n=
o=20
vocal, emotional leaders. Antwan Kirk-Hughes is developing into that guy. B=
ut=20
none of the other guys are fiery, vocal guys. And Applewhite has been an=20
ineffective leader to this point because he has been so worried about wheth=
er=20
he is going to play well enough to stay in a game with this QB rotation.=20
Coaches can only do so much when it comes to leadership on the field. You=
=20
can't make a guy do more pushups and make him into a leader. That stuff is=
=20
inherent in players. Either you have it or you don't. On defense, Casey=20
Hampton and Shaun Rogers are the heart and soul. On special teams Beau Trah=
an=20
needs to take command. On offense, it's clearly Applewhite who will have to=
=20
step up. Maybe the end of the QB rotation will help him do that.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Is it obvious to just fans or everyone that the Texas coaches fail to =
have=20
the team prepared each week and fail to provide the opponent with a new =20
wrinkle or two each week? The opposing team always seems to know what is=20
coming while Texas is always caught by surprise early on. On offense, the=
=20
play-calling is extremely predictable and increasingly  uncreative. On=20
defense, the opponents used what worked in previous weeks against Texas and=
=20
the defense never seems to have made an adjustment. The defense uses the sa=
me=20
blitzes without mixing things up enough. Both coach Reese and coach Davis=
=20
seem extremely stubborn and refuse to try something new for fear of a mista=
ke=20
or setback. Well, we have suffered both, so why not give the players some=
=20
excitement and give the opposing team some uncomfortable feeling while on t=
he=20
sideline after seeing something totally new? It seemed to work against OSU=
=20
with a little different blocking scheme. Good job but do it every week,=20
especially against the tougher opponents. Do you see these problems and=20
tendencies also?=20
=09?? Todd Purl=20
=09
=09BROWN: In talking to Greg Davis on Tuesday, he said he is re-evaluating =
his=20
play calling and has questioned himself about the creativity of it. Texas h=
as=20
done well in the shotgun, four-wide, one-minute offense. But Davis said jus=
t=20
using that set goes against their philosophy of trying to be balanced 50-50=
=20
with the run and the pass. At some point, and maybe this week, if that line=
=20
can't open any holes for the backs, it will be time to give up hopes of bei=
ng=20
balanced and throw the ball out of four wides and use the pass to set up th=
e=20
run. We'll see if things improve this week. There is no question that the=
=20
coaches are rethinking EVERYTHING right now. Davis also said he has gotten=
=20
after the offense for all the penalties that have been killing early drives=
.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:I am a Longhorn fan who tries to be realistic. Win alot, lose some -- =
be=20
realistic. One thing that is very disturbing to me now, above winning and=
=20
losing, is the following: After the last four big games, some Longhorn has=
=20
said ""the other team just wanted it more"" After Oklahoma, it was Hodges=20
Mitchell who said it. I remember reading the same comments after Arkansas a=
nd=20
Nebraska. Why do you think our players are not as hungry as our opponents? =
Or=20
is it the players will not give it up for Mack Brown as the Sooners might =
=20
for Bob Stoops, the Hogs do for their coach, etc. =20
=09?? Mike Engelman=20
=09
=09BROWN: This is an interesting question and one that I think is very tell=
ing.=20
When Texas was the underdog or was still surging from the depths of 4-7 und=
er=20
the new attitude brought in by Mack Brown, the Longhorns got up for teams=
=20
like Nebraska (1998 and 1999) and Texas A=02?(1998) and won. But now that T=
exas=20
is the favorite in every game, the Longhorns are struggling. Even though=20
Brown built North Carolina into a national power by the end of his tenure=
=20
there, the Tar Heels were never expected to win a national title. But with=
=20
everything Brown has done to stir up interest and belief in Texas (recruiti=
ng=20
star players, beating Nebraska twice, re-establishing tradition), he will b=
e=20
expected to contend for a national title here in the very near future. So h=
e=20
has to find ways to get his team on edge for games such as OU, even when th=
e=20
Sooners have every reason to beat the Longhorns. The past five losses have=
=20
all come against teams who appeared to have more reasons to beat UT than UT=
=20
had to beat them - Texas A=02?(revenge and the bonfire tragedy), Nebraska (=
had=20
been beaten by UT three straight times), Arkansas (finally back in the Cott=
on=20
Bowl, looking to beat its old rival), Stanford (coming off 69-17 loss to UT=
=20
in 1999) and Oklahoma (loser of three straight to UT). If Texas has any hop=
e=20
of fending off teams looking to make a name for themselves with a win over=
=20
Texas, Brown will have to find ways to equalize the incentive factor and ma=
ke=20
his team more hungry. Again, some of that will have to come from leadership=
=20
among players. Some of it will be Mack Brown reinventing himself or=20
constantly arousing the senses of his players in different ways.=20

=09Greg Davis=20
=09
=09Q:It was quite obvious from watching the game Saturday that we were=20
thoroughly outplayed in all phases of the game. Even more disappointing is=
=20
the fact that we were thoroughly outcoached, too. I am convinced that are=
=20
offensive schemes will continue to be inconsistent, at best, against the=20
better defenses in the country. To support my argument, I reviewed the last=
=20
seven games (including this one) we have played against ""good"" defenses=20
(K-State, Nebraska twice, A&M, Arkansas, OSU, OU). The results are terrible=
.=20
We have averaged 216 passing yards per game (would rank
=09
=09 54th in the country in 2000) and 52 rushing yards per game (112th in th=
e=20
country in 2000). Our total offense of 268 yards per game would rank 99th i=
n=20
the country in 2000. Although this review could be construed as overly=20
conservative, it still makes my point that our offense is well below averag=
e=20
when facing better defenses. I feel like Greg Davis is getting too much=20
credit for our offensive output against bad defenses, resulting in a failur=
e=20
to see the inherent weaknesses in our scheme. I would like your comments on=
=20
this prevailing problem and I would also like to know where Kenny Hayter wa=
s=20
on Saturday!  Thanks,=20
=09?? Lane=20
=09
=09BROWN: I tend to think that Davis does need to mix things up a little bi=
t=20
more. Perhaps by having one QB running the offense, things will settle down=
,=20
and some more offensive flow will result. I think the answers may begin=20
there. Perhaps if Applewhite can get things moving without fear of being=20
yanked, the confidence will spread everywhere, including the booth where=20
plays are being called. Without question, when a team is struggling, the=20
tendency is to simplify. Well, UT can't afford to simplify its offense=20
anymore.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Why did the coaching staff remove, or go away from, the quick-strike, =
no-=20
huddle offense that was used in the first game? The team seemed to come =20
alive when they began using that offense, along with the appearance of Majo=
r =20
Applewhite. I believe if this offense would have been used against Stanford=
, =20
the team would have been unbeaten going into OU. The quick-strike offense =
=20
did not make another appearance until a dire situation in the OU game. Then=
 =20
when the Horns used it, they moved the ball down the field and scored. Why=
=20
not  use this more and keep the defense guessing? Unlike most coaches, I=20
believe  with this style of offense, the pass will set up the run, and we a=
ll=20
would  love to see a consistent running game.=20
=09?? Brian Gannon=20
=09
=09BROWN: I will quote Greg Davis when I asked him the same question: ""The=
=20
one-minute offense creates a tempo. It forces the game to go up-tempo becau=
se=20
it's a situation where everything is done at the line. The argument against=

=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20

=09BROWN: Courtnee Garcia fell way behind after pulling a hamstring in the=
=20
pre-season. He hasn't been able to capture sizable playing time as yet. And=
=20
he lost his punt return duties to Hodges Mitchell and has even fallen behin=
d=20
Nathan Vasher as a backup in that role. So Garcia needs to try to convince=

the coaches in practice that he deserves some playing time and then make th=

most of it. Otherwise, there may not be enough snaps at split end (Garcia's=

=09
=09Q:Since all of the big programs are operating under the same recruiting=

restraints, I don't think its unreasonable to expect more out of the recrui=

that Texas has. UT has had as good of a haul of recruits over the last 3-4=
=20
years as any program in the country. Using the logic that has been offered =
up=20
by some UT followers, we should be patient and wait until next year or the=
=20
next. At that point, we will be waiting for the inexperienced defensive=20
tackles to mature ... or some other aspect of the team. I don't know where=
=20
the actual difference between the dominant programs and UT is, but I would=
=20
guess that it has something to do with getting ""senior"" performance from=20
underclassmen. Whether that is a product of the recruiting or motivation, I=
=20
don't know. What do you think?=20
=09?? Kevin P. McCarthy=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think it's fair to expect a lot from this team next year with t=
he=20
schedule UT has. And once Texas shows that it can crack the top 10 without=
=20
losing before the end of October, and if Mack Brown can keep getting star=
=20
high school recruits, the Longhorns will be expected to be in the top 10 fr=
om=20
then on. So starting next year, I think it's fair to put Texas in the top 1=
0=20
and expect them to stay there all season. The UT Towers freshmen receiving=
=20
corps will have a year of experience. Leonard Davis will be gone from the=
=20
O-line, but Robbie Doane should be a suitable replacement, and UT will have=
=20
all its running backs back except for Hodges Mitchell. The defense will los=
e=20
two first-round NFL draft picks (Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers), but Marcu=

=09
=09Q:The addition of Roy Williams has helped Major Applewhite open up the=

most confident, proven leaders from the QB position in the nation. In my=20
opinion, not even his injury or the fact that Chris Simms got a lot of reps=
=20
in the spring warranted even a thought of him having to share time. You can=
=20
say what you want, and Brown would obviously talk around this, but we would=
=20
not have lost the Stanford game if Applewhite had started and played the=20
entire game. Both QBs, and the offense as a whole, have not played up to th=

Gentlemen,

The following are links that have a map and a bracket for the tournament. 
Our first game is at 8:30 AM on Sunday. We have already lost Darren for the whole tournament and Gosset for at least the first game. 
Everyone must be there on TIME. That means that you must be at the fields no later than 8 AM! We now only have 10 guys for the first game!!!!!!!

If you can't make it at 8 AM, tell me know so we can replace you!!!!! EVERYONE e-mail me and let me know that you will be there by 8 AM! Gosset will fire you if you screw the team!!!!

Eric -  
We cannot delete meter #3537 from this particular Product Description since 
Products using this product location have already been transacted on 
(including Transaction #33491).   

Therefore, we will need to either create a new location name (what would be 
the ""new"" location name?) or we can advise the customers via a ticker  
message that the Product description for ""HPL/AguaD"" has been revised.    
Unfortunately, we are working through some issues with the ticker message 
system, but we have been advised that it will be in place soon.  Are you able 
to postpone until the ticker system is operable?

Please advise.

,=20
here are some selected quotes I thought readers might find interesting.=20
=09
=09 On the season so far and how the team has changed from last year:=20
=09
=09 ""We're excited about the position we're in being 4-0, and we're a confi=
dent=20
team going down to Dallas. We are more mature. We understand more. We play=
=20
harder and are better conditioned and stronger than a year ago.""=20
=09
=09 On having four turnovers in last year's game with UT:=20
=09
=09 ""Turnovers were a major factor. We had two interceptions that hit us ri=
ght=20
in the chest and we drop. Both of those interceptions led to scores for=20
them.""=20
=09
=09 On UT's quarterback rotation:=20
=09
=09 ""I don't bother to speculate why they do something or not. They run the=
 same=20
offense with both (Major) Applewhite and (Chris) Simms. I'm sure we'll see =
a=20
good part of Applewhite. I know who our starting quarterback will be, and=
=20
he'll be in there the whole go unless something happens.""=20
=09
=09 On OU's running game:=20
=09
=09 ""I hope our running game is a factor in this game. We're quite a bit mo=
re=20
confident in our running game because we've emphasized it.""=20
=09

e,=20
38-28:=20
=09
=09 ""We set the tone early last year and didn't finish the tone. There's no=
=20

,=20

=09Longhorn Q & A=20
=09 Q: I heard rumors that the Royal-Memorial Stadium will one day be the =
=20
largest stadium in terms of seating capacity in the country, seating some =
=20
114,000 folks. What's the chance of this happening in the near term? =20
=09 ?? Waxer, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Well, former UT regent Tom Hicks (owner of the Dallas Stars and=
=20
Texas Rangers) wants it done and is willing to help pay for it, so there is=
 a=20
good chance some movement on this could happen in the next few years. UT=20
would start by expanding and closing in the north end of Royal-Memorial. Th=
en=20
the focus would turn to the south end.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Kalen Thornton =20
=09
=09Q: What happened to Adam Doiron?=20
=09?? Morris W. Collie, Houston=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Adam Doiron was initially projected by UT defensive coordinator=
 Carl=20
Reese to be the top defensive end of the freshman class. He thought Doiron=
=20
would be the best run stopper of the bunch, and since that's an area Texas=
=20
wants to improve, Reese figured Doiron might play early on. But DE Kalen=20
Thornton moved ahead of Doiron during the pre-season, and now Reese is=20
considering redshirting Doiron. Doiron recently started working at defensiv=
e=20
tackle, and if any more players go down at that position, Doiron could see=
=20
playing time. The coaches like him, but might want to build for the future =
by=20
holding him out this season.=20
=09
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I was very happy to see some positive things from our offense in the=
 =20
second half, especially the running of Kenny Hayter, but I have a  question=
=20
about the punt team.=20
=09
=09It's obvious that opposing teams'  philosophy is to not call ""fair catch=
."" I=20
first noticed this against  Nebraska last year. And I certainly think that=
=20
making an early tackle by  invading the ""halo"" and receiving a 5-yard penal=
ty=20
is much better than  sitting back and possibly allowing a big return.
=09
=09But if we're going to  get the penalty, why not lay our ears back and po=
p the=20
receiver in the  mouth whether he's caught the ball or not? A big hit would=
=20
make that  penalty a little easier to swallow, don't you think?=20
=09?? Cody Anderson, Houston, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  No question about it. First, you want to try to avoid getting t=
he=20
penalty. But if you are going to get the penalty, then get your money's wor=
th=20
and give that returner something to remember for next time.=20
=09
=09I hate this rule. Colorado coach Gary Barnett went so far as to say that=
=20
against a team with great returners, such as Kansas State, who has David=20
Allen, it's better to violate the halo rule and tackle these guys, take the=
=20
5-yard penalty and keep them from breaking one 60 or 70 yards for a score.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: It seems like I've been waiting forever for the offensive line to cl=
ick.=20
Did something come together finally or have I not been paying attention? (I=
=20
am out of state and am limited to TV and had to miss one game.)=20
=09?? Jerry Secrets=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  No, things did click in the second half of the Oklahoma State g=
ame.=20
The running game used a gap-blocking scheme that focuses more on blocking=
=20
angles than individual players. On running plays, the guard opposite the pl=
ay=20
side was pulling and creating some room for cutbacks. Mack Brown said the=
=20
team had used the gap scheme in the past and it just didn't work. But last=
=20
Saturday, it did.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Will Sean Rogers play on Saturday?=20
=09?? Rick Bush, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think it's doubtful. Rogers didn't practice Tuesday and was s=
till=20
seen with his walking boot on to protect his sprained ankle. But I'm sure h=
e=20
and the coaches will evaluate his status right up until game time. Those hi=
gh=20
ankle sprains can be a nightmare if they don't heal properly, however. No o=
ne=20
wants to rush him back and then lose him for the season because his return=
=20
was premature.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Josh Heupel =20
=09
=09Q: OU has a great passing attack. Do you feel that Texas' young secondar=
y can=20
answer the call? =20
=09 ?? Marty Wagner=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  This is the battle of the game, in my opinion: OU's receivers v=
s.=20
UT's secondary. If OU quarterback Josh Heupel goes unpressured, the UT=20
secondary might need therapy after this game. But Rod =20
=09
=09Babers and Quentin Jammer have made progress each game. If Lee Jackson i=
s=20
back, he'll play strong safety, and Greg Brown would move from SS back to=
=20
free safety. That means Dakarai Pearson goes back to the nickel back, which=
=20
in this game, is good news for UT. You need Pearson in the game as much as=
=20
possible. In my opinion, he breaks on the ball better than most of UT's=20
D-backs.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: How do you see the Texas-Oklahoma game shaping up? What will be the =
keys?=20
=09?? Sara Wilson=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think the offenses are equal, so it will come down to who pla=
ys=20
the best defense. I think Texas has the better defense, even without Shaun=
=20
Rogers. So I see Texas winning, 24-20. Turnovers will change the complexion=
=20
of the game, of course. But I think UT is catching OU at the right time aft=
er=20
picking up some much-needed confidence on offense against Oklahoma State.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Now that the quarterback experiment SHOULD be officially over at Tex=
as,=20
do you expect Major Applewhite to start and play the entire game against OU=
?=20
Also (looking ahead to next year because this year it is no longer an issue=
),=20
do you think Major Applewhite would be a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidat=
e=20
IF he were to start every game and take 90 percent of the snaps?=20
=09
=09My two cents ... I think the Texas coaches better start treating Major=
=20
Applewhite like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country, which =
he=20
obviously is, and start treating Chris Simms like the second-best quarterba=
ck=20
at the University of Texas, which he might be. (I say might because I haven=
't=20
seen Chance Mock play in a game. He might be better than Simms.)=20
=09 ?? Clint Mickey=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Major Applewhite will start against Oklahoma (based on repetiti=
ons=20
with the first team in practice this week) and I would be shocked if he=20
doesn't play most or all of this game. In fact, I think Major will play mos=
t=20
or all of the next two games.=20
=09
=09If UT beats OU, the Colorado game will be one of those nightmare games=
=20
because UT will be fighting a letdown and the Buffaloes will probably still=
=20
be winless (the Bufs play at A=02?this week).  So, these next two games are=
 all=20
about experience. But I think Simms will be back in action when UT takes on=
=20
Missouri on Oct. 21 because the coaches are sticking with the notion of=20
having two starting quarterbacks.=20
=09
=09I think Applewhite would be a Heisman Trophy candidate this season if he=
 had=20
been the lone starter. It's just impossible to think of yourself as the bes=
t=20
player in the nation, I would think, when your coaches don't think you're t=
he=20
best QB on your own team.=20
=09
=09As far as next year, you would have to think the coaches are going to=20
continue this rotation because they have not backed off of it much this=20
season. We'll see. Mock is still two years away unless Applewhite or Simms=
=20
gets injured.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Major Applewhite =20
=09
=09Q: It's become obvious to everyone outside MackWorld that Major Applewhi=
te=20
has established himself as the one and only starting quarterback at Texas. =
It=20
has become ridiculous to call both quarterbacks ""starters"" and insist on=20
token starts for Chris Simms.=20
=09
=09It seems to me it would be less demeaning to Simms to name Applewhite as=
 THE=20
starter and bring Simms in for quality playing time during the game instead=
=20
of allowing him two series, then yanking him in favor of the REAL starter w=
ho=20
then plays the rest of the game. The current charade hasn't fooled anyone. =
As=20
fine as Simms' =20
=09
=09talent appears to be, this is Major's team.  Any comments? =20
=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I talked to Major one-on-one on Monday, and he said he didn't=
=20
realize how much confidence he had lost this season until he got the infusi=
on=20
of confidence by leading Texas on five straight scoring drives of the secon=
d=20
half against Oklahoma State. If the coaches are insistent about this=20
rotation, it will be interesting to see if Applewhite can continue to=20
maintain or build on the confidence he seized in the OSU game. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is happening with special teams? I know they have had some rece=
nt=20
success after missed tackles and have improved, but what I cannot understan=
d=20
is why the opposing team can get so close to Kris Stockton and UT, with=20
superior recruiting and athletes, can not even get close. This has really=
=20
hurt us. How is our blocking so different? Why does this problem persist? =
=20
=09?? Chad Dieterichs=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It sure appears to me that the players on the line are giving w=
ay=20
too much ground after the snap. Almost every punt this season has been a=20
matter of, can Stockton get the punt off before the opposing team collapses=
=20
onto Stockton's pocket?=20
=09
=09Mack Brown gets very upset with questions about the punt team. He says t=
hat=20
they use the same formation that every NFL team uses and that special teams=
=20
are prone to breakdowns because there aren't enough scholarships to recruit=
=20
special teams players. And he says young players have to be used because=20
veterans get tired playing offense and defense.=20
=09
=09I asked Mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting t=
o=20
have a mental block, now that two punts have been blocked this season. He=
=20
said he didn't know. He said the latest punt block against Oklahoma State w=
as=20
the result of OSU players twisting and a UT player failing to pick up the=
=20
assignment. At least this time, the punt blocker didn't run untouched throu=
gh=20
the middle of the line.=20
=09?
=09
=09 Q: I think people get too caught up in what's happening right now to re=
alize=20
what this team will be in a year or two. All we've heard about is how=20
wonderful Mack's recruiting has been and how loaded we are, yet how the=20
O-line is less than impressive and how the QB situation is hurting us.=20
=09
=09Guess what? Most of these ""great"" players are only 18. Remember Ricky as=
 a=20
freshman? Didn't think so. Think about how solid we will be in two years wi=
th=20
current players and the new recruits coming in. So if we lose another game =
or=20
two this season and end up in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl, no=
=20
biggie.=20
=09
=09In a year or two, we'll be right in there. So here's my question. What w=
ill=20
it take for Texas to be consistently rated up there with the great college=
=20
programs? Right now, as a friend of mine would say, we have a good team and=
=20
we're building a good program. It seems that Texas is heading in that=20
direction, but we have a little way yet to go. What does Texas need to be a=
=20
true Top 10 team? Is it personnel-based or is it about chemistry? =20
=09?? Alex Kephart, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think it has to do with chemistry and experience at this poin=
t.=20
The talent is there. Mack Brown is recruiting winners. But each of the line=
s=20
has to have experience, and there have to be some ""Braveheart""-type leaders=
=20
on the team.=20
=09
=09Right now, the offensive line is still growing, even though it has two=
=20
seniors. The defensive line has great senior tackles, but the ends are raw.=
=20
So the defensive line probably won't be great again after this year for a=
=20
couple years, if you believe that you need senior lines to win a national=
=20
championship.=20
=09
=09But I agree with you. Texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse in=
stead=20
of just a good team in the next two to three years. Everyone will put the=
=20
Longhorns back up in the Top 5 next year because of their schedule. But Tex=
as=20
will be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three years.=20
=09
=09Right now, Texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty (me=20
included) of holding Texas to the same standard as Nebaraska and Florida=20
State. But that's probably not fair just yet. The stud players Brown is=20
recruiting need time to settle into the system and get some experience. In=
=20
the next couple years, Texas will justifiably be held to the same standard =
as=20
the perennial powers.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: : I have two questions for you Chip: A) Does The University still ha=
ve=20
the longest scoring streak in NCAA football? B) If I find myself looking at=
=20
NEXT year's schedule after a payback loss at Stanford, do I need profession=
al=20
help? (P.S. You may also want to remind your readers we should NEVER feel=
=20
guilty about running up the score against U of H.)=20
=09?? Arland Bishop=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Texas has scored in a Big 12-record 231 straight games, dating =
back=20
to a 16-0 loss at Baylor in 1980. That is the second-longest active streak =
in=20
the nation. BYU holds the longest scoring streak: 318 games.=20
=09
=09Next year's schedule is even more appetizing than this year's schedule. =
The=20
only non-conference road game is at Houston. The non-conference home games=
=20
are New Mexico State and North Carolina. And the Big 12 schedule has Colora=
do=20
in Austin. UT will have Oklahoma in Dallas (as usual) and Texas A=02?at Kyl=
e=20
Field.=20
=09
=09So, no, you don't need therapy. If anything, next year's schedule should=
 be=20
another reason to have patience with this year's team. Good times are=20
obviously on the horizon.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I know the subject has been worn into the ground, but I haven't hear=
d=20
this view from anyone so ... In the mid-'90s Florida State was struggling=
=20
early in the season with a young, talented QB named Charlie Ward (of course=
).=20
They were winning the early games against less-talented teams, but just=20
barely. Then, they finally put Ward in the shotgun on virtually every down=
=20
and let him do his magic.=20
=09
=09It was like night and day.  Basically, what they did was abandon their m=
ore=20
balanced attack and did what their talent dictated they could do - pass ear=
ly=20
and often. The run was still used, but it was more to complement the pass.=
=20
=09
=09I know UT is not in the exact situation, but this may make sense for the=
m.=20
The only time I thought the UT offense looked really good this year was rig=
ht=20
when Major Applewhite first came in against Louisiana-Lafayette and drove=
=20
straight down the field. And, Major took almost every snap in the shotgun (=
at=20
least the first drive). I know it was against an inferior opponent that was=
=20
probably taken by surprise, but they showed more on those drives with Major=
=20
in the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season (so=
=20
far).=20
=09
=09I believe you CAN win in college football with an unbalanced attack. FSU=
 has=20
done it with primarily passing, and I can't begin to name all the OU and=20
Nebraska-type teams that have won conference/national titles with=20
one-dimensional offenses. Also, the shotgun helps Major's biggest liability=
 -=20
his mobility. Personally, I don't care which QB is used this season - in th=
e=20
shotgun or not, but I really wish Mack Brown would just choose one and stic=
k=20
with him. =20
=09?? Aaron Ruhnow=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think you will continue to see the shotgun used only in speci=
fic=20
situations. The Texas coaches are too committed to being a balanced offense=
=20
that can run out of multiple sets. I do like the shotgun. The Buffalo Bills=
=20
used it all the time while they were going to all those Super Bowls. You ca=
n=20
do a lot with it. But it probably won't become a fixture in Austin.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Do you think that the pressure and expectations of Texas fans are go=
ing=20
to be too much for Mack Brown to handle? It appears he is already crumbling=
.=20
If he thinks people are hammering him now, what will it be like if he drops=
=20
this year's game to A=02?and suffers four losses?=20
=09?? Mike McDonald=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  : I hope it won't be too much for Mack Brown. He's a good perso=
n and=20
works really hard. I think he needs to just let some of this stuff wash ove=
r=20
him and forget about it. I think he has gotten into a rut lately where he=
=20
senses that every question has negative overtones. So now he is answering=
=20
every question by acknowledging his critics with some kind of remark.=20
=09
=09He has done more for Texas than UT will ever know. He has reshaped the=
=20
mindset of the university with the positive outlook he has brought to the=
=20
football team. Games are selling out. Players are coming to Austin. The kid=
s,=20
for the most part, are good kids.=20
=09
=09There's no need for Mack to draw a line in the sand and allow a few nega=
tive=20
voices to bring him down or cast a shadow over all the progress he has made=
.=20
If he moves on, the media and the critics will move on, too. If he harps on=
=20
criticism and keeps bringing it up in his answers, the media has no=20
alternative but to report it. It becomes a wicked circle.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: David Aaron was a receiver that came out of Marshall a few years bac=
k. I=20
know he also went to UT for track but he was a great receiver in high schoo=
l.=20
I saw him on the sidelines a few times but he never got much playing time. =
I=20
was thinking he should be a senior this year. Do you know what ever happene=
d=20
to him?=20
=09?? Jeff, Marshall, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Aaron is just running track this year. He has left the football=
=20
team.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Is it just me , or does the football field look a little bit torn up=
? It=20
just looks really dry and during the game a lot of turf gets thrown up.=20
=09?? Mark V.=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  UT officials say it's the drought and the fact that the UT team=
=20
practices on the field on Thursdays. But, I agree. I think the field looks=
=20
worse this season than it did last season (and we had a drought and the tea=
m=20
practiced on it last year, too).=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is up with all the negative press that Mack Brown and the Horns=
 have=20
been getting lately? From exercising their right to buy out of the Hawaii=
=20
game to losing their chance at a national title to running up the score in=
=20
the U of H game, and finally, to wanting the U of H game moved from a high=
=20
school stadium to a real college stadium where real fans can see a football=
=20
game.
=09
=09I'm not sure about Dallas, but here in Houston Mack and Co. have been ge=
tting=20
drilled for everything I listed above and more (QB rotation). It just seems=
=20
like everyone in the media, and even some our own fans, want to find=20
something negative to heap on the program.
=09
=09In my opinion, Mack and the rest of the team do not deserve this. Mack, =
his=20
coaches and the players have been nothing short of genuine and up-front wit=
h=20
the media and the public. They have expressed confidence, but never boasted=
=20
about their greatness. In fact, they have been the epitome of humility. Do=

=09
=09 BROWN:  It does seem to be a ridiculous truth that when we build someth=
ing=20
up, we inevitably end up tearing it down. Maybe the sense is that the=20
storybook season of 1998 and the victory over Nebraska last year built up t=
oo=20
big of expectations. The three losses at the end of last year did nothing t=
o=20
burst the bubble and then when UT comes out flat this year, everyone=20
re-evaluated and said, ""Wait, they really aren't that good.""
=09
=09Mack Brown had been telling people to reduce their expectations. But whe=
n the=20
star falls, people want to be the first to say it's falling. Then, they wan=
t=20
to add their own wrinkle as to why it's falling. So people look for cracks =

=09

itself. But inevitably there is a settling period.
=09
=09I think the people who are quick to say that Texas isn't as good as we=

see how Mack Brown and the vocal minority of critics handle things from=20
here. =20

=09
=09
=09 Q: Do you think Chris Simms would have benefited from a redshirt year? =
I=20
realize we were thin at quarterback last year and it was probably not an=20
option, but I look back at Major Applewhite and it appears to me he benefit=
ed=20
from a redshirt year in which his only responsibility was to learn the=20
system. When he came in as a redshirt freshman, he was ready to go. Thanks=
=20
for your insightful newsletter. =20
=09?? Michael R. Johnson, Houston, Texas =20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Sure, I think most players benefit from a redshirt year unless =
they=20
are Michael Vick. There was no way a redshirt season was going to happen fo=
r=20
Simms, however. Simms wants to spend just four years in college, and UT=20
coaches needed a backup for Applewhite. There is no question Applewhite=20
benefited from his redshirt season.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I'm really sick of all this negative stuff from a vocal minority of=
=20
fair-weather fans. They sound like a bunch of whining Aggies.=20
=09
=09Having said that, I still can't help but wonder if we don't have a probl=
em=20
with our offensive line coach. According to the UT media guide, Coach Tim=
=20
Nunez has had very little experience as an offensive line coach prior to=20
coming here. He didn't play that position either. There is no track record =
of=20
having actually developed a line, since he inherited experienced lines at=
=20
both Marshall and UT.=20
=09
=09This group clearly hasn't improved, even though it was a major source of=
=20
concern after last season. Nunez may be a fine coach and a great recruiter,=
=20
but does anyone think that he is one of the top O-line coaches in the=20
country? Is he the one who we want developing the fine group of incoming li=
ne=20
recruits we have committed for next year?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Patience. Don't fire a coach before it gets to mid-season. If t=
he=20
offensive line doesn't show any progress by the end of the year, then it's=
=20
time to talk about whether coaches have done their jobs. Nunez was coaching=
=20
this line when it beat Nebraska last year, so let's give him some time to=
=20
work with these guys.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What's the scoop on playing UH at Robertson Stadium next year? Can T=
exas=20
(a la Hawaii) threaten to cancel the game with Houston unless it is played =
in=20
the Astrodome or Rice Stadium? Also, how can either school afford to give u=

=09?? Chris Barbee, El Campo, Texas =20

of an old Southwest Conference matchup. After UT canceled the Hawaii game, =

=20

=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I live in Odessa and I use to see Roy Williams do punt returns. Why =
not=20
let  him return some punts?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown doesn't like to put freshmen back on punt returns un=
til=20
at least mid-season. After mid-season, he argues that freshmen aren't=20
freshmen anymore. So, perhaps after mid-season, if UT is not making any=20
progress on punt returns, we'll see some new faces back there. I would love=
=20
to see what Williams can do, although I doubt that coaches would put him ba=
ck=20
there. And I would really like to see Nathan Vasher back there. Heck, I wou=
ld=20
like to see Nathan Vasher everywhere. From what I have seen, the kid is=20
fearless with tons of confidence. We'll see.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Before the UT/Oklahoma State game, I thought that Mack Brown would s=
tart=20
shuffling the quarterbacks less often - giving them a quarter or two instea=
d=20
of two or three series each - in order to begin to establish some sort of=
=20
consistency. (In your Sept. 25 column, you also said this should happen.) I=
n=20
the game, Chris Simms started, but was pulled early after an interception,=
=20
and Applewhite played until well into the fourth quarter. The TV announcers=
=20
even wondered aloud if Simms was hurt in some way, since he didn't get back=
 =20
in until late in the game.=20
=09
=09My question is: Was this a message to Simms in some way, due to his poor=
=20
early performance? Or was this somewhat scripted in advance in order to giv=
e=20
Applewhite the reigns? It certainly appears that the coaches have more=20
confidence in Applewhite based on the situations they put him in. =20
=09?? Rick Highfill. Naperville, Ill.=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I sincerely think that the coaches have been trying to give Sim=
ms=20
every chance to thrive and possibly win the job. After four games, it's cle=
ar=20
he hasn't won the job outright. Now, coaches have to decide if this rotatio=
n=20
is really the best thing for the team and its leadership. I think they will=
=20
rely more on Applewhite in the next two games and thus kind of disprove the=
ir=20
own theories about having two starters.=20
=09
=09The hard part about the public relations in this situation is that once =
you=20
say you have two starters, it's a real blow to one once you say that you no=
w=20
only have one starter. I think the coaches will continue to say they have t=
wo=20
starters and play Simms out of fear of an injury affecting Applewhite. I=20
don't know if that's the right answer. Applewhite grew on the job without a=
ny=20
game training before Richard Walton went down in 1998. So who knows?=20
=09
=09I would think the coaches will again rotate after the OU and Colorado ga=
mes=20
because they will face teams (Missouri, Baylor, Texas Tech and Kansas) that=
=20
they will probably be favored to beat. At that point, if you're UT, you jus=

hope that the rotation doesn't hurt the team's offensive progress heading=
=20
into the A=02?game and post-season.=20

Good Morning, Eric-

I assume you received my message yesterday but were  too busy to respond.
That's o.k. As a postscript though, I bought  your Dad a new Marine
sweatshirt so you can keep the other one. And, I got  another bill from
Blockbuster for late fees. Perhaps it would be best if  you get your own

Hi everyone,

I will be *walking to cure diabetes* on November 5th, and was hoping each of 
you could donate on my behalf.  As is written below, 84% of all donations to 
JDF go directly to diabetes research.  Wouldn't you feel good about giving to 
such an efficient organization and honorable cause?  I'm sure you all need a 
tax write-off too, right? :)  You can use a copy of your canceled check for 
tax purposes.  

Also, if you donate $25 or more, you will get an excelr JDF T-shirt.  Of 
course, donations of any amount will be greatly appreciated.  Feel free to 
forward this message to others who might be interested in donating, as well.

I will be making the rounds next week to get a head start on collecting, so 
please email me if you'd like to contribute and bring a check made payable to 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.

Thanks in advance for your participation!

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the excelr team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing excelr and will be excelr's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

excelr continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  excelr's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  excelr has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 excelr 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

at=20
tailback. What happened to tailback by committee? It seems like we could us=
e=20
a bigger back (given the lack of blocking prowess by the O-line).=20
=09?? Bob Nance=20
=09
=09
=09
=09 BROWN:  Good question. The coaches took a good look at everyone in the=
=20
Houston game. They came away thinking that Kenny Hayter needs some more=20
carries. They still think that Ivan Williams is developing the toughness=20
needed to run in college. In the Louisiana-Lafayette game, coaches thought =
he=20
was running tentatively.=20
=09
=09Just as an aside, Hodges Mitchell says the running game is going to cut =
loose=20
this week. He says this season has been just like last season. For three=20
games, the running game has been Nikes stuck in glue. But he says this week=
=20
is the week. If it is, there would be no better confidence-builder than to =
do=20
it against the nation's top rushing defense. OSU is giving up just 30.3 yar=
ds=20
per game rushing this season. (Texas is fourth nationally against the run,=
=20
yielding 47.0 ypg). I think it will be tough sledding for the UT RBs this=
=20
week. Should be a good passing game, though.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Many of us who discuss this frequently still question the play-calli=

Davis as offensive coordinator. Any comments?=20
=09?? Reggie Reeves=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Davis is not the problem. His offenses routinely rate among the=
=20
nation's best in either rushing, passing or total offense. This season, UT =
is=20
fourth nationally in pass offense (366.5 yards per game). The running game=
=20
stinks. But he has gotten the passing game to the top with a quarterback=20
rotation that appears to have kept both Major Applewhite and Chris Simms fr=
om=20
peaking and with receivers who are barely old enough to shave.=20
=09
=09Davis is in constant contact with Gary Kubiak of the Denver Broncos. The=
=20
Broncos are considered one of the most cutting-edge offenses in the NFL.=20
Davis is constantly tapping into Kubiak and trying to bring in new wrinkles=
=20
to the UT offense. I don't know if anyone works harder than he does. Plus,=
=20
the quarterbacks love him. Even if they don't love this rotation, they love=
=20
him. I have seen no signs that this rotation has eroded that relationship.
=09
=09Davis is solid. In fact, if there is a UT coach who could leave the staf=

Davis.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: In your first newsletter I asked you why is everyone so excited abou=
t=20
this year's team when they showed last year that they could not run the=20
football. Against the big boys, you better have more balance. You replied=
=20
that the line is one year older and should be better. No, Chip, sorry, but=
=20
they are less than a year older since they struggled at the end of the seas=
on=20
with running and picking up blitzes. Now, not to say I told you so, but it =
is=20
still a serious problem that you sports writers overlooked and got too caug=
ht=20
up in the QB hype and the great receiving corps. Shame on you.=20
=09
=09Maybe that offensive line is not as great as you guys thought? I see UT =
going=20
8-3 this year and hanging around at 15th, which is where they should be. Th=
ey=20
are still young and not hungry enough as evidenced by poor starts against=
=20
really bad teams. Horn fans and sportswriters need to be a bit more patient=
=20
this year and take off their blinders. Maybe being a sportswriter during my=
=20
days at UT helped me see through the hype. Hook'em! =20
=09?? Larry, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I thought this offensive line would be much better than it's sh=
own=20
this season, but I wouldn't give up on them. Everyone saw UT's third=20
possession against Houston in which Leonard Davis and Derrick Dockery - two=
=20
guys I think have to take leadership roles on that line - allowed a DE to g=
o=20
untouched right between them and stuff the running back for a 6-yard loss.=
=20
=09
=09This kind of play should be a deep concern for UT coaches. Dockery has b=
een=20
sick, and is still trying to regain weight lost while out with an infected=
=20
cyst. Davis has struggled to get chemistry with Dockery's backup, Tillman=
=20
Holloway. Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says the line tends to play bett=
er=20
in the second half than it does in the first half because it takes a while=
=20
for them to get on the same page and see what the defense is doing. That,=
=20
however, may be too late against a good team.=20
=09
=09The old adage goes that you have to have a senior-laden offensive line t=
o=20
have any real chance at a national title or Top 10 success. So far, that=20
appears to be true. Texas' O-line has just two seniors (Leonard Davis, Cory=

(Derrick Dockery). =20

=20
why Chris is not playing more than he is?=20

would love to go back in and correct it, even though his rotation is up and=
=20
Major Applewhite is coming in. The questions for both guys are constant.=20
=09
=09Simms also said there are times when he knows it's his last series befor=
e=20
Applewhite comes in, and it's third-and-17 and he's tempted to throw a deep=
=20
pass to try to make something happen and stay in the game. Against Houston,=
=20
he had a situation like that and opted to throw a 6-yard route to B.J.=20
Johnson, the safer choice. ""It was the smarter thing to do,"" he said.=20
=09
=09My theory was that the coaches would try to get Simms as much playing ti=
me as=20
possible in the first four games to show what he can do. And then, come=20
Oklahoma, the coaches settle on one QB. After the OSU game, I think the=20
coaches need to settle on one guy for awhile and give credence to the=20
hot-hand policy Brown said he would employ this season. The question is, wi=
ll=20
Simms get enough snaps to show he deserves to be that guy? Right now, coach=

=09Q: Major Applewhite has become the red-headed straight-A student who is=
=20
having to contend with the jock favored son. Mack Brown has to appease alum=
s=20
and parents (Simms') who want to see Phil Simms' son as UT's QB. I think wh=
at=20
is being done is a ... (I have to say  it) ... a Major Injustice.=20
=09 ?? A ""Major"" Longhorn fan from Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think there is a misconception out there that Phil Simms is=
=20
constantly calling Mack Brown, demanding that he give Chris more playing=20
time. Or that Mack Brown made some deal with the Simms family, assuring=20
everyone that Chris would get playing time. None of that is true.=20
=09
=09According to Chris, the only assurance he received is that he would be=
=20
allowed to =20
=09
=09compete  for the starting job. So far, that's what's happened. Now, whet=
her=20
Chris continues to make the most of his playing time and shows that he=20
deserves to get substantial minutes remains to be seen.=20
=09
=09It's hard to argue with Applewhite's results so far this season. Here's =
a=20
breakdown of their stats: Applewhite is 49 of 87 passing (56.3 percent=20
completion rate) for 729 yards with 6 TDs and 3 interceptions. He has a QB=
=20
rating of 142.57. Simms has completed 19 of 36 passes (52.8 percent) for 25=
7=20
yards with three TDs and three interceptions. His QB rating is 123.58. But=
=20
Brown is not trying to appease Simms as much as he is trying to see what=20
Simms can do.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Is the quarterback rotation hurting the UT offense?=20
=09?? Sara McFadden=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I asked Major Applewhite if he was playing up to his ability th=
is=20
season. He said no. I asked him if Chris Simms was playing as well as he=20
could. Applewhite said no. If one or the other was given the QB job until h=
e=20
lost the hot hand, you wonder if there might be some more rhythm to this=20
offense. But it's almost impossible to know.=20
=09
=09The players say it doesn't matter who is playing QB, they're both solid.=
 It=20
is hard to argue that Major shouldn't be the man. All he's done is win and=
=20
break records. Simms is still adjusting to college ball and not being ""the=
=20
man"" for the first time in his competitive life. Every time he has walked=
=20
onto a football field, he's been Phil Simms' kid and the top choice to play=
=20
QB. Now, he's battling with a guy who has Major results.=20
=09
=09I thought that the rotation was hurting the offense. But offensive=20
coordinator Greg Davis justifiably pointed out to me that UT has passed for=
=20
more yards through three games this year than it did last year. So I decide=
d=20
to break everything down in the passing game, comparing UT's offense throug=
h=20
three games this year to the first three games of 1999. While Texas has mor=
e=20
passing yards (986 in 2000 to 940 in 1999) and more TD passes (9 in 2000 to=
 7=20
in 1999), the combined completion percentage of both QBs is down (55.3 in=
=20
2000 to 61.6 in 1999). UT also has more interceptions this year (6 in 2000 =
to=20
1 in 1999). And one of those picks was returned for a touchdown.=20
=09
=09I tend to think Applewhite's numbers would be much better if he were all=
owed=20
to start and stay in. Of course, Simms would have better numbers, too, if h=
e=20
got to play most of the game. But by sharing, I think both of their=20
production is down. Maybe it's just a matter of getting used to this=20
rotation. We'll see how long everyone can keep a positive attitude about=20
this. Davis said Tuesday he could see the team rotating both quarterbacks a=
ll=20
season long. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is the source of greater confusion for the O-line: opposing=20
defenses' tactics or Texas' own offensive scheme?  In other words, is the=

=20
simply being outplayed? =20
=09 ?? Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas=20

Brown said Louisiana-Lafayette, Stanford and Houston did not use defensive=
=20
schemes that they had shown in previous games.=20
=09
=09Brown's contention is that other teams can make their season by beating =
UT,=20
so they gamble and throw a bunch of risky blitzes at the Longhorns. Against=

n=20
nothing this year that suggests anything close to that this season.=20
=09
=09I cannot blame the O-line and here is why: For a prototypical ""scat-back=
,""=20
Hodges seems to run to traffic. There were several plays last week where a=
=20
quick step one way or the other would have gotten him to more open field.=
=20
Instead he would run right into the defense. Does he just not have the=20

n.=20
Last year, Mitchell broke a couple draws on Oklahoma State and ran for 149=

praise with zeal? To illustrate my point, Coach Brown became terse while=20

losses in five games, 100 net yards rushing in five games, a probable QB=20
controversy and lest we not forget, yet another blocked punt). Conversely,=

Coach Brown will devour praise with carnivorous delight! Coach Brown cites=
=20
the team's emotional psyche as ""... being fragile,"" yet Coach Brown fueled=
=20
this euphoria in the players during spring drills and prior to the season.=
=20
=09
=09Is it not the coach's responsibility to provide stability to the team's=

os in=20
that one!) during the 1980s? =20
=09?? David Newburn=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown says all of his responses to criticism are simply to=
 help=20
his players and protect them from getting unfairly ripped. Brown is very=20
sensitive to criticism. If someone criticizes the running game, he reminds=
=20
them that the passing game is rated No. 4 nationally. When someone question=
s=20
the quarterback rotation, he tells people to be positive instead of negativ=
e=20
and contends that the players are fine with it - only the media is not.  I=
=20
honestly think that Brown tries to see everything in such a positive light=
=20
that he becomes personally offended at criticism and negative thinking. He=
=20
forgets that people are deeply, deeply passionate about their team. That=20
people get mad, really mad, when their team loses a game it shouldn't. Or=
=20
worse, when the team plays really lousy in losing a game it shouldn't (see=
=20
Stanford).=20
=09
=09I think Brown also believes that because he is so forthcoming in public=
=20
appearances and with the media and has done so much to restore the traditio=
n=20
to UT, that he feels betrayed when fans or the press criticize parts of his=
=20
team. He wants fans to rally behind their team, no matter what, and be the=
=20
first to pick up the team when it's down. Not pile on.=20
=09
=09But people are going to get angry when his team gives up five sacks, get=

he=20

The first deals with punt returns. I can respect Coach Mack Brown wanting t=

=20
why bring in so much talent and speed if you aren't going to use it? Why do=
es=20
Hodges Mitchell continue to return punts?=20
=09
=09He is too much of a dance-around, east-west runner to be successful in t=
he=20
kicking game. I realize he averaged close to 10-yds a return Saturday, but=
=20
his average was more a product of Houston's poor field position. We need a=
=20

=20
minutes, why not trust them with the return game?=20
=09
=09Secondly, why do we pull Casey Hampton on third-down passing situations?=

I received this email and wanted to share the photo.

Beautiful but sad.

This awsome picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest here in
Montana on August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks,
Alaska  by the name of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he
was working  while he took the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it
so he  should  at  least be recognized as the photographer of this once
in a lifetime shot.

The third highest because of one Extraordinary week...  My ""Shitty""
receivers have outscored Toomer, he blows this year, I have no need for
another blow hard receiver.  Jeff George has the same value as last week..
Johnson is injury prone and one game will not make up for the last 3.  He
will falter again.

alright, when you find out that mine is the best bid for an injury prone
player that has been unable to complete an entire season in his career, you
can come back to me and maybe toomer and garner (the third highest scoring
back in the league) will still be there.

The City League has once again revised our schedule.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the 
team we beat last week, three times during the season and the Raiders only 
once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.  

Have a good weekend,

Ok- since you finally asked-

It is this book entitled ""The Story of a Lifetime- A Keepsake of Personal 
Memoirs"".  

Here is the description that was given:

""Give this book to someone whose story you want to know . . . It invites the 
reader to share memories, facts, philosophies, beliefs, knowledge, and wisdom 
gained from a lifetime of experience.  Hundreds of questions encourage 
thoughtful reponses.  When complete, it's a priceless heirloom for future 
generations.""

I thought it was a neat gift idea- so that your mom can share her thoughts 
with you, and you (your children, your children's children) would have them 
when (unfortunately) she is not around anymore.

I ordered one for my mom also.

Hopefully it will be as neat as it sounds.

=09Every year since 1983, Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g=
ames=20
of the season. That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa=
st=20
17 years - usually before Texas-OU weekend. =20
=09
=09 Orangebloods spend winter, spring and summer discussing the impact of n=
ew=20
recruits, the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning=
=20
starters. They spend money on season tickets, airplane tickets and alumni=
=20
luncheon tickets. They dream big dreams, and then by October, the high hope=
s=20
have usually come crashing down.=20
=09
=09 Only three times since 1983 has Texas opened the season 3-0: 1984, 1985=
 and=20
1994. Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie (1984) or=
=20
losses (1985 and 1994). In each of those seasons, Texas ended up with four=
=20
losses. =20
=09
=09 In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 1990 and a 10-2=
-1=20
run in 1995, the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season,=
=20
respectively. Before Texas can dream about winning a national title, the=20
Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss.=20
=09
=09=20
=09
=09
=09Longhorn Q & A=20
=09 Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of l=
ast=20
season) it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue. There =
is=20
also no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think th=
e=20
best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20
offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving=
=20
us. =20
=09
=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b=
est=20
athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience=
d=20
players, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the=
=20
ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=
rt=20
Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and=
=20
play a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a=
nd=20
Hodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback=20
through the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people=
=20
miss in the open field.=20
=09
=09I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter=
back.=20
Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and=
=20
probably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chanc=
e=20
to display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if=
=20
we are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season=20
slipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20
=09 ?? The Jackson residence=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out=
 -=20
change coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telli=
ng=20
this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to=
o=20
much change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to=
=20
this Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some=
=20
resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all=
=20
the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and=
=20
Notre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th=
en=20
lost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,=
=20
Oklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's=
=20
opponent, Houston.=20
=09
=09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread =
was=20
that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=
=20
loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=
e=20
to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20
could go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha=
rd=20
team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=
ns=20
are not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to=
=20
his team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will b=
e=20
scrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire=20
being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state. Bu=
t=20
changes will have to be made constructively and gradually.=20

=09
=09Q: What's going on with the quarterbacks?=20
=09?? Mitch Golding=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  As the QBs turn. This week, it appears Chris Simms will start=
=20
because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the=
=20
trend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll=
=20
see how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic =
in=20
his play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20
miraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see=
=20
what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20
=09
=09to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20
=09
=09Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac=
k=20
Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of=
=20
his experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. =
He=20
said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms. It would seem to =
me=20
that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense, lig=
ht=20
it up and get on a roll when you are alternating, but I'll continue to watc=
h=20
like everyone else. =20
=09
=09I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli=
na=20
with success. Of course, with those QBs (Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf)=
,=20
Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t=
o=20
prepare for Davenport's scrambling and Keldorf's passing. With Simms and=20
Applewhite you pretty much get the same style. With Keldorf and Davenport,=
=20
you also had injuries dictate a few starts.=20
=09?

=09
=09 Q: Can you tell us what influenced Mack Brown's decision regarding the=
=20
quarterbacks against Stanford?=20
=09?? Nels Marshall=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Here are Brown's exact words: ""Experience. We were in a tight=
=20
football game and Major (Applewhite) has been around a long time. I was pro=
ud=20
- even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter - that =
we=20
didn't panic. I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job=
=20
of coming back and giving us a chance to win. Sometimes youth doesn't look=
=20
like it is trying because they're nervous. Instead, they are trying too har=
d=20
and get uptight. Our team tried hard. As negative as people make Saturday=
=20
night, it is one of those things that you have to grow from."" =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I'm glad we have two great QBs. My question is, are the receivers ha=
ving=20
any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a=20
left-handed or right-handed QB?=20
=09?? Dave Stastny, Austin=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch=
ing=20
the ball. They do, however, say that Chris Simms' ball will come a little=
=20
faster and a little harder than Major Applewhite's.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea=
r.=20
What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts? I know=
=20
that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons, but can they al=
so=20
apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount =
of=20
time? =20
=09?? Chad Graham=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  No. Once a freshman plays in a game, even for one play and he d=
oes=20
not suffer a season-ending injury, the chance for a redshirt is out the=20
window. =20

=09Jermain Anderson =20
=09
=09Q: Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b=
ack=20
to linebacker? If I remember correctly, he played LB in high school at Texa=
s=20
City. He seems to still have good speed, but also a problem putting on the=
=20
necessary weight to play defensive end. It just seems like he might be bett=
er=20
suited for the outside linebacker rotation, especially considering the=20
progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton, Cole Pittman and=
=20
Adam Doiron. =20
=09 ?? Micah Hurt=20
=09
=09
=09
=09 BROWN:  Coaches don't think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker. =
They=20
are pleased with the depth at linebacker, as well. They like Anderson's=20
instincts as a pass rusher. They are still working on his ability to stop t=
he=20
run.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn=
=20
football schedule in your letter each week. My husband, Mark, is a diehard=
=20
Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in 1972. Through thick and thin, he h=
as=20
remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner=
=20
fans. Of course, he does his fair share (and probably more) of bragging abo=
ut=20
the Longhorns. =20
=09?? Barbara and Mark Harper=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  As far as the schedule, UT's remaining games are:=20

=09Hodges Mitchell =20
=09
=09Q: Don't know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y=
our=20
column, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and=
=20
wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=
=20
However, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team ""up"" sometime=
s=20
and can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20
=09
=09About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible =
for=20
the offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on=
e,=20
I put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges=
=20
Mitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis=
=20
love Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of=
=20
those yards were ""move=20
=09
=09 the chains"" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground=
 and=20
protect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but=
=20
all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=
e=20
run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20
=09
=09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive=
=20
tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t=
he=20
linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there=
=20
with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a=
=20
receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.
=09
=09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim=
e=20
against Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury=
=20
may have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up=
=20
with opponent's wideouts.
=09
=09How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were=
 all=20
over the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What i=
s=20
up with the blocked punts? UT should be really, really embarrassed. Does=20
Stockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Ca=
n=20
anyone at UT block?
=09
=09Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls? Several tim=
es=20
the camera caught clear holds by Stanford's line. Why on earth would you ru=
n=20
up the middle, on your own goal line against two of the best DTs you'll pla=
y=20
against?=20
=09?? Andrew Bowen=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20
incredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday=
's=20
events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat=
=20
the team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any=
=20
other part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20
learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20
=09
=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a=
nd=20
needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20
fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl=
y=20
isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di=
d=20
beat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop=
s,=20
and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question=
=20
about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwe=
d=20
on straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of t=
he=20
team.=20
=09
=09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the=
=20
quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still=
=20
working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'=
s=20
no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are=
=20
the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=
=20
line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20
Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.=
=20
=09
=09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =
was=20
taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about=
=20
that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20
deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20
blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20
Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20
=09
=09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=
=20
games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=
=20
The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl=
=20
Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=
e=20
who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B=
ut=20
that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because=
=20
one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed =
to=20
block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play=
er=20
has been chewed out every which way.
=09
=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow=
n,=20
who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=
y=20
anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still=
=20
have a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so=
=20
early will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss=20
constructively or destructively.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding=
. I=20
know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player =
in=20
the country in 1998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against=
=20
teams this year. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe this week against Stanford. M=
y=20
question is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker=
=20
where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized=
=20
and average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seems our=20
recruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!=20
=09?? Ernie McAnally=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov=
e.=20
But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel=
d=20
right away as a defensive end. Coaches also feel that his body (6-5, 260) i=
s=20
perfect for the DE position. He's tall, athletic, fast and has long arms. I=
n=20
time, coaches feel Redding will develop into an All-America player. But the=
re=20
is no question that he has struggled against the run. He made some big play=
s=20
against Stanford, recording six tackles, three of them for losses and=20
blocking an extra point attempt. He is just a sophomore. Over this season a=
nd=20
the next two years, he should only get better.=20

LaDainian Tomlinson. How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky=20
Williams' run for the Heisman?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Texas didn't spend that much money at all. They produced a few=

postcards, a video and a CD-ROM screen saver to send out to the national=20

in his 10 years at UNC and won four of them.=20
=09
=09A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas=20

seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha=

The City League has once again revised our schedule.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the 
team we beat last week, three times during the season and the Raiders only 
once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.  

Have a good weekend,
Brian

Redskins to stick with Johnson at quarterback 
 Sept. 19, 2000
By Len Pasquarelli
SportsLine.com Senior Writer
 



Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter 
interceptions by Brad Johnson, the Washington Redskins will stick with their 
starting quarterback for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants, 
SportsLine.com has confirmed. 

""If it was just (a problem) with Brad, then we'd look at it, but that's not 
the case,"" coach Norv Turner said. ""But it goes beyond just the quarterback 
position. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general."" 

   
Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the 
unbeaten Giants.(AP)   

In the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday 
night, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for 
the key matchup against the undefeated Giants. The Washington offense, one of 
the league's most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No. 2 overall and second in 
scoring, has been sporadic at best in three games. 

A seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson 
has five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth 
quarters of those losses. He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or 
his execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that 
it might be time for a change. 

One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to 
throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries. The Redskins have 
only three completions this year of more than 20 yards, and the longest is 26 
yards. In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to 
tailback Stephen Davis. 

The Redskins, who averaged 12.7 yards per completion in 1999 with both 
starting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic 9.2 
yards per catch this season. 

But Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at 
this point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new 
focus more than a new starter. 

""There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks),"" he said. ""Right 
now, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere 
else.""

Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 09/19/00
Sepculation is increasing that George may get a chance to start after Brad
Johnson struggled against Dallas. The rifle-armed QB may put a jolt into the
Washington offense if he indeed gets a chance to start.

Please forward to the owner of Brad Johnson.

The heat rate is going to depend on the type of fuel and the construction date of the unit.  Unfortunately, most of that info is proprietary.

Hey Bass,

I have a question and I am hoping you can help me.  I am wanting to compile a list of all the different types of power plants and their respective heat rates to determine some sort of generation ratio.

i.e.	Coal		4 mmbtu = 1 MW
	Simple Cycle	11 mmbtu = 1 MW

Please let me know if you can help me or point me to someone who can.  Just FYI...Bryan suggested that I call you so blame him as you curse me under your breath right now.

Thanks,
Lisa

THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

  CLASSIC  VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house
  and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks  the ant is a
  fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant
  is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out
  in the cold.


  MODERN VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering  heat all summer long, building his
  house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks
  he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter,
  the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why
  the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while  others are cold and
  starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of  the shivering
  grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home  with a table
  filled with food.

  ""America"" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a
  country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?

  Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah  with the grasshopper, and everybody cries
  when they sing ""It's Not Easy Being  Green.""

  Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening
  News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they
  can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by
  those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to
  it as ""Temperatures of the 80's""

  Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in  front of the ant's house where the
  news stations film the group singing ""We shall overcome."" Jesse then has the
  group kneel down to pray to God for  the grasshopper's sake.

  Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten
  rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls  for an immediate tax hike
  on the ant to make him pay his ""fair share.""

  Finally, the EEOC drafts the ""Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act,""

  retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is  fined for failing to
  hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having  nothing left to
  pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by  the government.

  Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation
  suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a  panel of federal
  judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients
  who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM when
  there are no talk shows scheduled.

  The ant loses the case. The story  ends as we see the grasshopper finishing
  up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is
  in,which just happens to be the ant's old  house, crumbles around him since
  he doesn't maintain it.

  The ant has  disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper
  bought by selling  most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton
  standing before a wildly  applauding group of Democrats announcing that a
  new era of ""fairness"" has dawned  in America.

  The grasshopper is found dead in a drug-related incident and  the house, now
  abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the  once
  peaceful neighborhood.

  She explained the situation and Saint Peter said he'd get right on it. The

Lessons of the Geese


This Fall, when you see geese heading south for the winter flying along in 
""V"" formation, you might consider what science has discovered as to why they 
fly that way.


FACT: As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an ""uplift"" for the bird 
immediately following. By flying in a ""V"" formation, the whole flock has at 
least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flew on it's own.
LESSON: People who share a common direction and sense of community can get 
where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on 
the thrust of one another.


FACT: When a goose flies out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and 
resistance of trying to go it alone. It quickly gets back into formation to 
take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front of it.
LESSON: If we have as much common sense as a goose, we stay in formation with 
those headed where we want to go. We are willing to accept their help and 
give our help to others. It is harder to do something alone than together.


FACT: When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation, and 
another goose flies to the point position.
LESSON: It is sensible to take turns doing the hard and demanding tasks and 
sharing leadership. As with geese, people are interdependent of each others 
skills, capabilities, and unique arrangements of gifts, talents, or resources.


FACT: The geese flying in formation honk from behind to encourage those up 
front to keep up their speed.
LESSON: We need to make sure our honking is encouraging. In groups where 
there is encouragement, the production is much greater. The power of 
encouragement (to stand by one's heart or core values and encourage the heart 
and core of others) is the quality of honking we seek. We need to make sure 
our honking is encouraging and not discouraging.


FACT: When a goose gets sick, wounded, or shot down, two other geese will 
drop out of formation with that goose and follow it down to lend help and 
protection. They stay with the fallen goose until it dies or is able to fly 
again. Then, they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch 
up with their flock.
LESSON: If we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by our colleagues and 
each other in difficult times as well as in good!

Dog bites threaten home insurance
Homeowner coverage may be cancelled if your pooch is considered too aggressive


Charles V. Tines / The Detroit News

MetLife no longer writes coverage for people who own a pit bull or four other 
dogs with attitudes.

By Charlie Cain / News Lansing Bureau Chief

    A sizable increase in the number -- and severity -- of dog bites in Metro 
Detroit is increasingly forcing insurance companies to cancel homeowner 
policies at homes where the family pooch has displayed a bad attitude.
    At least one national insurance company, MetLife Auto & Home, no longer 
writes homeowner coverage for people who own any of five different breeds of 
large, often aggressive, dogs: pit bulls, rottweilers, chow chows, German 
shepherds and bull terriers.
    ""Our overall position is that if you have one of those breeds in your 
household, we will not insure you because we don't believe there's a way to 
match the risk with the rate,"" said Richard Bernstein, a MetLife 
vice-president.
    ""Dog bites tend to be difficult cases, emotionally traumatic and costly.""
    The Insurance Information Institute in New York said insurers now 
shoulder a quarter of the record $1 billion cost associated with dog bites -- 
from medical treatment to ""pain and suffering"" damage awards.
    A third of all homeowner claims result from dog bites; about 70 percent 
of insurance carriers won't renew coverage to a policyholder whose dog has 
bitten someone.
    ""We're seeing a surge of dog bite claims with pit bulls and rottweilers,"" 
said Mike Erwin, a spokesman for the institute, which represents about 350 
companies nationwide.
    ""Those are not just a nip, but a tearing of the skin that requires a lot 
more medical treatment and as a result, the costs go up.""
    Dogs were particularly aggressive in Detroit last year; the city reported 
1,574 dog bites -- up 38 percent from 1996.
    Macomb County reported 1,020 dog bites last year, up 9.5 percent from a 
year earlier.
    The Oakland County Animal Shelter, which covers much of the county, said 
the number of bites there remained constant at about 800.
    Nationally, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 4.7 
million dog bites were reported in 1997.
    Justin Harbert, a 4-year-old Warren boy, joined the growing list of 
victims last week when a neighbor's chow chow lunged at his throat. It took 
12 stitches to close the boy's wound in Bi-County Hospital.
    ""It didn't really dawn on me that there might be a problem,"" said his 
father, Gary Harbert, who was taking his son to breakfast and stopped briefly 
at the neighbor's house.
    ""I saw my son go to pet the dog and the dog jumped across the table and 
went for his throat.""
    The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that nearly 
half of all children will be bitten by age 12.
    Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the Michigan Association of Insurance, 
said the larger dogs that people are buying now to protect their homes are a 
particular concern. Too often, the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy 
mills, he said.
    ""More people will be bitten by poodles and cocker spaniels than pit bulls 
this year simply because there are so many more of them,"" he said.
    ""But the serious injuries are caused by dogs like the pit bull. The 
increase in lawsuits is the result of the attacks by these large, aggressive 
animals.
    ""People want them for protection, but the problem is these dogs often 
don't know the difference between a burglar and the kid next door or the 
mailman. Those are the people who are being bit and those are the people that 
are suing.""
    Last year, 2,795 postal carriers were bitten and the U.S. Postal Service 
now is routinely suing dog owners. 
    Farmington Hills attorney Sam Bernstein said his office handles ""quite a 
few"" dog bite claims and he has seen ""a lot of gruesome attacks, particularly 
by dogs whose owners allow them to roam the neighborhood.""
    He said Michigan is like 30 other states with strict liability laws that 
say if your dogs bites someone, you're responsible.
    ""There seems to be much more serious injuries today among people who are 
bitten by dogs,"" Bernstein said.
    State Farm Insurance, Michigan's largest provider of homeowner insurance, 
said it had 441 dog bites claims last year, up nearly 41 percent from 1996.
    ""For the last two years, Michigan has been the fifth-highest state in the 
amount paid out in dog claims by State Farm,"" said John Carroll, a company 
spokesman.
    The insurer's Michigan costs last year were $81,367 in medical claims and 
another $3.27 million to settle liability claims.
    ""We don't deny coverage based on breed since any breed can be trained to 
bite,"" Carroll said. ""But after one bite, we insist the homeowner resolve the 
situation.
    ""The policy will be discontinued if they continue to keep the dog on 
premises.""
    Dan Hattaway, a dog bite expert at State Farm's national headquarters in 
Bloomington, Ill., said the company had 14,000 dog bite claims last year -- 
up 27 percent from 1996.

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed excelr Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  excelr's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.  I don't
know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be
sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.  So, if you
want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.

My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.  I don't
know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be
sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.  So, if you
want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.

September 6, 2000 WSJ

Bush vs. the Press
A Washington adage holds that a politician commits a ""gaffe"" when he
inadvertently tells the truth. This is how we read George W. Bush's
off-the-record aside that New York Times reporter Adam Clymer is a ""major
league"" you-know-what.

In that refreshingly incautious remark caught Monday by an open microphone,
Mr. Bush was admitting, albeit unintentionally, that his campaign has a
press problem. We aren't referring only to Mr. Clymer, whose performance
review has been ably undertaken by neo-liberal journalist Mickey Kaus at
kausfiles.com. We're talking about the general media double standard faced
by every prominent conservative politician.

As Democrat-turned-journalist Michael Barone has observed, the mainstream
media aren't pro-Democratic. They will sometimes take a Democrat to task,
especially if he violates a media shibboleth such as ""campaign-finance
reform."" But they are reliably anti-Republican. That is, in newsrooms across
the land there is noticeably greater skepticism, and often animosity, toward
politicians who are cultural conservatives or who want to restrict the scope
of federal power.

This rarely manifests itself in blatant partisanship or attacks. Instead the
slant shines through in the press pack's definition of what constitutes news
or the interpretation the pack puts on news. Consider the treatment of three
recent campaign episodes:

When Mr. Bush said back in the primaries that his favorite philosopher was
""Christ,"" he was downgraded on the spot by the press for pandering to the
""religious right."" The implication was that he couldn't possibly mean it.
But now Democrat and liberal Joe Lieberman is making a much more frequent
and vocal issue of his own religious faith, and the same media that scolded
Mr. Bush are writing long, thoughtful treatises on the role of religion in
politics. And any criticism of Mr. Lieberman is accompanied with the caveat
that the Orthodox Jew really is sincere. This is a double standard.

Or take Mr. Bush's recent decision to run a TV spot attacking Mr. Gore's
credibility. This was reported, in the New York Times and elsewhere, as
going ""negative,"" primarily as a response to Mr. Gore's rise in the polls.
But what about the weeks-long TV-ad hammering that Democrats have laid on
Mr. Bush -- for his Texas record, and even during the GOP convention on his
running mate's 15-year-old voting record? The Gore attacks were reported as
legitimate subjects of political debate. We happen to think all of these are
legitimate, but only Mr. Bush's got the good-housekeeping media's ""negative""
label.

Then there is the debate over Presidential debates. This back and forth is a
hardy perennial, and you'd think the press would merely let both sides duke
it out. But in the coverage we've seen, Mr. Bush's proposal to break from
the Commission on Presidential Debates mold is being treated as an attempt
to dodge debates or attract a smaller audience. Mr. Gore's decision to
renege on his pledges to debate on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and CNN's ""Larry
King Live"" don't get the same spin.

This criticism of Mr. Bush is especially galling when it comes from the
likes of ABC and CBS, who now whine that they won't carry debates held by
other networks. So much for their public-spiritedness. Their reaction shows
that the debate commission is less about designing a forum to educate voters
and more about dividing the commercial TV spoils equally. We hope Mr. Bush
sticks with his desire to have a less scripted, more open exchange with Mr.
Gore.

Mr. Bush has given signs before that he understands his party's media
problem better than most other Republicans. Indeed, we've long suspected
that his ""compassionate conservative"" theme was as much about media
management as policy. It was designed to deflect the inevitable media
portrayal of any Republican as a heartless, Gingrichian budget cutter. Mr.
Bush also stood up to the press pack when it sought to hound him about
rumors of youthful drug use.

We aren't suggesting that Mr. Bush should get into a pitched battle with the
press corps, and especially not with any one reporter. Our point is that Mr.
Bush won't be able to count on even-handed media coverage to carry his
battle to Mr. Gore. He's going to have to make his case directly, and not
too subtly, to voters over the heads of the media.

That means Mr. Bush would be better off doing more debates in several
forums. And, above all, it means setting his own agenda and strategy, no
matter if ankle-biters in the press corps call it ""negative.""

at how good of a job I did- with only being a rotator and having such limited 
work experience.  She said that after I finish my third rotation in EES she 
would like for me to consider taking a permanent position in her group.  We 
will talk about it more towards the end of this rotation.

Good afternoon. Mother suggested that maybe it  would be fun if the trip to 
see The University of Houston beat Texas @  Austin,were boys only. Say you, 
me and Jason. I suspect that has  to do?  with her ""don't give a do-do""

Dear Jason,
?
I know it has been two months since my  surgery.? I don't know why the 
feelings have finally surfaced.? I did  not even say anything to your father 
until today.? 
?
First of all, I expected to see 3 smiling faces  when I awoke in the recovery 
room.? I only saw one.? I was  devastated.? I will get over it but it has to 
run its course.? Nothing  would have prevented me from being by either one of 
your sides under similar  circumstances.? I know you have lives, work, etc., 
but you, especially,  always find time for friends in need, i.e, Donnita's 
mother and Donnita's  15-minute oral surgery.? Give me a break.?? But, the 
most heart  wrenching thing is, until today, you never gave it a second 
thought. How would  you have felt if I had not been there for you? The final 
blow, though, was the  realization that you would take time to be with 
somebody else's mother and take  an entire day off for Donnita's oral 
surgery.? Actions speak louder than  words.
?
I'll get over this.? In fact, I've gotten it  off my chest and this is the 
end of it.? But, I cannot help but wonder, and  I want you both to answer 
this truthfully, if it had been your father, would you  have been there?? 
Just curious.? You reap what you sow.? I guess  I was not very good at the 
sowing part.
?
Love, Mom

my predicament at running back will last me one week, maybe two.  I think 
that i have a good enough team to withstand a bad start and make it to the

Engram was easily in my top 30 or 25 recievers while shroeder was barely in 
my top 50.  Raymont Harris has been out of football for a while, and is on a 
team that won't run the ball much.  This move would maybe help my team the

LSU Is Ranked Party School Champ
Distinction Disappoints University  Officials
BATON ROUGE, La., Updated 9:13 p.m. CDT August 16, 2000 --It's a  distinction
officials at Louisiana State University wanted to avoid, but now  the word is
out: LSU has been ranked the No. 1 party school in the Princeton  Review of
the nation's top colleges.
Despite seminars on alcohol abuse and  new policies for fraternities and
sororities regarding alcohol consumption,  LSU edged out the University of
Alabama for the top spot. The University of  Texas ""won"" third place.
Chancellor Mark Emmert said LSU is no more a party  school than any other
university.
The Princeton ranking was disheartening  news to university officials still
shaken after the Aug. 19, 1997, death of  an LSU student who drank
excessively during a celebration of his acceptance  into a fraternity.
Brigham Young University was dubbed the top ""Stone Cold  Sober"" school in the
review.

The top 20 ""Party Schools,"" according to the Princeton Review:
1.  Louisiana State University
2. University of Alabama
3. University of  Texas
4. Florida State University
5. University of Colorado
6.  University of Tennessee
7. University of California at Santa Cruz
8.  Tulane University
9. University of Wisconsin
10. Ohio University,  Athens
11. University of New Hampshire
12. University of Michigan
13.  University of Vermont
14. Ohio State University
15. New York  University
16. Lehigh University
17. Southern Methodist University
18.  University of Florida
19. University of California at Santa Barbara
20.  Union College
The top 20 ""Stone Cold Sober Schools,"" according to the Princeton  Review:
1. Brigham Young University
2. Wheaton College
3. California  Institute of Technology
4. U.S. Naval Academy
5. U.S. Coast Guard  Academy
6. Samford University
7. Cooper Union
8. Wellesley  College
9. Mount Holyoke College
10. Calvin College
11. Haverford  College

   A new book that says men may beat their wives has caused an outcry in
Turkey.
   The Guardian newspaper reports that ""The Muslim's Handbook,"" written by
retired cleric Kemil Gubran, advised men not to hit too hard and to avoid
the face. It also said that if a man's wife is ill and he can't afford a
servant, he could take a second wife.
   The book was published by the state-funded Pious Foundation, which is
affiliated with Turkey's religious directorate. In the past decade, the
directorate -- which appoints Muslim clerics and dictates topics for
mosques -- has been presenting a modern interpretation of Islam to include
expanded roles and rights for women.
   ""I am outraged that such a book was published with state funds, with
money women paid in taxes,"" said Zuhal Krilic, the head of Kader, a group
promoting women in politics.
   A book published in Spain several weeks ago also said a Muslim man could
beat his wife -- and included tips and instructions -- although it
counseled that the best way to bring a woman in line was through verbal abuse.

Subject: I need your help!!

Michael Taylor is a summer intern from LSU, finance major, who has been 
working in Logistics for the Central Desk.  He will be at ENA for the next 
couple of weeks (through 8/11, I believe).  He has not had an opportunity to 
really see our business from the trading perspective or Risk perspective.  I 
had the opportunity to have lunch with Mike yesterday, and we brainstormed on 
some options to get him some exposure to these areas prior to leaving ENA.  
THis where I need your help!

Eric - As I always do, I sang your praises to Mike, and I thought you would 
be a good person for Mike to sit with to observe your current role in the 
analyst program on the Texas Trading Desk.  Additionally, since you were in 
Risk also, I thought you could give him an insightful perspective of how the 
Risk experience has helped you to move to your current role.  If you can 
swing it, I think it would be great if Mike could sit with you one day, and 
you could explain to him your job, your thoughts behind your actions, the 
data you watch, etc.  Obviously, the intent is educational, not 
interference.  So I will leave it to the two of you to work out the best 
approach and timing.

Dave - As I mentioned to you yesterday, I sang your praises also to Mike, and 
I'm glad the two of you were able to meet.  As we discussed, Mike would like 
to have some exposure to the Risk role, so it would be nice if he could sit 
with the group when the books and position are being calced.  I will leave it 
to the two of you to coordinate the day.

Mike's current role in Logistics brings him into the office at 4:00am to 
prepare the morning report.  As I understand it, his responsibilities are 
critical up until trading.  So late morning and early afternoon might be the 
best time, but you all can work through it.  When he sits with Risk, he'll 
probably go home and them return when you all start calcing.

George - Obviously Mike's first responsibilities are to Central Logistics, 
and these other opportunities are really on his own time.  We just thought it 
would be good for him to have a Risk/Trading perspective when he is trying to 
evaluate job opportunities.  I appreciate your support in this, but please 
let me know if you have any concerns.

When Mike leaves excelr, he will be going to Seattle to participate in 
MicroSoft's co-op program for the reaminder of 2000.  Obviously, he will have 
a great company to compare us to but at the end of the day, we want to ensure 
he has a great perspective on the opportunities that excelr can offer.  I 
appreciate your time to help Mike.

Warm fuzzies from Andy Rooney

I've learned....
    that the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an elderly person.
'   that when you're in love, it shows.
    that just one person saying to me, ""You've made my day!"" makes my day.
    that having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the most peaceful
feelings in     the world.

I've learned....
    that being kind is more important than being right.
    that you should never say no to a gift from a child.
    that I can always pray for someone when I don't have the strength to help
him in  some other way.

I've learned....
    that no matter how serious your life requires you to be, everyone needs a
friend  to act goofy with.
    that sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a heart to
understand.
    that simple walks with my father around the block on summer nights when I
was     a child did wonders for me as an adult.

I've learned....
    that life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets to the end,
the faster it   goes.
    that we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for.
    that money doesn't buy class.
    that it's those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular.

I've learned....
    that under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be appreciated
and     loved.
    that the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me think  I can?
    that to ignore the facts does not change the facts.
    that when you plan to get even with someone, you are only letting that
person  continue to hurt you.

I've learned....
    that love, not time, heals all wounds.
    that the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to surround myself
with    people smarter than I am.
    that everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.
    that there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and feeling
their   breath on your cheeks.

I've learned....
    that no one is perfect until you fall in love with them.
    that life is tough, but I'm tougher.
    that opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you miss.
    that when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere.

I've learned....
    that one should keep his words both soft and tender, because tomorrow he
may     have to eat them.
    that a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.
    that I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it.

I've learned....
    that when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in his
little fist, that   you're hooked for life.
    that everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness
and     growth occurs while you're climbing it.
    that it is best to give advice in only two circumstances; when it is
requested and   when it is a life-threatening situation.
    that the less time I have to work with, the more things I get done.

Good Morning!

I wanted to let each of you know that I had no problem collecting sufficient 
performance data to present you to the Corporate PRC on Wednesday.  After the 
meeting I expect the results will be released to each of your PRC 
Supervisors.  You should expect them to complete your performance evaluation 
and schedule a meeting with you to discuss it.  If they do not, it is up to 
you to make the first move and ask to schedule the meeting.

Again, I enjoyed the opportunity to meet each of you and learn a bit of what 
you do.  I look forward learning even more.

Best Regards.

Big 12: Applewhite eager to reclaim his job
By Mark Wangrin
Express-News Staff Writer

AUSTIN =01* It runs up and down the inside of Major Applewhite's left knee,=
 a=20
four-inch shiny pink speed bump of a scar.=20

If it could talk, it would tell of how the anterior cruciate ligament buckl=
ed=20
as its owner planted while trying to avoid a relentless Arkansas pass rush =
at=20
the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1.

It would tell of the reconstructive surgery by team orthopedist Dr. Carey=
=20
Windler, how the joint was whipped back into shape with hours of work and=
=20
carefully tended with ice bags and heat and extra stretching and anything=
=20
else Applewhite had read, heard or seen that would help keep his return on=
=20
pace.

If the joint could talk, it would tell people how everything's fine inside,=
=20
how Applewhite could drop back and plant, set up or scramble, in a real liv=
e=20
game today if one was scheduled.=20

If it could talk ... well, Applewhite might well be the happiest guy on the=
=20
planet.

Being a quarterback, team guy and newly inaugurated Student Government=20
representative, Applewhite tries to be diplomatic, but part of him wishes h=
e=20
wouldn't have to answer a steady barrage of questions about his knee, no=20
matter how well-meaning the fans might be.

""I don't want to be rude,"" he said last week. ""I just wish they'd stop=20
asking. I love them, appreciate them, but it's getting a little ...""

Got the picture.

OK. So here's the word: Applewhite is 100 percent =01* even ahead of schedu=
le.

Ready to take on the challenge to his starting job from sophomore quarterba=
ck=20
Chris Simms, who with only one career start has graced the cover of The=20
Sporting News football preview and had an ESPN Magazine cover shoot last we=
ek

This word on Applewhite's fitness comes not just from the junior player, bu=
t=20
from the man who's worked most closely with him, physical therapist Allen=
=20
Hardin.

Applewhite, Hardin stresses unequivocally, is ready to play now.

Hardin said Applewhite has tested 5 to 10 percent above the expected range=
=20
when he's had periodic strength and flexibility tests on the injured leg.=
=20
During rehab, Hardin ditched the pool work, concentrating instead on=20
sport-specific movements, shortly after Applewhite observed that very few=
=20
football games are played under water.

One of the most effective of the workouts involved pulling on Applewhite wi=
th=20
rubber tubing as the quarterback moved, cut and set up, strengthening his=
=20
supporting muscles and improving his balance.

""If I came in and told him to do what he did yesterday, he wasn't happy,=20
because he wanted to be challenged,"" Hardin said. ""It was a challenge to co=
me=20
up with things to challenge him.""

""The only difference I can tell about the knee is it takes longer to warm=
=20
up,"" Applewhite said. ""I'll jog for four minutes instead of two, stretch fo=
r=20
six minutes instead of five.""

After workouts, Applewhite dutifully ices his knee, though he does so based=
=20
more on conventional wisdom than necessity.

""I've always heard you can get tendinitis, so I ice it,"" he said. ""I don't=
=20
have any of the symptoms, so it feels like I'm icing it for no reason.""

In some ways, Applewhite feels he's better for the injury, not the least of=
=20
which being a renewed appreciation for the game.

""So what if I'm tired?"" he said. ""I can rest when I die.""

Resting now isn't a bad thing, either. Applewhite said missing spring drill=
s=20
was a boon for his arm.

""I was throwing so much during the spring (of 1999), summer and season that=
=20
it felt like my arm was run ragged,"" he said.

Of course, the knee questions will be answered the first time Applewhite=20
takes a hit in the fall. The other question, the one that he can't shake,=
=20
will take a little longer.

Who's the starter going to be =01* Applewhite or Simms?

""I'd be quick to drop in comments about Chris,"" Hardin said of his=20
occasional, and apparently unnecessary, mention of Simms as a motivational=
=20
ploy. ""But I think internally, he'd have worked that hard whatever.""

""It's remarkable the way he's come back,"" said sophomore cornerback Roderic=
k=20
Babers, noting that Applewhite has been occasionally overthrowing even the=
=20
speediest receivers in workouts. ""In two-a-days, it'll be a fair fight.""

Asked to size up how Applewhite and Simms have looked in informal workouts,=
=20
Babers said, ""I think (Simms) has the advantage. Major's been sitting out a=
nd=20
Simms' confidence is up, big-time. That's what you need in a quarterback. B=
ut=20
at the same time, Major's a veteran. He's beaten Nebraska. He's beaten them=
=20
all.""

""He's the same old Major,"" cornerback Quentin Jammer said.

Soon Applewhite will probably be as tired of talking about the quarterback=
=20
duel as he is about answering questions about the state of his knee. Now, a=
=20
month before the freshmen report on Aug. 13, he's talking about how he's no=
t=20
competing against Simms, just against himself.

""The competitive nature that Tiger Woods has is the competitive nature I=20
have,"" Applewhite said. ""At Pebble Beach, Tiger was up 15 and had a 10-foot=
er=20
on the last hole for birdie, and he was out there lining it up. He could ha=
ve=20
done the 'Happy Gilmore' tap to the hole and still won. But he wanted it al=
l.""

Simms has bulked up from 208 to 223 pounds, working on his leg and upper bo=
dy=20
strength.

""I feel like there's more to me now, that it's not like the wind's going to=
=20
blow me over,"" he said. ""I don't want to be a wimpy quarterback. I want to =
be=20
like Brett Favre. He's not the biggest or the fastest, but he can run when =
he=20
has to and he can chuck it 80 (yards).

""It's going to come, and it'll get worse,"" Simms said of the building=20
scrutiny. ""To tell you the truth, I don't care. Football's a competitive=20
sport. There's nothing you can do about it.""

So he shrugs it off for now, concentrating on finishing up summer school.=
=20
He's working on his topic for a writing course, ""History of American=20
Baseball."" The book he chose is about Babe Ruth.

In August, the topic switches to college football. The question remains the=
=20
same. And Chris Simms, or Major Applewhite, won't write this story.

They'll live it.

 WAKE UP AMER  A, THIS IS WHY OUR
 FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND
 AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION

Where We're Headed
    By Robert A. Waters
****************************************************************

 You're sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your
 bedroom door.

 Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled
 whispers. At least two people have broken into your house
 and are moving your way.

 With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed
 and pick up your shotgun. You rack a shell into the
 chamber, then inch toward the door and open it.

 In the darkness, you make out two shadows. One holds a
 weapon--it looks like a crowbar.

 When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the
 shotgun and fire. The blast knocks both thugs to the floor.
 One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to
 the front door and lurches outside.

 As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're
 in trouble. In your country, most guns were outlawed years
 before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently
 regulated as to make them useless.
 Yours was never registered.

 Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died.
 They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal
 Possession of a Firearm.

 When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry:
 authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter.
 ""What kind of sentence will I get?"" you ask.
 ""Only ten-to-twelve years,"" he replies, as if that's nothing.
 ""Behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven.""

 The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local
 newspaper. Somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric
 vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir
 boys. Their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say
 about them. Buried deep down in the article, authorities
 acknowledge that both ""victims"" have been arrested numerous
 times. But the next day's headline says it all:
 ""Lovable Rogue Son Didn't Deserve to Die."" The thieves have
 been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type
 pranksters.

 As the days wear on, the story takes wings. The national media
 picks it up, then the international media.

 The surviving burglar has become a folk hero. Your attorney
 says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win.

 The media publishes reports that your home has been
 burglarized several times in the past and that you've been
 critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the
 suspects. After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you
 would be prepared next time. The District Attorney uses this to
 allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.

 A few months later, you go to trial. The charges haven't been
 reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted. When
 you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works
 against you. Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean,
 vengeful man.

 It doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.

 The judge sentences you to life in prison.

__________________________________________

 This case really happened.

***********************************
 On August 22, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk, England,
 killed one burglar and wounded a second. In April, 2000, he was
 convicted and is now serving a life term.

 How did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the
 once-great British Empire?

 It started with the Pistols Act of 1903. This seemingly
 reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and
 established that handgun sales were to be made only to those
 who had a license. The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing
 to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns.
 Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of
 any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of
 all shotguns.

 Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after
 the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987. Michael Ryan, a
 mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down
 the streets shooting everyone he saw. When the smoke cleared,
 17 people were dead.

 The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of ""gun
 control"", demanded even tougher restrictions. (The seizure of all
 privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan
 used a rifle.)

 Nine years later, at Dunblane, Scotland, Thomas Hamilton used
 a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at
 a public school.

 For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as
 mentally unstable, or worse, criminals. Now the press had a real
 kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners. Day after day,
 week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and
 demanded a total ban on all handguns.
 The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the
 few sidearms still owned by private citizens.

 During the years in which the British government incrementally
 took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right
 to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism. Authorities
 refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened,
 claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to
 own a gun. Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were
 charged while the real criminals were released. Indeed, after the
 Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, ""We
 cannot have people take the law into their own hands.""

 All of Martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and
 several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young
 thugs who had no fear of the consequences. Martin himself, a
 collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or
 stolen by burglars.

 When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns
 were given three months to turn them over to local authorities.
 Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law. The few
 who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year
 prison sentences if they didn't comply.

 Police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 200,000 handguns
 from private citizens.

 How did the authorities know who had handguns?

 The guns had been registered and licensed. Kinda like cars.

 Sound familiar?

Subject: Analyst PRC Review

Eric,

Let me introduce myself.  I am currently Director of Tax for the excelr India 
business unit and have been with excelr in various Tax functions for 
approximately 5 years.  I have been asked to sit on the excelr Corp. 
Performance Review Committee as PRC Representative for a group of  18 
Analysts, including you.  Your 6/2000 performance results will be presented 
to the PRC on 19-July PRC, along with all other Analysts.  

I want to make certain we both take full advantage of the PRC process.  To 
that end, I need you to bring me up-to-speed on your pre-excelr background and 
what you have accomplished while at excelr, in particular during the 6/2000 
review period, and what you intend to accomplish this year (your ""goals"").  
With this information, I can be best prepared to speak of your achievments 
during the 19-July PRC presentation.  

Here's what I need -

resume (most recent is fine,  even if out of date)
name of your ""PRC Supervisor"" ( i.e., the person who has gathered your 6/2000 
Feedback)
location and phone extension
your goals for the 2000 year (if these were not formalized, I would 
appreciate your doing so)
accomplishments this review period (especially toward achievement of your 
stated goals)
outside activities which support the community, especially those where your 
represent ""excelr"" (e.g., charitable endeavors)
other activities you are involved in which support ""excelr"" as a whole (e.g., 
college recruiting)

One last thing, please forgive the somewhat impersonal use of email.  I would 
like to meet you in person and hope that we can arrange that early next 
week.  Would you be available Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon (11/12-July) for 
30 minutes?  We could use that time to run through your background materials.

Please furnish the name of your ""PRC Supervisor"" by email ( my list indicates 
it is Tom Martin ) so that  I can contact them for a copy of the business 
unit PRC materials that should have recently been completed for you.

Thanks for your help ... I look forward to meeting you !

Celeste,

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Looks nice.  I just had my meeting with my V.P.- looks like I will be doing 
my next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th).  I hear it is a real good 
group to work with (real smart and nice people)- but I think they put in a 
lot of overtime- especially during federal compliance and some during state 
compliance time.  Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so 
going before I rotate in August  might not be a bad idea- although I really 
think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.  Side 
thought- when in the hell am I going to study for the CPA- especially since I 
have NO motivation and I am about to enter a group that has lots of OT.  You 
do realize that I am never going to pass that exam- and I'll probably lose my 
job- and then either you or my family will just have to take care of me.  I 
am feeling a little stressed/anxious today for some reason- in case you 
didn't pick up on that.  I definately feel like I need a vacation.

It is coming up on that time again.  The most glorious time of year.  The 
time of the year when life begins anew.  No, not spring, FOOTBALL SEASON!

That being said, it is time to start thinking about fantasy football again.

I need to know who of you is interested in playing again, and any suggestions 
on rule changes (i.e. scoring, fees, etc.). I was thinking about having the 
draft in late August.

Let me know if you have any friends that you think might want to play.

Subject: FANTASY FOOTBALL 2000

It is coming up on that time again.  The most glorious time of year.  The 
time of the year when life begins anew.  No, not spring, FOOTBALL SEASON!

That being said, it is time to start thinking about fantasy football again.

I need to know who of you is interested in playing again, and any suggestions 
on rule changes (i.e. scoring, fees, etc.). I was thinking about having the 
draft in late August.

Let me know if you have any friends that you think might want to play.

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Look man, you started this shit by bringing up the same cheap EES comments 
that you always do when you have nothing better to say.  When I have to put 
up with that lack of respect from you on a daily basis, I consider it below 
the belt.  I would have liked to keep this to the game, but for some reason 
you always add the bit about EES.  Besides, don't throw Brenda choosing 
between you and Heidi in my face.  That doesn't add much credibility.

Between friends,  life and work are not constant competitions to see who's 
smarter or who makes more money.  I was genuinely happy for you when you 
decided to stay on at the desk.  As a matter of fact, I remember giving you 
advice, as a friend, on that very subject.  I hold no resentment or jealousy 
that you got it and I didn't.  I wouldn't have taken it anyway.  I neither 
liked my job in risk or felt that I was exceptional at it.  But, I did it 
well enough to bide time and move on to something that I'm more suited for.  
My move to EES wasn't a banishment, but a choice.  It was a risk that paid 
off very well.  Of course you are better at what you do than I.  But I 
seriously doubt you could be as effective as I am in front of a Customer or 
managing a project.  It's all about what you do well and being happy with 
that.  I'm glad we both are, but attempting to make me or my position less 
important because I don't work on the trading floor is just typical ENA 
arrogant bullshit.

....And you have no history about getting hammered and hooking up with skanks 
(i.e. Indian Princess.)  At least I don't take them on dates (that was 
justified.)  Now let's cut this crap and move on.

The Tigers wear the mantle of favorite well. They have won
                    nine straight games in postseason play, including the 
Southeastern
                    Conference tournament. They are relatively healthy. They 
have power
                    hitters, they have patient hitters, and they can field 
better than recent
                    versions of the club. Best of all, they have a lot of 
arms, and they have

			Mock draft No. 1: Mihm's the word
			
?			
			
			
			
			
			
?	By Andy Katz
	ESPN.com
	
	With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere 
between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential 
of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.
	
	NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking 
heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft 
camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of 
talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several 
projections we'll have on ESPN.com.
	
	A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but 
could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing 
in Chicago.
	
	The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a 
chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center 
Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason 
Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard 
Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point 
guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State 
junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey 
forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.
	
	Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next 
month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must 
decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until 
June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and 
Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what 
happens.
	
	ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock 
draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.
	
	
	
	
	Chris Mihm
	
	Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.
	
	1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and 
could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets 
could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next 
season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.
	
	2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be 
getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player 
in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer. 
Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the 
Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.
	
	3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have 
already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward 
(which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him 
defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to 
return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door 
open for a return.
	
	4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center 
for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next 
in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better 
offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.
	
	5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles 
but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic 
an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last 
season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.
	
	6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on 
Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better 
scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta 
wants a small forward over a big guard.
	
	7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can 
package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be 
solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy 
McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would 
have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.
	
	8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the 
third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too, 
but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for 
size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are 
split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.
	
	9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go 
higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce 
during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson, 
DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over 
a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.
	
	10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.): 
The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their 
three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has 
scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without 
feeling pressured to play him next season.
	
	11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past 
11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but 
can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from 
Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much 
different.
	
	12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don 
Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the 
Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a 
foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts 
and in Chicago -- if he shows.
	
	13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to 
take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough 
to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the 
point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching 
because of his leadership and toughness.
	
	14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't 
let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next 
to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go 
higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.
	
	15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power 
forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift. 
None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a 
rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the 
Pacers.
	
	16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a 
backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under 
any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind 
Cleaves. 
	
	17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed, 
he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit 
all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the 
Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement 
Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs. 
	
	18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers 
need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that 
some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of 
being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.
	
	19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up 
into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will 
catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of 
his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The 
Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.
	
	20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have 
already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off 
the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first 
round, regardless of where he's being picked.
	
	21. Toronto -- Craig ""Speedy"" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have 
already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If 
Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural 
pick for the Raptors.
	
	22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some 
heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical 
players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big. 
Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.
	
	23. Utah -- Hanno M""tt""l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with 
picking M""tt""l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end 
up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small 
forward. If M""tt""l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first 
round.
	
	24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point 
guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most 
intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard 
positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the 
Bulls some versatility on the floor.
	
	25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another 
big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor 
together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns 
have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.
	
	26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism 
and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason. 
Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could 
still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.
	
	27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave 
reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early 
without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers 
have a history of going younger in the draft.
	
	28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers 
don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to 
jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking 
skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many 
miles left in his legs.
	
	29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's 
where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or 
Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the 
Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.

Subject: Bryan Hull is moving on. Let's celebrate !!!

Yes, we have finally suckered some other excelr group into taking on Bryan 
Hull.  Just teasin', Bryan's last day with the Risk Team will be this Friday, 
June 2nd.  It wouldn't be right if we didn't send him off without his well 
deserved roasting.

This Thursday evening at 5:30 we will gather at Teala's on W. Dallas to bid 
Bryan farewell.

For future reference, Bryan will be joining the EOL group on the 26th floor 
on Monday, June 5th.  His extension will be the same so feel free to continue 
to harass him. 

See ya there! 

If, in haste, we have left anyone off our distribution please forward the 
invite on.

Thanx!
Yvette

Subject: 24 x 5 Products

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, 
May 24th. 

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas 
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in 
that the Product  description has an 
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day 
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these Products based 
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are 
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably - 
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days 
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider 
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low, 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.

Subject: Well Head Accrual Income Calculation

Eric,

We've reviewed your wellhead accrual income data for February, 2000 and 
present our input on the attachment.  Generally, we have a few minor 
questions relating to the Comstock/Sun deals (do improper prior bookings 
account for the difference between the purchase price in some cases - ie. 
$2.477 vs. 2.508?) and certain deals do not appear to be wellhead related 
(Western Gas 500752 & 507804 and Pan Energy 500560).  The dollar amount 
involved are quite minor.

I believe, on a going forward basis, the large Coastal negative number 
($92,233) will disappear beginning on 4/1/2000.  As we discussed, would you 
therefore provide us with your wellhead accrual income data for April, 2000 
so we can see the net effect of correcting the Coastal booking?  Thanks.

George x3-6992

Things to Remember:
We cannot see the future. We cannot change the past.
We can only live in the now with an eye towards
gaining enough power in the future to wreak revenge on
everyone who ever screwed us in the past.

Dreaming frees the soul, energizes the spirit and
allows you to do things that would get your ass thrown
in jail if you really tried them.

Love means never having to say, ""Does that twenty
include the spanking?

To truly love another, you must first love yourself.
And it wouldn't kill you to wash your hands in between
either.

A little bit of love goes a long way in our lives. It
can provide us with higher highs and lower lows. But,
if it comes with a persistent burning sensation, see
your physician.

When it becomes a crime to love, you should probably
consider dating outside the family.

If Life hands you lemons today, smile and give thanks.
Then when Life isn't looking, give him a quick knee to
the groin. That'll learn him.

They say a smile is a gift which is free to the giver
and precious to the recipient. But giving the finger
is free, too, and I find it more personal and sincere.

Subject: Daily Throughput Data

We have access to a pretty realistic (close to actual) physical throughput 
number going back to about February of 1998.  Anything prior to that would 
take some work to come up with.  If you are looking for a scheduled 
throughput number the best place to get that data from would be POP's/Unify.  
By totalling all of the reciept or delivery contracts and including any 
Bammel activity, you should get a pretty accurate scheduled throughput 
number.  You just have to make sure you don't double dip on gas going through 
processing plants, partnership activity, etc.

Let me know what you and Ed are looking for and we can help pull the data 
together.

Michael - can you give me an idea of where we are in uploading the Specs for 
this.

Eric, our biggest concern with this right now is the valuation for the 
Products that you would see in your Position Summary. We know that is we 
passed these trades through the system as a straight month-long transaction, 
that the valuation would be wrong. Additionally, the start and end dates will 
skue the valuation based on which day of the week the first calendar day of 
the month falls on and which day of the week the last calendar day of the 
month falls on. Using a straight 5/7 valuation methodology is only going to 
get you 'close' to true value in the Position Summary. Hence, the specs sent 
to Mike that you see in the e-mail below will need to be built.

In short, Eol was not set up to readily accept this valuation methodology. We 
will get you as close as we can, and we will give you some idea of how close 
these Position Values will be. 

Also, can you confirm that you intent to always and ONLY trade this Product 
during bid week?

Mark & Michael,
Remember we had discussed this when you were here.
The question is ......................in EOL Reports there is a Position 
Summary Report and in Stack Manager there is the Transaction Summary.
will these calculate properly on the 24x5 product? The start date & end date 
will imply every day but the product excludes weekends.

We have finsihed creating and testing a the new 24x5 Nat Gas Product (a month 
long transaction which only moves gas Mon-Fri). A final question has come up 
- how will these be calculated. Jennifer is under the impression that 
something was being built in the EOL Position Summary Report that would be 
able to calculate these kinds of trades. Is that the case? Has that been done?

Subject: Re: Wellhead Accrual Income

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =

Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =       
$100,000
Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs

Total Value =                                   $177,000

March - 

Total Accrual Value = $292,145

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid =

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you,

Since the Product Type description is ""US Gas Basis"", it is implied that the 
swap is against last day NYMEX and some othe MONTHYL CONTRACT PRICE, which is 
why we specify GD/D, so the viewer knows its a NYMEX last day vs. Gas Daily 
Average price. Take a look at the Indexes used in the other Basis swaps that 
are out there and you'll see what I mean.
I'm a little concerned about the request for Agua Dulce and Carthage. If 
memory serves me, Elsa tried to push these through earlier and it was 
determined that gas at these delivery points was interruptable. Interruptable 
gas is NOT offered on EOL. PLease check with Elsa on this.

On the new Gas Daily product that you are setting up, I think it would be a 
good idea to have a Nymex reference in the short description.  Something

Thanks to all of you for your generosity and support of the MS-150.  This 
year's event was another huge success, with over 8,000 riders participating 
in the 180 mile bike ride to Austin.  excelr once again had the largest team, 
breaking the national record with over 400 riders.  This year, the MS Society 
expects to set a new fundraising record of over $3 million.  With your 
support, excelr will again be the top fund-raising team with over $350,000 in 
pledges to date.  Rest assured that your money will be put to good use in 
Multiple Sclerosis research as we try to find a cure for this terrible 
disease.  

The conditions were absolutely perfect this past weekend.  The race started 
off at 7am Saturday morning from Tully Stadium in Houston.  Team excelr once 
again had the privilege of starting first in the race.  Things were going 
pretty well for me until mile 6, when another biker veered into my rear 
wheel.  Luckily, I managed not to fall and no one was hurt, but my wheel was 
completely bent.  I eventually found a support vehicle to take me to the 
first rest stop where they could do the repairs.  Unfortunately, it took me 
over 2 hours to get my bike fixed.  So much for the early start!

The rest of the day went smoothly, and I was able to make up most of the time 
I had lost in the morning by riding through the rest stops.  After lunch in 
Bellville, the roads had a few more hills, but the wind was cooperative all 
the way to LaGrange, the midway point of the race.  In LaGrange, excelr 
treated us to massages, a barbeque dinner, and cold beer, all much 
appreciated after 100 miles of riding.  The atmosphere in the camp is a lot 
of fun, with a band playing and riders filtering in all evening long with 
stories about the day's ride.  

The next morning, we got up bright and early at 5am for the MS Society's 
famous pancake breakfast.  We needed the carbohydrates because the second day 
features the infamous Bastrop State Park and its killer hills.  My legs were 
a little stiff the next morning, but after the first few miles I was warmed 
up and ready to go.  I cruised through most of the morning until Bastrop.  
For the record, the hills in the park aren't half as bad as people say.  It's 
actually one of my favorite parts of the ride because it's shaded by trees, 
and you get a lot of momentum going down the hills.  Once we were out of the 
park, lunch was only a few miles away.  I scarfed down some Subway sandwiches 
and brownies, refilled my Camelback, and was ready to go again.  Only 40 
miles left!  

After breezing through the first 20 miles, I started to wear down a little.  
At the same time, the wind picked up, so the last 20 miles were probably the 
toughest part.  When you're that close to the finish line, you have to suck 
it up and keep going.  They post mile markers the last 4 miles, and you can 
feel the anticipation building.  The last mile of the race is packed with 
people on each side cheering you on.  It's quite a rush when you get to the 
end.  Upon arriving in Austin, I checked my bike on the truck back to Houston 
and enjoyed Hooter's chicken sandwiches and pasta salad.  What a ride!

Thanks again for your support.  Just to let you know, I'll be coming around 
next week to collect your pledge.  Your contribution is, of course, fully tax 
deductible.  excelr is also doubling all pledges (the Cycling Club is taking 
care of the paperwork, so no need to fill out a form).  


Hope to see you in the race next year!

Brian

Subject: Re: Wellhead Accrual Income

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =

=       $13,000

Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =

Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs

Total Value =                                   $177,000

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you,

When you call up the production save the file as a txt file then open it in 
excel as a delimited file.
If you need any help please feel free to give me a call or email me your

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =       
$105,000
Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =       
$100,000
Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $65,000           $113,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($95,000)
Total Value =                                   $177,000

March - 

Total Accrual Value = $292,145

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid =       
$106,000
Accrual Value =                               $59,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $66,000           $119,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($100,000)
Total Value =                                   $172,000

Good afternoon sons. How  is the world treating you? Hope all is well. I
need information from each of you. The Bass family reunion is Friday night
and Saturday, in Fairfield, on May 5th and 6TH. Barbara and Neil Bass are
the hosts. They need a head count of those attending, ASAP. Before I let him
know, I need to know if  either of you will be joining me and your Mother.
Hope you will, but will understand if you do not. Let me know as soon as you
can. Love U-Dad

60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly 
basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.

For example:

Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.

This means that:

Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000
Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000

Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000)
So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense
Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)

Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value
Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been 
previously recognized.
Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.

I wanted to take a minute to apologize to you guys for the scene at last 
night's game.  I did not do a captain's job of controlling the situation, and 
I am sorry.  That being said, I am writing to determine if we will have a 
team in the next session.  We had previously committed to play, but with 
recent developments, I am not sure if everyone is still interested.  Please 
let me know if you will be interested in playing in the next session because 
I have already told the sportsplex that we will be playing.  If we decide not 
to play, I need to let them know ASAP and try and get the money back(forfeit 
deposit).  It is critical that I get a 100% response to this email to gauge 
whether or not we have enough people.  Due to the increased number of the 
people on the team working in risk, we will need as many bodies as possible 
due to the early games this session(they start this time at 6:30).  The 
season begins next wednesday.

Thanks again for a fun and memorable season and I hope we do it again(at 
least the fun part).  Have a good weekend.

Subject: FYI -New Product on EOL

Just so everyone is on the same page:

Based on Jennifer and Dale's discussions with Eric Bass, a new ""tokenized 
period"" will be set up in EOL.  The intent of this period (quick overview) is 
to allow for gas flow Monday through Friday and no flow on the weekends.  
This will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month 
increments.

It is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to 
the customer and priced accordingly using EOL, the trade itself (with 
Multiple Monday - Friday, no flow during weekend periods) cannot be handled 
internally by EOL.  Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara 
bridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.  Because of this, there should be 
heighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.  These 
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually.

An effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications (EOL and 
Sitara) on how a deal with multi-periods can flow without human 
intervention.  This has not been started.  In the meantime, a deal of this 
nature will have to be entered manually.

How do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?  Once the EOL 
product has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.  
The person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what 
is meant by the EOL product's delivery period and enter the deal 
accordingly.  

For example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:

  Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara 
ticket
  
  Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07
   04/10  04/14
   04/17  04/21
   04/24  04/28 
  
 Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing

 Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade.

 Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open 
ended.  Every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date 
is on the path; otherwise
 the number of reconciling items will increase.

Please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted.

Any concerns, please contact Sheri Thomas or myself.

Eric -

Logistics is telling us that this product is not presently traded OTC. The 
Sitara group is telling us that we don't presently have the ability to 
support this product, which is probaby a result of the fact that is is 
unprecedented. 
To my knowledge EOL doesn't have the ability to eliminate specific dates 
between the Start Date and End Date.

David, essentially this product would be a calendar month long US Phys Gas 
contract where we DO NOT move gas on the weekends. 

Can we chat about this please.

Hey!  Did we ever come up with our plans for the week/weekend?  I know that 
you said you were busy Wednesday and Thursday night- so I figured you and I 
would do something Friday night.  Michelle (one of the girls that I work 
with) asked if I wanted to go with her to a crawfish boil Saturday late 
afternoon- but I got the idea that it wasn't a bring a date type thing.  I 
haven't eaten crawfish in an age- so sounded like fun- I know that we don't 
usually so stuff during the day on the weekends- but I wanted to make sure 
that you didn't have anything planned for us to do that afternoon before I 
told her one way or the other.  But- even if I went to the boil- I would be 
back in time to go out later that night.  

Just let me know what you think.  Oh- and I guess since you can't see me 
Wednesday or Thursday- that probably means that you want to see me tonight.

My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in 
with logistics. We need to check with the Sitara Group to see if this is 
feasible. In the OTC world it's a lay-up because you can enter the different 
legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL 
is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates.

Scott Mills is out on vacation until Monday and he's the man I have to see. I 
will follow up with him next week.

 In all honesty- if you don't want to go- I probably won't go either.  I am 
not a huge professional baseball fan- it is so slow!-  so to go to something 
like that I really need to enjoy the people that I am with.  Don't think that 
the tax department necessarily falls into that category- but would be 
bareable if you were there. Just a side thought- but my dad would be so mad 
if he knew I had the opportunity to go- but didn't.  Don't know why that just 
popped in my head.  I guess I write e-mails using ""stream of consciousness"" 
also.

Also- you know- you and Jennifer are a lot alike.  You know how you send me 
ugly e-mails when you are the last person on any group e-mail that I send 
out.  Well- she is even worse- she just called and yelled at me- b/c she was 
not the FIRST person on a group e-mail that I sent.

Happy St. Patrick's Day!
I'm moving this weekend to another apartment in the same complex.  We're
overlooking the pool now, so stop by and visit.  I've attached the new
address.  Phone numbers will remain the same.

Things here in Houston are going well.  I'm going to Eastern Europe March
29-April 11.  The tentative schedule is Budapest, Prague, Munich, Salzberg,
Vienna, and Marseille.  The weekend after I get back is the MS-150 bike ride

from Houston to Austin, so wish me luck!


Hope all's well,
Brian

My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in 
with logistics. We need to check with the Sitara Group to see if this is 
feasible. In the OTC world it's a lay-up because you can enter the different 
legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL 
is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates.

Scott Mills is out on vacation until Monday and he's the man I have to see. I 
will follow up with him next week.

Subject: Market Meters Breakout

Brenda,

I am going through the market meters right now and am finding the following 
results for February.

TOM $124,002
GREG      $9,285

I started the process by pulling all the meters and associated transport 
rates off the transport capacity tickets.  I pulled them based on the 
delivery rates being greater than the matrix.  I then researched the deals to 
pull the deal tickets.  If the deal occurred before 7/99, then I assigned the 
expense to Tom.  If the deal occurred after 7/99, then I looked at who the 
dealmaker was and based the assignment of the transport expense on who the 
dealmaker was.  In all cases, either Papayoti or Lamphier did the deal.

I also trued up the transport rate to the transport rate on the deal ticket.  
This includes occasions when the transport capacity ticket did not have a 
transport rate but the transport capacity ticket had an increased rate.  In 
other words, I defaulted to the deal ticket so that we could have a paper 
record of the transport rate.

As of now, I still have to pull January volume and attach the rate to the 
March transport.  I wanted to go through the full analysis first and now that 
I have the actual transport rate from the deal ticket, I know which rate to 
attach.

I will pursue these avenues next.  Please let me know what questions you have.


Heidi

Subject: Additional Transport Expense on Entex meters

Eric, I am checking the process now for incorporating all transport revenue 
due Ed for delivery meters in the Texas region.  The following meters have 
transport rates attached to them which are above and beyond the matrix rates 
Ed quotes to Tom.  I believe that we are already capturing all Ed's 
revenue/Tom's expense for this gas at these meters, but want to be sure of 
that.   Would you let me know if these are the meters for which we are 
manually moving around money from Tom to Ed for the residential portion of 
the Lufkin-Diboll volume?



I believe that the industrial portion of this volume is included already as 
part of Ducote's deal, and I believe that the residential portion is volume 
which you determine and then move from Tom to Ed every month.

Is this right?

Hey!  It's going to be a good day- I can already tell.  I just had one of the

better day at work then the past couple- I feel confident that you will- that

Ok- I'm getting pissed off.  I came in today to work on a project- only to 
find out that my tax application is not set up to do what I need to do.  So- 
basically i can't even start on this until someone from out support team can 
come look at it- and you just don't understand- with our support team- that 
could take a day or two.  See that is the problem here- in EVERY person that 
I have worked with at excelr- NO ONE ever thinks ahead.  No one is a planner.  
Like- I am new in this group- why did no one consider the fact that I 
wouldn't have this on my desktop- and that it would take a while to get it- 
especially on a Friday- when half our staff is gone- b/c it is  THEIR Friday 
off!  

I'm leaving at noon- and I'm not coming back- I don't care if the application 
is fixed or not.  The other lady in our group- that today is her Friday off- 
she isn't coming in.  See I am getting tired of the fact- that they treat 
their rotators like interms around here.  That is basically what is pissing 
me off.  You get all the shit work- that no one else wants to do.  You are 
totally left out of the loop- like why wasn't I told b/4 6 o'clock last 
night- that this needed to be done.  No respect and poor planning.  Very 
dangerous combination.  And I'm tired of it .  It is quickly approaching the 
time to find a new profession.

better mood when I see you tonight

Subject: Friday State of the Union

Its been a crazy February!  So many things and PEOPLE to talk about and only 
one Friday State of the Union to cover it all.  Everyone just relax because 
its going to be a long one.  As Always, Brace Yourself.

Where to begin?  How about those Tigers?  They are on track to be the SEC 
West Basketball Champions.  Who would have thought it? Kristin, my younger 
sister who is a freshman, says LSU is like ""Spring Break Everyday!""  That's 
great!  I'm sure the students at Harvard say the same thing when their teams 
are on a winning streak.  Geaux Tigers!

Forget Engagements how about Shot-Gun Weddings!  I recently learned that, 
while making a weekend trip to New Orleans, my high school sweet heart, 
Sarah, got ""Tanked"" in the French Quarter and found herself in the middle of 
the Pat O Brian's  Piano Bar in front of a minister saying ""I DO"" to her 
boyfriend, now husband, Brandt.  On such short notice, they were unable to 
find a reception hall to celebrate the wedding, so the family just celebrated 
all night at Dante's Pizza.  I hear it was one hell of a party.  
Congratulations Sarah!

Speaking of good parties, the DC Mardi Gras Balls were incredible.  I'd like 
to take this time to once again thank my buddy, Chris, for taking me and 
Kenny K with him.  If you enjoy Politics like I do, its a must see event.  
The two things that stick mostly in my mind are:  The last night of the ball 
after several cocktails, Granola Centola staggering over to Senator Mary 
Landrieu and saying,""Mrs. Clinton, will you dance with me to New Orleans 
Lady?""  That Larry, he's paving the path for his political future------a 
regular James Carville!  I also had the opportunity to ask the ever-so-shy 
Edwin Edwards a question - ""Governor who do you like in the President's 
Race?""  He responded, ""Have the odds come out already?!?""  No doubt a man of 
true character.

I hear times are tough for my friends down in Shreveport.  Brandon, a full 
time med school student, has been moonlighting during his free time.  He 
decided to put his ""Three on the top, two on the sides, don't touch the back, 
Jack, haircut "" to work on the Internet.  He's currently modelling his sweet 
hair style as ""Mullet of the Week""  at http://www.mulletsgalore.com/ .  He 
gets 50 cents every time the site is hit, so take the time and visit the site 
to help an aspiring doctor.

February was a good month and things are pretty good at the homefront.  I 
still haven't found the girl of my dreams, but neither has my roommate, 
Matt.  Although the chances of him finding one before me are pretty good 
considering all he's looking for is, and I quote, ""A girl who is pretty and 
who thinks I am smart just because I read the newspaper.""   
ICE---ICE---BABY---TOO COLD---TOO COLD!

Everyone have a great weekend!

CKL

Subject: Re: Friday State of the Union  

hey everyone it is you lucky day!  i forgot to put a few things into my 
famous friday state of the union.  first, i have picked up cooking recently.  
i am a regular emeril.  for my roommate matt's b-day i decided to make him an 
ice cream cake.  it looked so delicious.  i used cookie dough ice cream with 
an oreo cookies crust and whip cream.  for flavor i added two sticks of 
butter (the recipe calls for zero).  it looked so good that i ate it all 
before matt got home.  lucky for me matt came home in time to give me the 
hymlec's because i was choking to death on a stick of butter.  i am 
dissapointed though because i spilled ice cream all over my shirt and matt's 
carpet.  if anyone needs the recipe please call.

i did have a date this week with some girl (we will call her X).  we went to 
dinner and had appetizers, main course, desert and wine.  well, i had wine.  
we then went to my favorite bar.  i got a little buzzed so i let her drive my 
car.  X got made because i took a nap on the way home and she had to potato 
sack me into the house.  why do they call it ""landry loaded""?

i have been working out lately.  my friends still like to call me dough boy.  
i think they are jealous that i am so carved up.  god i am tan!

keep in touch

ckl 

ps-  please foward to our friends not on the distribution who would love to 
read my state of the union

If u have a chance sometime in the near future could u do an hr session of

Eric,

Could you find some time to look at the new Southern Union contract for 
Galveston and Port Arthur?  Pricings are wrong in Sitara so my system 
invoices are being understated/overstated each month.

If you want, we could sit down and go over it to see what needs to be done.  

Let me know.

Thanks.

Subject: CP&L Requests - Jan '00

Eric;

Two requests for the current Central Power & Light contract 96022030 - Sitara 
Deal 92399:

1.  For January 2000 volumes, we need a deficiency charge added in the amount 
of 12,231.85.

2.  For the entire length / term of this deal, the second step of the tiers 
or NNQ should have the rate handle associated with Gas Daily Houston Ship 
Channel HIGH for the day delivered less one cent.   This is per the 
confirmation Contract Price item 2.  The dollar impact for the incorrect use 
of the MID rate for Jan '00 is 6,395.23.  This same change in the rate handle 
should be made retroactively to November '99 and proactively through October 
'00.

Total dollar impact for January '00 = 18,627.08  added revenue.

Attached is the Jan worksheet.  Questions or comments, please let me know.

LETTER FROM COLLEGE

An exact replica of a letter a daughter wrote to her parents
from college

Dear Mom and Dad:

It has now been three months since I left for college. I
have been remiss in writing this and I am very sorry for my
thoughtlessness in not having written before. I
will bring you up to date now, but, before you read on,
please sit down.

YOU ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SITTING DOWN.

OKAY! Well, then, I am getting along pretty well now. The
skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of
the window of my dormitory when it caught
fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I
only get those sick headaches once a day.

Fortunately the fire in the dormitory and my jump were
witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm,
and he was the one who called the fire department
and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and,
since I had nowhere to live because of the burned out
dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share
his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but
it's kind of cute.

He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and
are planning to be married. We haven't set the exact date
yet, but it will be before my pregnancy
begins to show.

Yes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are
looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will
welcome the baby and give it the love,
devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.

The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my
boyfriend has some minor infection, which prevents us from
passing our pre-marital blood tests, and I
carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with
the penicillin injections I am having daily. I know you will
welcome him into our family with open arms. He is kind and,
although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is
of a different race and religion than ours, I know your
often-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered
by the fact that his skin color is somewhat different from
ours. I am sure you will love him as I do.

His family background is good too, for I am told that his
father is an important gun-bearer in the village from which
he came.

Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you
that there was no dormitory fire, I did not have a
concussion or a skull fracture. I was not in the hospital, I
am not pregnant, I am not engaged. I do not have syphilis
and there is no man in my life.

However, I am getting a 'D' in History and an 'F' in Science
and I wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.

Yours,

Your Loving Daughter.

THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

  CLASSIC  VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house
  and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks  the ant is a
  fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant
  is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out
  in the cold.


  MODERN VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering  heat all summer long, building his
  house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks
  he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter,
  the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why
  the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while  others are cold and
  starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of  the shivering
  grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home  with a table
  filled with food.

  ""America"" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a
  country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?

  Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah  with the grasshopper, and everybody cries
  when they sing ""It's Not Easy Being  Green.""

  Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening
  News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they
  can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by
  those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to
  it as ""Temperatures of the 80's""

  Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in  front of the ant's house where the
  news stations film the group singing ""We shall overcome."" Jesse then has the
  group kneel down to pray to God for  the grasshopper's sake.

  Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten
  rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls  for an immediate tax hike
  on the ant to make him pay his ""fair share.""

  Finally, the EEOC drafts the ""Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act,""

  retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is  fined for failing to
  hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having  nothing left to
  pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by  the government.

  Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation
  suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a  panel of federal
  judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients
  who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM when
  there are no talk shows scheduled.

  The ant loses the case. The story  ends as we see the grasshopper finishing
  up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is
  in,which just happens to be the ant's old  house, crumbles around him since
  he doesn't maintain it.

  The ant has  disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper
  bought by selling  most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton
  standing before a wildly  applauding group of Democrats announcing that a
  new era of ""fairness"" has dawned  in America.

  The grasshopper is found dead in a drug-related incident and  the house, now
  abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the  once
  peaceful neighborhood.

Sister Margaret died and through some error found herself in hell. She
  immediately called Saint Peter and said, ""This is Sister Margaret. There's
  been a terrible mistake!""


  She explained the situation and Saint Peter said he'd get right on it. The
next day the nun didn't hear from Saint Peter and called him back.
  ""Please set this error straight before tomorrow,"" she begged. ""There's an
orgy planned for tonight, and everyone must attend!""


  ""Of course, Sister, ""he said. ""I'll get you out of there right away.""
  Apparently, her plight slipped his mind, and the following morning he
  received another phone call from hell. He picked up the receiver and
  heard, ""Hey, Pete, this is Maggie. Never mind!""

Lessons of the Geese


This Fall, when you see geese heading south for the winter flying along in 
""V"" formation, you might consider what science has discovered as to why they 
fly that way.


FACT: As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an ""uplift"" for the bird 
immediately following. By flying in a ""V"" formation, the whole flock has at 
least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flew on it's own.
LESSON: People who share a common direction and sense of community can get 
where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on 
the thrust of one another.


FACT: When a goose flies out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and 
resistance of trying to go it alone. It quickly gets back into formation to 
take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front of it.
LESSON: If we have as much common sense as a goose, we stay in formation with 
those headed where we want to go. We are willing to accept their help and 
give our help to others. It is harder to do something alone than together.


FACT: When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation, and 
another goose flies to the point position.
LESSON: It is sensible to take turns doing the hard and demanding tasks and 
sharing leadership. As with geese, people are interdependent of each others 
skills, capabilities, and unique arrangements of gifts, talents, or resources.


FACT: The geese flying in formation honk from behind to encourage those up 
front to keep up their speed.
LESSON: We need to make sure our honking is encouraging. In groups where 
there is encouragement, the production is much greater. The power of 
encouragement (to stand by one's heart or core values and encourage the heart 
and core of others) is the quality of honking we seek. We need to make sure 
our honking is encouraging and not discouraging.


FACT: When a goose gets sick, wounded, or shot down, two other geese will 
drop out of formation with that goose and follow it down to lend help and 
protection. They stay with the fallen goose until it dies or is able to fly 
again. Then, they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch 
up with their flock.
LESSON: If we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by our colleagues and 
each other in difficult times as well as in good!

Dog bites threaten home insurance
Homeowner coverage may be cancelled if your pooch is considered too aggressive


Charles V. Tines / The Detroit News

MetLife no longer writes coverage for people who own a pit bull or four other 
dogs with attitudes.

By Charlie Cain / News Lansing Bureau Chief

    A sizable increase in the number -- and severity -- of dog bites in Metro 
Detroit is increasingly forcing insurance companies to cancel homeowner 
policies at homes where the family pooch has displayed a bad attitude.
    At least one national insurance company, MetLife Auto & Home, no longer 
writes homeowner coverage for people who own any of five different breeds of 
large, often aggressive, dogs: pit bulls, rottweilers, chow chows, German 
shepherds and bull terriers.
    ""Our overall position is that if you have one of those breeds in your 
household, we will not insure you because we don't believe there's a way to 
match the risk with the rate,"" said Richard Bernstein, a MetLife 
vice-president.
    ""Dog bites tend to be difficult cases, emotionally traumatic and costly.""
    The Insurance Information Institute in New York said insurers now 
shoulder a quarter of the record $1 billion cost associated with dog bites -- 
from medical treatment to ""pain and suffering"" damage awards.
    A third of all homeowner claims result from dog bites; about 70 percent 
of insurance carriers won't renew coverage to a policyholder whose dog has 
bitten someone.
    ""We're seeing a surge of dog bite claims with pit bulls and rottweilers,"" 
said Mike Erwin, a spokesman for the institute, which represents about 350 
companies nationwide.
    ""Those are not just a nip, but a tearing of the skin that requires a lot 
more medical treatment and as a result, the costs go up.""
    Dogs were particularly aggressive in Detroit last year; the city reported 
1,574 dog bites -- up 38 percent from 1996.
    Macomb County reported 1,020 dog bites last year, up 9.5 percent from a 
year earlier.
    The Oakland County Animal Shelter, which covers much of the county, said 
the number of bites there remained constant at about 800.
    Nationally, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 4.7 
million dog bites were reported in 1997.
    Justin Harbert, a 4-year-old Warren boy, joined the growing list of 
victims last week when a neighbor's chow chow lunged at his throat. It took 
12 stitches to close the boy's wound in Bi-County Hospital.
    ""It didn't really dawn on me that there might be a problem,"" said his 
father, Gary Harbert, who was taking his son to breakfast and stopped briefly 
at the neighbor's house.
    ""I saw my son go to pet the dog and the dog jumped across the table and 
went for his throat.""
    The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that nearly 
half of all children will be bitten by age 12.
    Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the Michigan Association of Insurance, 
said the larger dogs that people are buying now to protect their homes are a 
particular concern. Too often, the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy 
mills, he said.
    ""More people will be bitten by poodles and cocker spaniels than pit bulls 
this year simply because there are so many more of them,"" he said.
    ""But the serious injuries are caused by dogs like the pit bull. The 
increase in lawsuits is the result of the attacks by these large, aggressive 
animals.
    ""People want them for protection, but the problem is these dogs often 
don't know the difference between a burglar and the kid next door or the 
mailman. Those are the people who are being bit and those are the people that 
are suing.""
    Last year, 2,795 postal carriers were bitten and the U.S. Postal Service 
now is routinely suing dog owners. 
    Farmington Hills attorney Sam Bernstein said his office handles ""quite a 
few"" dog bite claims and he has seen ""a lot of gruesome attacks, particularly 
by dogs whose owners allow them to roam the neighborhood.""
    He said Michigan is like 30 other states with strict liability laws that 
say if your dogs bites someone, you're responsible.
    ""There seems to be much more serious injuries today among people who are 
bitten by dogs,"" Bernstein said.
    State Farm Insurance, Michigan's largest provider of homeowner insurance, 
said it had 441 dog bites claims last year, up nearly 41 percent from 1996.
    ""For the last two years, Michigan has been the fifth-highest state in the 
amount paid out in dog claims by State Farm,"" said John Carroll, a company 
spokesman.
    The insurer's Michigan costs last year were $81,367 in medical claims and 
another $3.27 million to settle liability claims.
    ""We don't deny coverage based on breed since any breed can be trained to 
bite,"" Carroll said. ""But after one bite, we insist the homeowner resolve the 
situation.
    ""The policy will be discontinued if they continue to keep the dog on 
premises.""
    Dan Hattaway, a dog bite expert at State Farm's national headquarters in 
Bloomington, Ill., said the company had 14,000 dog bite claims last year -- 
up 27 percent from 1996.
    ""We had been running at about a 3 p________________________________

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed excelr Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  excelr's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are

Also,  I have been meaning to talk to you.  We agreed to terms on the TV,
but I wanted to ask something Aaron's rents gave me a 4 day Window to pay
between the 18th and 22nd and as you know at this moment in time I am living
paycheck to paycheck.  I am going to have a much higher paying job within
the next month but for now I am asking that you too can give me that Window.
For instance, my next check comes on the 20th and If I am due on the 18th ,
I will be late.

otherwise, I think it will be difficult for Chris Simms to redshirt next=20

next year. He won the job because of an injury to Major Applewhite, just as=
=20
Major won the job because of an injury to Richard Walton. If Simms starts t=

lose the job and would probably go into the spring and fall as the starter.=

If Texas flounders under Simms in the bowl game and Applewhite needs to com=

it out in the spring and fall to see who is the starter. Texas coaches have=

a validation of Simms' abilities AND an indictment  of the quarterback=20

offensive down in the game to that point and knew the tendencies of the=20

any kind of QB rotation  scheme. But, on the other hand, how can one NOT wa=

=09
=09 BROWN:  The only argument I could make in favor of the quarterback rota=

next year is that Simms should have more confidence and thus should flouris=

indirectly indicated that he hated the rotation and that his confidence=20

in the season that you picked Texas Tech for the upset over the Longhorns,=

which seemed to be an indictment on Mack Brown's ability to fire up the tea=
m,=20
assuming that Texas has more talented players. I think that he has proven=

that he can win big games, but he has also had some surprising slipups. Bro=

is unquestionably a great recruiter, but do you question his leadership=20
ability on gameday? =20
=09 ?? Andrew Wootton=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Up until the Texas Tech game, Mack Brown was saying things like=
 ""We=20
could lose any game we play. I just don't know which team is going to show=
=20
up. We could go 6-5 or 9-2."" Those kinds of=20
=09
=09comments factored into my thinking when picking Texas Tech to beat the=
=20
Longhorns. Brown is as adept at public relations and communication as any=
=20
coach I've been around. So when he was saying things like that, it made you=
=20
wonder if this team was ever going to develop an identity. Clearly, this ye=
ar=20
was a tough year in terms of leadership on the field on offense. The defens=
e=20
was fine with Casey Hampton leading the charge. But the offense really=20
struggled to find an identity. Part of that was the quarterback rotation.=

Part of it was having young receivers, and part of it was having a bunch of=
=20
guys with low-key personalities (i.e. Hodges Mitchell, Leonard Davis, Antwa=
n=20
Kirk-Hughes, Derrick Dockery, Mike Williams etc.). Mack Brown even said it=
=20
was the quietest bunch of offensive players he'd been around. Once Mack Bro=

anything else.=20

t=20
coach. I think this year was a test of his finding and developing leadershi=

on the field. The more he rotated the QBs, the less chance the offense had =
to=20
develop an identity because the young receivers were clearly struggling wit=

learning their responsibilities in four-wide as well as trying to adjust to=

than it did. Mack Brown has already gone back and said that he wished he=20
played Simms more in the Stanford game - an outing in which Applewhite real=
ly=20
struggled until the fourth quarter. Against Oklahoma, the Sooners executed=
=20
flawlessly early and Texas got hit with a punch it couldn't get up from. It=

Instead, Brown became upset with the negative voices and let it taint=20

=09
=09Brown got tough questions during his radio call-in show this season. Som=
e=20
weeks he hid his contempt for them better than others. But a guy like Brown=

of his back, use that self-deprecating laugh of his and then take his=20
frustration out in the meeting and film rooms while finding ways to turn hi=

gripe about the cold weather that everyone said would do in the Sooners in=

Kansas City. He has a tough attitude, and his team has adopted his attitude=
.=20
Brown has a tough attitude, too. And against Oregon in the Holiday Bowl and=
=20
all of next season will be the truest test of Brown's coaching and dealing=
=20
with expectations. Brown said, fairly and accurately, that Texas couldn't b=
e=20
expected to win the national title this year because the Longhorns hadn't=
=20
finished a season in the top 10 since 1983. ""How do you jump to No. 1 witho=
ut=20
having first been in the top 10?"" Brown said before the season. Does this=
=20
kind of talk trickle into the ears of players? I don't know. Most of the=20
Longhorns before the season (Applewhite and Hampton included) felt like Tex=
as=20
could win the national title. That's one of the biggest reasons Hampton cam=
e=20
back to Texas this season. When UT lost to Stanford, Brown emerged from an=
=20
emotionally blasted locker room and said, ""I didn't think this was a nation=

next season.=20
=09
=09On defense, the big question mark will be at defensive tackle because Ca=

Hampton and Shaun Rogers will be moving on. But Marcus Tubbs, Adam Doiron a=

Stevie Lee provide an ample foundation to rebuild at the position. Cory=20
Redding and Kalen Thornton should only get better, and there is a wealth of=

talent in the seven guys behind them. On offense, the big question mark is =
at=20
running back, where Hodges Mitchell is moving on. He's a guy some Texas fan=

still think is worthless. But let me tell you, he isn't. He's got guts and=

will pick up Bo Scaife at tight end.=20
=09

Brown doesn't let the nitpickers bog him down. And I include myself in that=

negative angles in a newspaper story. Here's to hoping that he'll take on=

critical questions with the ease and charm he shows publicly on a daily=20

September 6, 2000 WSJ

Bush vs. the Press
A Washington adage holds that a politician commits a ""gaffe"" when he
inadvertently tells the truth. This is how we read George W. Bush's
off-the-record aside that New York Times reporter Adam Clymer is a ""major
league"" you-know-what.

In that refreshingly incautious remark caught Monday by an open microphone,
Mr. Bush was admitting, albeit unintentionally, that his campaign has a
press problem. We aren't referring only to Mr. Clymer, whose performance
review has been ably undertaken by neo-liberal journalist Mickey Kaus at
kausfiles.com. We're talking about the general media double standard faced
by every prominent conservative politician.

As Democrat-turned-journalist Michael Barone has observed, the mainstream
media aren't pro-Democratic. They will sometimes take a Democrat to task,
especially if he violates a media shibboleth such as ""campaign-finance
reform."" But they are reliably anti-Republican. That is, in newsrooms across
the land there is noticeably greater skepticism, and often animosity, toward
politicians who are cultural conservatives or who want to restrict the scope
of federal power.

This rarely manifests itself in blatant partisanship or attacks. Instead the
slant shines through in the press pack's definition of what constitutes news
or the interpretation the pack puts on news. Consider the treatment of three
recent campaign episodes:

When Mr. Bush said back in the primaries that his favorite philosopher was
""Christ,"" he was downgraded on the spot by the press for pandering to the
""religious right."" The implication was that he couldn't possibly mean it.
But now Democrat and liberal Joe Lieberman is making a much more frequent
and vocal issue of his own religious faith, and the same media that scolded
Mr. Bush are writing long, thoughtful treatises on the role of religion in
politics. And any criticism of Mr. Lieberman is accompanied with the caveat
that the Orthodox Jew really is sincere. This is a double standard.

Or take Mr. Bush's recent decision to run a TV spot attacking Mr. Gore's
credibility. This was reported, in the New York Times and elsewhere, as
going ""negative,"" primarily as a response to Mr. Gore's rise in the polls.
But what about the weeks-long TV-ad hammering that Democrats have laid on
Mr. Bush -- for his Texas record, and even during the GOP convention on his
running mate's 15-year-old voting record? The Gore attacks were reported as
legitimate subjects of political debate. We happen to think all of these are
legitimate, but only Mr. Bush's got the good-housekeeping media's ""negative""
label.

Then there is the debate over Presidential debates. This back and forth is a
hardy perennial, and you'd think the press would merely let both sides duke
it out. But in the coverage we've seen, Mr. Bush's proposal to break from
the Commission on Presidential Debates mold is being treated as an attempt
to dodge debates or attract a smaller audience. Mr. Gore's decision to
renege on his pledges to debate on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and CNN's ""Larry
King Live"" don't get the same spin.

This criticism of Mr. Bush is especially galling when it comes from the
likes of ABC and CBS, who now whine that they won't carry debates held by
other networks. So much for their public-spiritedness. Their reaction shows
that the debate commission is less about designing a forum to educate voters
and more about dividing the commercial TV spoils equally. We hope Mr. Bush
sticks with his desire to have a less scripted, more open exchange with Mr.
Gore.

Mr. Bush has given signs before that he understands his party's media
problem better than most other Republicans. Indeed, we've long suspected
that his ""compassionate conservative"" theme was as much about media
management as policy. It was designed to deflect the inevitable media
portrayal of any Republican as a heartless, Gingrichian budget cutter. Mr.
Bush also stood up to the press pack when it sought to hound him about
rumors of youthful drug use.

We aren't suggesting that Mr. Bush should get into a pitched battle with the
press corps, and especially not with any one reporter. Our point is that Mr.
Bush won't be able to count on even-handed media coverage to carry his
battle to Mr. Gore. He's going to have to make his case directly, and not
too subtly, to voters over the heads of the media.

That means Mr. Bush would be better off doing more debates in several
forums. And, above all, it means setting his own agenda and strategy, no
matter if ankle-biters in the press corps call it ""negative.""

I got a Bed and Breakfast for Friday Night with one King Size Bed.  It will 
be nice and cozy for the six of us.

Just kidding - this is a pretty nice place - we have 2 dbls and the hotel is 
in between the stadium and 6th street.  (11th street).

the rate is $145.  the tickets are $30 - so - $54/person for everything.

we will leave at 4 on Friday if that is ok with everyone.

Passing along an email from my friend Michael Germain. :   ""It is being
reported in Dallas by 1310 The Ticket Radio, that Chris Warren
has been released by the Cowboys today. A press conference is scheduled for
this afternoon with Dave Campo. Just an FYI.""

Thanks Michael and also thanks to our buddy Daniel Dunsworth for the info.
I doubt you had Warren starting on your playoff bound FF team but this says
a lot about their faith in Emmitt Smith.  Michael Wiley likely backs up
Smith now but for them to cut Warren loose with Smith just a few games
removed from a concussion is a pretty strong statement.  Smith proved once
again last week he's a gamer I'd think removing the threat of Warren
stealing a few carries has to slightly increase his value.

Have a nice evening.

Joe

Again this week our own Cheatsheets.net Meteorologist, Mike McVay from
WOWK - TV offers his expert insights on the weather conditions that may
affect your players this week.  It's early but here are some potential
situations to keep an eye on.

WASHINGTON @ PITTSBURGH:  Saturday will bring a chance of snow to
Pittsburgh.  Both teams will likely run the ball any way, but the weather
could reinforce the ground game in this one.

NEW ENGLAND @ BUFFALO:  A chance for snow showers in Buffalo this weekend.
No surprise here.  Both teams adapt to these conditions so I don't expect
any changes in offensive schemes, but Vinatieri and Christie might not be
great options in this one.

DETROIT @ NEW YORK JETS:  Rain changing to snow in New York Sunday.  Looks
kind of messy but this is a must win for both teams.  Should be a fun game
to watch, but frustrating if you have fantasy players on either team.

TENNESSEE @ CLEVELAND:  Much like Buffalo, you can generally expect snow in
Cleveland this time of the year....and the Browns last game of 2000 will be
no exception.  Wind could be a factor in this game if you have either Del
Greco or Kevin Johnson (he's not used to passing in these kind of
conditions).

Mike McVay
StormTracker13
Meteorologist
WOWK-TV


One other note to think about is the terrible condition of Paul Brown Field
in Cincinnati where the Bengals host Jacksonville this week.  Thanks to my
friend John Pflum for the insights as he tells me the transplanted grass has
basically died and between the hashmarks is a total mess.  Could especially
be a factor for the kickers.  Just a thought.

See you Thursday morning with our cheatsheet rankings and Friday morning
with the Matchups to Avoid and Exploit.

Dear Jason,
?
I know it has been two months since my  surgery.? I don't know why the 
feelings have finally surfaced.? I did  not even say anything to your father 
until today.? 
?
First of all, I expected to see 3 smiling faces  when I awoke in the recovery 
room.? I only saw one.? I was  devastated.? I will get over it but it has to 
run its course.? Nothing  would have prevented me from being by either one of 
your sides under similar  circumstances.? I know you have lives, work, etc., 
but you, especially,  always find time for friends in need, i.e, Donnita's 
mother and Donnita's  15-minute oral surgery.? Give me a break.?? But, the 
most heart  wrenching thing is, until today, you never gave it a second 
thought. How would  you have felt if I had not been there for you? The final 
blow, though, was the  realization that you would take time to be with 
somebody else's mother and take  an entire day off for Donnita's oral 
surgery.? Actions speak louder than  words.
?
I'll get over this.? In fact, I've gotten it  off my chest and this is the 
end of it.? But, I cannot help but wonder, and  I want you both to answer 
this truthfully, if it had been your father, would you  have been there?? 
Just curious.? You reap what you sow.? I guess  I was not very good at the 
sowing part.
?
Love, Mom

Engram was easily in my top 30 or 25 recievers while shroeder was barely in

to do a trade with me?  Could it be my team is better than you keep saying.  
I think you are simply trying to get over on me like Harry did Lenhart.

a downgrade at receiver and an extra back who has not had a carry in the NFL

engram is ramiro's 4th receiver, you don't get a starting rb (the 10th best

LSU Is Ranked Party School Champ
Distinction Disappoints University  Officials
BATON ROUGE, La., Updated 9:13 p.m. CDT August 16, 2000 --It's a  distinction
officials at Louisiana State University wanted to avoid, but now  the word is
out: LSU has been ranked the No. 1 party school in the Princeton  Review of
the nation's top colleges.
Despite seminars on alcohol abuse and  new policies for fraternities and
sororities regarding alcohol consumption,  LSU edged out the University of
Alabama for the top spot. The University of  Texas ""won"" third place.
Chancellor Mark Emmert said LSU is no more a party  school than any other
university.
The Princeton ranking was disheartening  news to university officials still
shaken after the Aug. 19, 1997, death of  an LSU student who drank
excessively during a celebration of his acceptance  into a fraternity.
Brigham Young University was dubbed the top ""Stone Cold  Sober"" school in the
review.

The top 20 ""Party Schools,"" according to the Princeton Review:
1.  Louisiana State University
2. University of Alabama
3. University of  Texas
4. Florida State University
5. University of Colorado
6.  University of Tennessee
7. University of California at Santa Cruz
8.  Tulane University
9. University of Wisconsin
10. Ohio University,  Athens
11. University of New Hampshire
12. University of Michigan

15. New York  University
16. Lehigh University
17. Southern Methodist University
18.  University of Florida
19. University of California at Santa Barbara

              A MESSAGE FROM DONALD L. EVANS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Friend,

The election results in Florida have been certified in accordance
with Florida state law and the rulings of the Florida Supreme
Court, and Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney have won that
state's 25 electoral votes.  It is now time to get on with the
business of organizing a new administration.

In order to begin that task, we have filed articles of
incorporation for the Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition
Foundation, a non-profit corporation.  As past transition
foundations have done, we have applied for 501(c)(4) status from
the Internal Revenue Service.  Now we are asking for your help as
our team moves forward with plans for an orderly transition
process in the short period between now and inauguration day,
January 20, 2001.

While the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, as amended in
1988, specifically authorizes public funds for transitions, it
also makes provisions for raising contributions from private
sources to help defray transition-related expenses.  This has
been done previously, most recently in 1992.  We are now
soliciting contributions from our most active supporters.  Would
you please visit our new transition website at
http://www.bushcheneytransition.com and make a contribution on our
secure server?  AOL link: <a href=http://www.bushcheneytransition.com/>Bush + 
Cheney Transition</a>

We have made the decision to accept contributions only from
individuals.  No corporate or political action committee
contributions will be accepted.  Contributions may not exceed
$5,000 per person or $10,000 per couple, and all contributors, in
compliance with Governor Bush's position of full-disclosure of
financial contributions, will be posted on the transition website
on a real-time basis.  These contributions will not count against
an individual's annual political contribution federal giving
limit of $25,000

The American voters have spoken, and we are moving forward to
establish a government that will unify our country and make the
common principles we share as Americans our first priority.

If you have questions, please contact the Transition Foundation's
finance office at 512-344-3722.  All other transition inquiries
should be directed to our office in McLean, VA at (703) 918-2900.
Your support of the Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition
Foundation is deeply appreciated.

Sincerely,

Donald L. Evans
Board of Directors
Bush-Cheney Presidential Transition Foundation, Inc.

   A new book that says men may beat their wives has caused an outcry in
Turkey.
   The Guardian newspaper reports that ""The Muslim's Handbook,"" written by
retired cleric Kemil Gubran, advised men not to hit too hard and to avoid
the face. It also said that if a man's wife is ill and he can't afford a
servant, he could take a second wife.
   The book was published by the state-funded Pious Foundation, which is
affiliated with Turkey's religious directorate. In the past decade, the
directorate -- which appoints Muslim clerics and dictates topics for
mosques -- has been presenting a modern interpretation of Islam to include
expanded roles and rights for women.
   ""I am outraged that such a book was published with state funds, with
money women paid in taxes,"" said Zuhal Krilic, the head of Kader, a group
promoting women in politics.
   A book published in Spain several weeks ago also said a Muslim man could
beat his wife -- and included tips and instructions -- although it
counseled that the best way to bring a woman in line was through verbal abuse.

Dan,

Sorry to keep bothering you, but does what we talked about earlier pertain to 
EOL trades as well given the language in those contracts, i.e. requiring 
outside parties to honor contracts if they claim ""force majeure""?


Thanks,

Subject: I need your help!!

Michael Taylor is a summer intern from LSU, finance major, who has been 
working in Logistics for the Central Desk.  He will be at ENA for the next 
couple of weeks (through 8/11, I believe).  He has not had an opportunity to 
really see our business from the trading perspective or Risk perspective.  I 
had the opportunity to have lunch with Mike yesterday, and we brainstormed on 
some options to get him some exposure to these areas prior to leaving ENA.  
THis where I need your help!

Eric - As I always do, I sang your praises to Mike, and I thought you would 
be a good person for Mike to sit with to observe your current role in the 
analyst program on the Texas Trading Desk.  Additionally, since you were in 
Risk also, I thought you could give him an insightful perspective of how the 
Risk experience has helped you to move to your current role.  If you can 
swing it, I think it would be great if Mike could sit with you one day, and 
you could explain to him your job, your thoughts behind your actions, the 
data you watch, etc.  Obviously, the intent is educational, not 
interference.  So I will leave it to the two of you to work out the best 
approach and timing.

Dave - As I mentioned to you yesterday, I sang your praises also to Mike, and 
I'm glad the two of you were able to meet.  As we discussed, Mike would like 
to have some exposure to the Risk role, so it would be nice if he could sit 
with the group when the books and position are being calced.  I will leave it 
to the two of you to coordinate the day.

Mike's current role in Logistics brings him into the office at 4:00am to 
prepare the morning report.  As I understand it, his responsibilities are 
critical up until trading.  So late morning and early afternoon might be the 
best time, but you all can work through it.  When he sits with Risk, he'll 
probably go home and them return when you all start calcing.

George - Obviously Mike's first responsibilities are to Central Logistics, 
and these other opportunities are really on his own time.  We just thought it 
would be good for him to have a Risk/Trading perspective when he is trying to 
evaluate job opportunities.  I appreciate your support in this, but please 
let me know if you have any concerns.

When Mike leaves excelr, he will be going to Seattle to participate in 
MicroSoft's co-op program for the reaminder of 2000.  Obviously, he will have 
a great company to compare us to but at the end of the day, we want to ensure 
he has a great perspective on the opportunities that excelr can offer.  I 
appreciate your time to help Mike.

Warm fuzzies from Andy Rooney

I've learned....
    that the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an elderly person.
'   that when you're in love, it shows.
    that just one person saying to me, ""You've made my day!"" makes my day.
    that having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the most peaceful
feelings in     the world.

I've learned....
    that being kind is more important than being right.
    that you should never say no to a gift from a child.
    that I can always pray for someone when I don't have the strength to help
him in  some other way.

I've learned....
    that no matter how serious your life requires you to be, everyone needs a
friend  to act goofy with.
    that sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a heart to
understand.
    that simple walks with my father around the block on summer nights when I
was     a child did wonders for me as an adult.

I've learned....
    that life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets to the end,
the faster it   goes.
    that we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for.
    that money doesn't buy class.
    that it's those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular.

I've learned....
    that under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be appreciated
and     loved.
    that the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me think  I can?
    that to ignore the facts does not change the facts.
    that when you plan to get even with someone, you are only letting that
person  continue to hurt you.

I've learned....
    that love, not time, heals all wounds.
    that the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to surround myself
with    people smarter than I am.
    that everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.
    that there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and feeling
their   breath on your cheeks.

I've learned....
    that no one is perfect until you fall in love with them.
    that life is tough, but I'm tougher.
    that opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you miss.
    that when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere.

I've learned....
    that one should keep his words both soft and tender, because tomorrow he
may     have to eat them.
    that a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.
    that I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it.

I've learned....
    that when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in his
little fist, that   you're hooked for life.
    that everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness
and     growth occurs while you're climbing it.
    that it is best to give advice in only two circumstances; when it is
requested and   when it is a life-threatening situation.
    that the less time I have to work with, the more things I get done.

meeting I expect the results will be released to each of your PRC 
Supervisors.  You should expect them to complete your performance evaluation 
and schedule a meeting with you to discuss it.  If they do not, it is up to

Again, I enjoyed the opportunity to meet each of you and learn a bit of what 
you do.  I look forward learning even more.

Big 12: Applewhite eager to reclaim his job
By Mark Wangrin
Express-News Staff Writer

AUSTIN =01* It runs up and down the inside of Major Applewhite's left knee,=
 a=20
four-inch shiny pink speed bump of a scar.=20

If it could talk, it would tell of how the anterior cruciate ligament buckl=
ed=20
as its owner planted while trying to avoid a relentless Arkansas pass rush =
at=20
the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1.

It would tell of the reconstructive surgery by team orthopedist Dr. Carey=
=20
Windler, how the joint was whipped back into shape with hours of work and=
=20
carefully tended with ice bags and heat and extra stretching and anything=
=20
else Applewhite had read, heard or seen that would help keep his return on=
=20
pace.

If the joint could talk, it would tell people how everything's fine inside,=
=20
how Applewhite could drop back and plant, set up or scramble, in a real liv=
e=20
game today if one was scheduled.=20

If it could talk ... well, Applewhite might well be the happiest guy on the=
=20
planet.

Being a quarterback, team guy and newly inaugurated Student Government=20
representative, Applewhite tries to be diplomatic, but part of him wishes h=
e=20
wouldn't have to answer a steady barrage of questions about his knee, no=20
matter how well-meaning the fans might be.

""I don't want to be rude,"" he said last week. ""I just wish they'd stop=20
asking. I love them, appreciate them, but it's getting a little ...""

Got the picture.

OK. So here's the word: Applewhite is 100 percent =01* even ahead of schedu=
le.

Ready to take on the challenge to his starting job from sophomore quarterba=
ck=20
Chris Simms, who with only one career start has graced the cover of The=20
Sporting News football preview and had an ESPN Magazine cover shoot last we=
ek

This word on Applewhite's fitness comes not just from the junior player, bu=
t=20
from the man who's worked most closely with him, physical therapist Allen=
=20
Hardin.

Applewhite, Hardin stresses unequivocally, is ready to play now.

Hardin said Applewhite has tested 5 to 10 percent above the expected range=
=20
when he's had periodic strength and flexibility tests on the injured leg.=
=20
During rehab, Hardin ditched the pool work, concentrating instead on=20
sport-specific movements, shortly after Applewhite observed that very few=
=20
football games are played under water.

One of the most effective of the workouts involved pulling on Applewhite wi=
th=20
rubber tubing as the quarterback moved, cut and set up, strengthening his=
=20
supporting muscles and improving his balance.

""If I came in and told him to do what he did yesterday, he wasn't happy,=20
because he wanted to be challenged,"" Hardin said. ""It was a challenge to co=
me=20
up with things to challenge him.""

""The only difference I can tell about the knee is it takes longer to warm=
=20
up,"" Applewhite said. ""I'll jog for four minutes instead of two, stretch fo=
r=20
six minutes instead of five.""

After workouts, Applewhite dutifully ices his knee, though he does so based=
=20
more on conventional wisdom than necessity.

""I've always heard you can get tendinitis, so I ice it,"" he said. ""I don't=
=20
have any of the symptoms, so it feels like I'm icing it for no reason.""

In some ways, Applewhite feels he's better for the injury, not the least of=
=20
which being a renewed appreciation for the game.

""So what if I'm tired?"" he said. ""I can rest when I die.""

Resting now isn't a bad thing, either. Applewhite said missing spring drill=
s=20
was a boon for his arm.

""I was throwing so much during the spring (of 1999), summer and season that=
=20
it felt like my arm was run ragged,"" he said.

Of course, the knee questions will be answered the first time Applewhite=20
takes a hit in the fall. The other question, the one that he can't shake,=
=20
will take a little longer.

Who's the starter going to be =01* Applewhite or Simms?

""I'd be quick to drop in comments about Chris,"" Hardin said of his=20
occasional, and apparently unnecessary, mention of Simms as a motivational=
=20
ploy. ""But I think internally, he'd have worked that hard whatever.""

""It's remarkable the way he's come back,"" said sophomore cornerback Roderic=
k=20
Babers, noting that Applewhite has been occasionally overthrowing even the=
=20
speediest receivers in workouts. ""In two-a-days, it'll be a fair fight.""

Asked to size up how Applewhite and Simms have looked in informal workouts,=
=20
Babers said, ""I think (Simms) has the advantage. Major's been sitting out a=
nd=20
Simms' confidence is up, big-time. That's what you need in a quarterback. B=
ut=20
at the same time, Major's a veteran. He's beaten Nebraska. He's beaten them=
=20
all.""

""He's the same old Major,"" cornerback Quentin Jammer said.

Soon Applewhite will probably be as tired of talking about the quarterback=
=20
duel as he is about answering questions about the state of his knee. Now, a=
=20
month before the freshmen report on Aug. 13, he's talking about how he's no=
t=20
competing against Simms, just against himself.

""The competitive nature that Tiger Woods has is the competitive nature I=20
have,"" Applewhite said. ""At Pebble Beach, Tiger was up 15 and had a 10-foot=
er=20
on the last hole for birdie, and he was out there lining it up. He could ha=
ve=20
done the 'Happy Gilmore' tap to the hole and still won. But he wanted it al=
l.""

Simms has bulked up from 208 to 223 pounds, working on his leg and upper bo=
dy=20
strength.

""I feel like there's more to me now, that it's not like the wind's going to=
=20
blow me over,"" he said. ""I don't want to be a wimpy quarterback. I want to =
be=20
like Brett Favre. He's not the biggest or the fastest, but he can run when =
he=20
has to and he can chuck it 80 (yards).

""It's going to come, and it'll get worse,"" Simms said of the building=20
scrutiny. ""To tell you the truth, I don't care. Football's a competitive=20
sport. There's nothing you can do about it.""

So he shrugs it off for now, concentrating on finishing up summer school.=
=20
He's working on his topic for a writing course, ""History of American=20
Baseball."" The book he chose is about Babe Ruth.

In August, the topic switches to college football. The question remains the=
=20
same. And Chris Simms, or Major Applewhite, won't write this story.

They'll live it.

As we head into your FF Playoffs, weather is a real factor in many games.
Knowing how it will affect your players can be huge.  With that in mind, I'm
pleased to introduce our Weather Guru, Mike McVay.  Mike's a Meteorologist
with WOWK - TV in West Virginia.  He also happens to be a very successful
Fantasy Football Fanatic.  What a deal.  Not unlike when I call on my
Physician friends for injury advice, Mike will offer his expert insights to
give you a sneak peek at how the weather may affect key games.

I'll see you early Thursday morning with our Matchups to Avoid and Exploit
and Players in the News.  In the meantime, here's an early look at some
developing weather situations that could affect your players this weekend.
Thanks Mike!

SEATTLE @ DENVER:  This one is worth monitoring.  The last game at Mile High
this year could get interesting.  A major snow storm will be brewing in the
Rockies on Sunday and heavy snow could cause problems for both the Seahawks
and Broncos.  Safest bets here are with the RBs.  What initially looks like
a high scoring game on paper, may actually become a ground game with a lot
of turnovers resulting in a low final score.

DETROIT @ GREEN BAY:  More snow potential here.  Not a major storm, but
possibly enough to once again affect the passing game.  I'd shy away from
QBs and WRs if you have better options.

CAROLINA @ KANSAS CITY:  This game will be ugly for the fans at Arrowhead. A
cold, steady rain with temps in the 30s for the start of this one.  The
Chiefs can't run the football, so this one could get interesting. Carolina's
Defense might actually be worth a gamble in this one.

CINCINNATI @ TENNESSEE:  Showers are likely throughout the game, but with
these two teams it shouldn't matter.  They both like running the football
anyway.

NEW ENGLAND @ CHICAGO:  I think the rain/snow will hold off until after game
time in this one.

PHILADELPHIA @ CLEVELAND:  Slight chance for rain/snow showers, but
shouldn't affect the game much.

TAMPA BAY @ MIAMI:  Slight chance for showers, but both of these teams are
used to this kind of weather.

 WAKE UP AMER  A, THIS IS WHY OUR
 FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND
 AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION

Where We're Headed
    By Robert A. Waters
****************************************************************

 You're sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your
 bedroom door.

 Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled
 whispers. At least two people have broken into your house
 and are moving your way.

 With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed
 and pick up your shotgun. You rack a shell into the
 chamber, then inch toward the door and open it.

 In the darkness, you make out two shadows. One holds a
 weapon--it looks like a crowbar.

 When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the
 shotgun and fire. The blast knocks both thugs to the floor.
 One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to
 the front door and lurches outside.

 As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're
 in trouble. In your country, most guns were outlawed years
 before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently
 regulated as to make them useless.
 Yours was never registered.

 Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died.
 They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal
 Possession of a Firearm.

 When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry:
 authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter.
 ""What kind of sentence will I get?"" you ask.
 ""Only ten-to-twelve years,"" he replies, as if that's nothing.
 ""Behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven.""

 The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local
 newspaper. Somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric
 vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir
 boys. Their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say
 about them. Buried deep down in the article, authorities
 acknowledge that both ""victims"" have been arrested numerous
 times. But the next day's headline says it all:
 ""Lovable Rogue Son Didn't Deserve to Die."" The thieves have
 been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type
 pranksters.

 As the days wear on, the story takes wings. The national media
 picks it up, then the international media.

 The surviving burglar has become a folk hero. Your attorney
 says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win.

 The media publishes reports that your home has been
 burglarized several times in the past and that you've been
 critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the
 suspects. After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you
 would be prepared next time. The District Attorney uses this to
 allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.

 A few months later, you go to trial. The charges haven't been
 reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted. When
 you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works
 against you. Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean,
 vengeful man.

 It doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.

 The judge sentences you to life in prison.

__________________________________________

 This case really happened.

***********************************
 On August 22, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk, England,
 killed one burglar and wounded a second. In April, 2000, he was
 convicted and is now serving a life term.

 How did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the
 once-great British Empire?

 It started with the Pistols Act of 1903. This seemingly
 reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and
 established that handgun sales were to be made only to those
 who had a license. The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing
 to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns.
 Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of
 any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of
 all shotguns.

 Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after
 the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987. Michael Ryan, a
 mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down
 the streets shooting everyone he saw. When the smoke cleared,
 17 people were dead.

 The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of ""gun
 control"", demanded even tougher restrictions. (The seizure of all
 privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan
 used a rifle.)

 Nine years later, at Dunblane, Scotland, Thomas Hamilton used
 a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at
 a public school.

 For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as
 mentally unstable, or worse, criminals. Now the press had a real
 kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners. Day after day,
 week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and
 demanded a total ban on all handguns.
 The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the
 few sidearms still owned by private citizens.

 During the years in which the British government incrementally
 took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right
 to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism. Authorities
 refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened,
 claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to
 own a gun. Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were
 charged while the real criminals were released. Indeed, after the
 Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, ""We
 cannot have people take the law into their own hands.""

 All of Martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and
 several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young
 thugs who had no fear of the consequences. Martin himself, a
 collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or
 stolen by burglars.

 When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns
 were given three months to turn them over to local authorities.
 Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law. The few
 who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year
 prison sentences if they didn't comply.

 Police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 200,000 handguns
 from private citizens.

 How did the authorities know who had handguns?

 The guns had been registered and licensed. Kinda like cars.

 Sound familiar?

 FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND
 AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION.

Eric,

Let me introduce myself.  I am currently Director of Tax for the excelr India 
business unit and have been with excelr in various Tax functions for 
approximately 5 years.  I have been asked to sit on the excelr Corp. 
Performance Review Committee as PRC Representative for a group of  18 
Analysts, including you.  Your 6/2000 performance results will be presented 
to the PRC on 19-July PRC, along with all other Analysts.  

I want to make certain we both take full advantage of the PRC process.  To 
that end, I need you to bring me up-to-speed on your pre-excelr background and 
what you have accomplished while at excelr, in particular during the 6/2000 
review period, and what you intend to accomplish this year (your ""goals"").  
With this information, I can be best prepared to speak of your achievments 
during the 19-July PRC presentation.  

Here's what I need -

resume (most recent is fine,  even if out of date)
name of your ""PRC Supervisor"" ( i.e., the person who has gathered your 6/2000 
Feedback)
location and phone extension
your goals for the 2000 year (if these were not formalized, I would 
appreciate your doing so)
accomplishments this review period (especially toward achievement of your 
stated goals)
outside activities which support the community, especially those where your 
represent ""excelr"" (e.g., charitable endeavors)
other activities you are involved in which support ""excelr"" as a whole (e.g., 
college recruiting)

One last thing, please forgive the somewhat impersonal use of email.  I would 
like to meet you in person and hope that we can arrange that early next 
week.  Would you be available Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon (11/12-July) for 
30 minutes?  We could use that time to run through your background materials.

Please furnish the name of your ""PRC Supervisor"" by email ( my list indicates 
it is Tom Martin ) so that  I can contact them for a copy of the business 
unit PRC materials that should have recently been completed for you.

Thanks for your help ... I look forward to meeting you !

If you are currently an analyst in a commercial rotation, then you are 
eligible for promotion to a third year analyst.  After you have completed 
your third year, then you are eligible for promotion to a commercial 
associate.  These guidelines were effective on 6/1/2000.  The conversation 
that you and I had was prior to these changes.   Effective 6/1/2000, the 
Office of the Chairman has made it very clear that we are to adhere to these 
promotion guidelines going forward.

Subject: Program Changes

Celeste,

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Subject: Going To London!

Hi Everyone,

Well, it's official.  I am finally making the final arrangements for my move 
to London!  I leave Friday, July 14th, but before I go I would like to throw 
a going away bash.  It's been awhile since we've all been out together so I 
hope you can make it.  I am sure that I have forgotten people, so please 
forward the email on.

The festivities will commence at my apartment next Friday, July 7th....at my 
apartment.  I'll be providing beer and wine but feel free to bring your 
favorite beverage.  I live a block away from the Galant Knight...if you can't 
make it to the apartment, meet up with us at the Galant Knight on Holcombe.

I live at 7777 Greenbriar #3056.  My gate code is 284.  If you need 
directions, leave me a message on my voice mail and I'll call you 
back...since I will out on vacation for most of next week.

I hope to see you all!

Carrie

my next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th).  I hear it is a real good 
group to work with (real smart and nice people)- but I think they put in a 
lot of overtime- especially during federal compliance and some during state 
compliance time.  Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so 
going before I rotate in August  might not be a bad idea- although I really 
think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.  Side

have NO motivation and I am about to enter a group that has lots of OT.  You 
do realize that I am never going to pass that exam- and I'll probably lose my 
job- and then either you or my family will just have to take care of me.  I 
am feeling a little stressed/anxious today for some reason- in case you 
didn't pick up on that.  I definately feel like I need a vacation.

compliance time.  Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so 
going before I rotate in August  might not be a bad idea- although I really 
think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.  Side 
thought- when in the hell am I going to study for the CPA- especially since I 
have NO motivation and I am about to enter a group that has lots of OT.  You 
do realize that I am never going to pass that exam- and I'll probably lose my 
job- and then either you or my family will just have to take care of me.  I 
am feeling a little stressed/anxious today for some reason- in case you 
didn't pick up on that.  I definately feel like I need a vacation.

my next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th).  I hear it is a real good

It is coming up on that time again.  The most glorious time of year.  The 
time of the year when life begins anew.  No, not spring, FOOTBALL SEASON!

That being said, it is time to start thinking about fantasy football again.

I need to know who of you is interested in playing again, and any suggestions 
on rule changes (i.e. scoring, fees, etc.). I was thinking about having the 
draft in late August.

Let me know if you have any friends that you think might want to play.

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Update:

The aggies have played and are awaiting a UT team challenger.    I think the 
only thing at stake here is the trophy and I don't know what there is terms 
of ref's, a field, etc.

If you would like to field a team to play the aggies, lemme know.   Webb has 
informed me that he does not have enough players and thus there will be no 
playoff for the excelr Texas team.  We can still put a team together by 
combining those of you who would like to play.  Otherwise, I think Texas made 
it's case after Thanksgiving and I'm not going to pursue this any further..

Look man, you started this shit by bringing up the same cheap EES comments 
that you always do when you have nothing better to say.  When I have to put 
up with that lack of respect from you on a daily basis, I consider it below 
the belt.  I would have liked to keep this to the game, but for some reason 
you always add the bit about EES.  Besides, don't throw Brenda choosing 
between you and Heidi in my face.  That doesn't add much credibility.

Between friends,  life and work are not constant competitions to see who's 
smarter or who makes more money.  I was genuinely happy for you when you 
decided to stay on at the desk.  As a matter of fact, I remember giving you 
advice, as a friend, on that very subject.  I hold no resentment or jealousy 
that you got it and I didn't.  I wouldn't have taken it anyway.  I neither 
liked my job in risk or felt that I was exceptional at it.  But, I did it 
well enough to bide time and move on to something that I'm more suited for.  
My move to EES wasn't a banishment, but a choice.  It was a risk that paid 
off very well.  Of course you are better at what you do than I.  But I 
seriously doubt you could be as effective as I am in front of a Customer or 
managing a project.  It's all about what you do well and being happy with 
that.  I'm glad we both are, but attempting to make me or my position less 
important because I don't work on the trading floor is just typical ENA 
arrogant bullshit.

....And you have no history about getting hammered and hooking up with skanks 
(i.e. Indian Princess.)  At least I don't take them on dates (that was 
justified.)  Now let's cut this crap and move on. 

Or I'll send my Dad to beat up your Dad.

The Tigers wear the mantle of favorite well. They have won
                    nine straight games in postseason play, including the 
Southeastern
                    Conference tournament. They are relatively healthy. They 
have power
                    hitters, they have patient hitters, and they can field 
better than recent
                    versions of the club. Best of all, they have a lot of 
arms, and they have
                    Bertman around to use them.

			Mock draft No. 1: Mihm's the word
			
?			
			
			
			
			
			
?	By Andy Katz
	ESPN.com
	
	With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere 
between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential 
of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.
	
	NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking 
heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft 
camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of 
talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several 
projections we'll have on ESPN.com.
	
	A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but 
could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing 
in Chicago.
	
	The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a 
chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center 
Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason 
Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard 
Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point 
guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State 
junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey 
forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.
	
	Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next 
month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must 
decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until 
June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and 
Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what 
happens.
	
	ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock 
draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.
	
	
	
	
	Chris Mihm
	
	Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.
	
	1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and 
could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets 
could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next 
season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.
	
	2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be 
getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player 
in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer. 
Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the 
Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.
	
	3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have 
already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward 
(which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him 
defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to 
return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door 
open for a return.
	
	4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center 
for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next 
in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better 
offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.
	
	5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles 
but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic 
an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last 
season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.
	
	6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on 
Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better 
scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta 
wants a small forward over a big guard.
	
	7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can 
package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be 
solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy 
McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would 
have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.
	
	8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the 
third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too, 
but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for 
size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are 
split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.
	
	9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go 
higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce 
during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson, 
DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over 
a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.
	
	10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.): 
The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their 
three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has 
scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without 
feeling pressured to play him next season.
	
	11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past 
11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but 
can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from 
Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much 
different.
	
	12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don 
Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the 
Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a 
foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts 
and in Chicago -- if he shows.
	
	13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to 
take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough 
to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the 
point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching 
because of his leadership and toughness.
	
	14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't 
let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next 
to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go 
higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.
	
	15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power 
forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift. 
None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a 
rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the 
Pacers.
	
	16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a 
backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under 
any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind 
Cleaves. 
	
	17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed, 
he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit 
all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the 
Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement 
Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs. 
	
	18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers 
need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that 
some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of 
being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.
	
	19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up 
into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will 
catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of 
his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The 
Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.
	
	20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have 
already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off 
the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first 
round, regardless of where he's being picked.
	
	21. Toronto -- Craig ""Speedy"" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have 
already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If 
Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural 
pick for the Raptors.
	
	22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some 
heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical 
players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big. 
Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.
	
	23. Utah -- Hanno M""tt""l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with 
picking M""tt""l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end 
up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small 
forward. If M""tt""l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first 
round.
	
	24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point 
guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most 
intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard 
positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the 
Bulls some versatility on the floor.
	
	25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another 
big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor 
together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns 
have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.
	
	26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism 
and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason. 
Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could 
still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.
	
	27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave 
reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early 
without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers 
have a history of going younger in the draft.
	
	28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers 
don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to 
jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking 
skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many 
miles left in his legs.
	
	29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's 
where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or 
Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the 
Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.

Yes, we have finally suckered some other excelr group into taking on Bryan 
Hull.  Just teasin', Bryan's last day with the Risk Team will be this Friday, 
June 2nd.  It wouldn't be right if we didn't send him off without his well 
deserved roasting.

This Thursday evening at 5:30 we will gather at Teala's on W. Dallas to bid 
Bryan farewell.

For future reference, Bryan will be joining the EOL group on the 26th floor 
on Monday, June 5th.  His extension will be the same so feel free to continue 
to harass him. 

See ya there! 

If, in haste, we have left anyone off our distribution please forward the 
invite on.

Thanx!

Update:

The aggies have played and are awaiting a UT team challenger.    I think the 
only thing at stake here is the trophy and I don't know what there is terms 
of ref's, a field, etc.

If you would like to field a team to play the aggies, lemme know.   Webb has 
informed me that he does not have enough players and thus there will be no 
playoff for the excelr Texas team.  We can still put a team together by 
combining those of you who would like to play.  Otherwise, I think Texas made 
it's case after Thanksgiving and I'm not going to pursue this any further..

Webb, where are you as far as setting up a time with the aggies?    I think

Subject: 24 x 5 Products

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, 
May 24th. 

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas 
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in 
that the Product  description has an 
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day 
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these Products based 
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are 
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably - 
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days 
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider 
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low, 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.

Subject: Well Head Accrual Income Calculation

Eric,

We've reviewed your wellhead accrual income data for February, 2000 and 
present our input on the attachment.  Generally, we have a few minor 
questions relating to the Comstock/Sun deals (do improper prior bookings 
account for the difference between the purchase price in some cases - ie. 
$2.477 vs. 2.508?) and certain deals do not appear to be wellhead related 
(Western Gas 500752 & 507804 and Pan Energy 500560).  The dollar amount 
involved are quite minor.

I believe, on a going forward basis, the large Coastal negative number 
($92,233) will disappear beginning on 4/1/2000.  As we discussed, would you 
therefore provide us with your wellhead accrual income data for April, 2000 
so we can see the net effect of correcting the Coastal booking?  Thanks.

Are the facility fees part of the accrual piece we are holding out for Greg 
Sharp?  If not, how can we find the deals we have held out value to cover 
these fees?

Things to Remember:
We cannot see the future. We cannot change the past.
We can only live in the now with an eye towards
gaining enough power in the future to wreak revenge on
everyone who ever screwed us in the past.

Dreaming frees the soul, energizes the spirit and
allows you to do things that would get your ass thrown
in jail if you really tried them.

Love means never having to say, ""Does that twenty
include the spanking?

To truly love another, you must first love yourself.
And it wouldn't kill you to wash your hands in between
either.

A little bit of love goes a long way in our lives. It
can provide us with higher highs and lower lows. But,
if it comes with a persistent burning sensation, see
your physician.

When it becomes a crime to love, you should probably
consider dating outside the family.

If Life hands you lemons today, smile and give thanks.
Then when Life isn't looking, give him a quick knee to
the groin. That'll learn him.

They say a smile is a gift which is free to the giver
and precious to the recipient. But giving the finger
is free, too, and I find it more personal and sincere.

We have access to a pretty realistic (close to actual) physical throughput 
number going back to about February of 1998.  Anything prior to that would 
take some work to come up with.  If you are looking for a scheduled 
throughput number the best place to get that data from would be POP's/Unify.  
By totalling all of the reciept or delivery contracts and including any 
Bammel activity, you should get a pretty accurate scheduled throughput 
number.  You just have to make sure you don't double dip on gas going through 
processing plants, partnership activity, etc.

Let me know what you and Ed are looking for and we can help pull the data 
together.

Michael - can you give me an idea of where we are in uploading the Specs for 
this.

Eric, our biggest concern with this right now is the valuation for the 
Products that you would see in your Position Summary. We know that is we 
passed these trades through the system as a straight month-long transaction, 
that the valuation would be wrong. Additionally, the start and end dates will 
skue the valuation based on which day of the week the first calendar day of 
the month falls on and which day of the week the last calendar day of the 
month falls on. Using a straight 5/7 valuation methodology is only going to 
get you 'close' to true value in the Position Summary. Hence, the specs sent 
to Mike that you see in the e-mail below will need to be built.

In short, Eol was not set up to readily accept this valuation methodology. We 
will get you as close as we can, and we will give you some idea of how close 
these Position Values will be. 

Also, can you confirm that you intent to always and ONLY trade this Product 
during bid week?

I owe you a spec. re. this and here it is:

Mark & Michael,
Remember we had discussed this when you were here.
The question is ......................in EOL Reports there is a Position 
Summary Report and in Stack Manager there is the Transaction Summary.
will these calculate properly on the 24x5 product? The start date & end date 
will imply every day but the product excludes weekends.

We have finsihed creating and testing a the new 24x5 Nat Gas Product (a month 
long transaction which only moves gas Mon-Fri). A final question has come up 
- how will these be calculated. Jennifer is under the impression that 
something was being built in the EOL Position Summary Report that would be 
able to calculate these kinds of trades. Is that the case? Has that been done?

Subject: Re: Wellhead Accrual Income

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =

Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =       
$100,000
Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000

Total Value =                                   $177,000

March - 

Total Accrual Value = $292,145

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid =

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

Subject: Re: New Product  

Since the Product Type description is ""US Gas Basis"", it is implied that the 
swap is against last day NYMEX and some othe MONTHYL CONTRACT PRICE, which is 
why we specify GD/D, so the viewer knows its a NYMEX last day vs. Gas Daily 
Average price. Take a look at the Indexes used in the other Basis swaps that 
are out there and you'll see what I mean.
I'm a little concerned about the request for Agua Dulce and Carthage. If 
memory serves me, Elsa tried to push these through earlier and it was 
determined that gas at these delivery points was interruptable. Interruptable 
gas is NOT offered on EOL. PLease check with Elsa on this.

Dale,

On the new Gas Daily product that you are setting up, I think it would be a 
good idea to have a Nymex reference in the short description.  Something 
like, US Gas Daily NX GD/D HSC. 


In addtion, we need two new index locations set up, Carthage hub and Agua 
Dulce hub.  Please contact Todd Richardson for further details on these.

Thanks for your help.

Thanks to all of you for your generosity and support of the MS-150.  This 
year's event was another huge success, with over 8,000 riders participating 
in the 180 mile bike ride to Austin.  excelr once again had the largest team, 
breaking the national record with over 400 riders.  This year, the MS Society 
expects to set a new fundraising record of over $3 million.  With your 
support, excelr will again be the top fund-raising team with over $350,000 in 
pledges to date.  Rest assured that your money will be put to good use in 
Multiple Sclerosis research as we try to find a cure for this terrible 
disease.  

The conditions were absolutely perfect this past weekend.  The race started 
off at 7am Saturday morning from Tully Stadium in Houston.  Team excelr once 
again had the privilege of starting first in the race.  Things were going 
pretty well for me until mile 6, when another biker veered into my rear 
wheel.  Luckily, I managed not to fall and no one was hurt, but my wheel was 
completely bent.  I eventually found a support vehicle to take me to the 
first rest stop where they could do the repairs.  Unfortunately, it took me 
over 2 hours to get my bike fixed.  So much for the early start!

The rest of the day went smoothly, and I was able to make up most of the time 
I had lost in the morning by riding through the rest stops.  After lunch in 
Bellville, the roads had a few more hills, but the wind was cooperative all 
the way to LaGrange, the midway point of the race.  In LaGrange, excelr 
treated us to massages, a barbeque dinner, and cold beer, all much 
appreciated after 100 miles of riding.  The atmosphere in the camp is a lot 
of fun, with a band playing and riders filtering in all evening long with 
stories about the day's ride.  

The next morning, we got up bright and early at 5am for the MS Society's 
famous pancake breakfast.  We needed the carbohydrates because the second day 
features the infamous Bastrop State Park and its killer hills.  My legs were 
a little stiff the next morning, but after the first few miles I was warmed 
up and ready to go.  I cruised through most of the morning until Bastrop.  
For the record, the hills in the park aren't half as bad as people say.  It's 
actually one of my favorite parts of the ride because it's shaded by trees, 
and you get a lot of momentum going down the hills.  Once we were out of the 
park, lunch was only a few miles away.  I scarfed down some Subway sandwiches 
and brownies, refilled my Camelback, and was ready to go again.  Only 40 
miles left!  

After breezing through the first 20 miles, I started to wear down a little.  
At the same time, the wind picked up, so the last 20 miles were probably the 
toughest part.  When you're that close to the finish line, you have to suck 
it up and keep going.  They post mile markers the last 4 miles, and you can 
feel the anticipation building.  The last mile of the race is packed with 
people on each side cheering you on.  It's quite a rush when you get to the 
end.  Upon arriving in Austin, I checked my bike on the truck back to Houston 
and enjoyed Hooter's chicken sandwiches and pasta salad.  What a ride!

Thanks again for your support.  Just to let you know, I'll be coming around 
next week to collect your pledge.  Your contribution is, of course, fully tax 
deductible.  excelr is also doubling all pledges (the Cycling Club is taking 
care of the paperwork, so no need to fill out a form).  


Hope to see you in the race next year!

Brian

Subject: Re: Wellhead Accrual Income

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =       
$105,000
Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =       
$100,000
Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $65,000           $113,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($95,000)
Total Value =                                   $177,000

March - 

Total Accrual Value = $292,145

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid =       
$106,000
Accrual Value =                               $59,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $66,000           $119,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($100,000)
Total Value =                                   $172,000

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value

Total Value =                                   $148,750

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you,

Hi guy. Ain't Misbehaving is the entertainment at  the Great Caruso. They 
have 2 shows, 5:15 or 8:45. No room at the inn for the  8:45 show, and we

Those numbers are all inclusive for the wellhead portfolio.  Sharp's number 
is embedded within those.  His number is estimated at approx $170,000/mo.  
I will follow up with these specific details.

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process.

60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly 
basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.

For example:

Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.

This means that:

Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000
Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000

Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000)
So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense
Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)

Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value
Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been 
previously recognized.
Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.

recent developments, I am not sure if everyone is still interested.  Please 
let me know if you will be interested in playing in the next session because 
I have already told the sportsplex that we will be playing.  If we decide not 
to play, I need to let them know ASAP and try and get the money back(forfeit 
deposit).  It is critical that I get a 100% response to this email to gauge 
whether or not we have enough people.  Due to the increased number of the 
people on the team working in risk, we will need as many bodies as possible 
due to the early games this session(they start this time at 6:30).  The 
season begins next wednesday.

Thanks again for a fun and memorable season and I hope we do it again(at

Multiple Monday - Friday, no flow during weekend periods) cannot be handled 
internally by EOL.  Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara 
bridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.  Because of this, there should be 
heighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.  These 
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually.

An effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications (EOL and 
Sitara) on how a deal with multi-periods can flow without human 
intervention.  This has not been started.  In the meantime, a deal of this 
nature will have to be entered manually.

How do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?  Once the EOL 
product has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.  
The person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what 
is meant by the EOL product's delivery period and enter the deal 
accordingly.  

For example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:

  Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara 
ticket
  
  Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07
   04/10  04/14
   04/17  04/21
   04/24  04/28 
  
 Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing

 Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade.

 Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open 
ended.  Every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date 
is on the path; otherwise
 the number of reconciling items will increase.

Please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted.

Any concerns, please contact Sheri Thomas or myself.

Eric -

Logistics is telling us that this product is not presently traded OTC. The 
Sitara group is telling us that we don't presently have the ability to 
support this product, which is probaby a result of the fact that is is 
unprecedented. 
To my knowledge EOL doesn't have the ability to eliminate specific dates 
between the Start Date and End Date.

David, essentially this product would be a calendar month long US Phys Gas 
contract where we DO NOT move gas on the weekends. 

Can we chat about this please.

My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in 
with logistics. We need to check with the Sitara Group to see if this is 
feasible. In the OTC world it's a lay-up because you can enter the different 
legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL 
is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates.

Scott Mills is out on vacation until Monday and he's the man I have to see. I 
will follow up with him next week.

OK- Would I have asked you if I didn't want you to go??  Just like a woman.

 In all honesty- if you don't want to go- I probably won't go either.  I am 
not a huge professional baseball fan- it is so slow!-  so to go to something 
like that I really need to enjoy the people that I am with.  Don't think that 
the tax department necessarily falls into that category- but would be 
bareable if you were there. Just a side thought- but my dad would be so mad 
if he knew I had the opportunity to go- but didn't.  Don't know why that just 
popped in my head.  I guess I write e-mails using ""stream of consciousness"" 
also.

Also- you know- you and Jennifer are a lot alike.  You know how you send me 
ugly e-mails when you are the last person on any group e-mail that I send 
out.  Well- she is even worse- she just called and yelled at me- b/c she was 
not the FIRST person on a group e-mail that I sent.

I'm moving this weekend to another apartment in the same complex.  We're
overlooking the pool now, so stop by and visit.  I've attached the new

Things here in Houston are going well.  I'm going to Eastern Europe March
29-April 11.  The tentative schedule is Budapest, Prague, Munich, Salzberg,
Vienna, and Marseille.  The weekend after I get back is the MS-150 bike ride

from Houston to Austin, so wish me luck!


Hope all's well,

My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in

legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL 
is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates.

Subject: Market Meters Breakout

Brenda,

I am going through the market meters right now and am finding the following 
results for February.

TOM $124,002
GREG      $9,285

I started the process by pulling all the meters and associated transport 
rates off the transport capacity tickets.  I pulled them based on the 
delivery rates being greater than the matrix.  I then researched the deals to 
pull the deal tickets.  If the deal occurred before 7/99, then I assigned the 
expense to Tom.  If the deal occurred after 7/99, then I looked at who the 
dealmaker was and based the assignment of the transport expense on who the 
dealmaker was.  In all cases, either Papayoti or Lamphier did the deal.

I also trued up the transport rate to the transport rate on the deal ticket.  
This includes occasions when the transport capacity ticket did not have a 
transport rate but the transport capacity ticket had an increased rate.  In 
other words, I defaulted to the deal ticket so that we could have a paper 
record of the transport rate.

As of now, I still have to pull January volume and attach the rate to the 
March transport.  I wanted to go through the full analysis first and now that 
I have the actual transport rate from the deal ticket, I know which rate to 
attach.

I will pursue these avenues next.  Please let me know what questions you have.


Heidi

Subject: Additional Transport Expense on Entex meters

Eric, I am checking the process now for incorporating all transport revenue 
due Ed for delivery meters in the Texas region.  The following meters have 
transport rates attached to them which are above and beyond the matrix rates 
Ed quotes to Tom.  I believe that we are already capturing all Ed's 
revenue/Tom's expense for this gas at these meters, but want to be sure of 
that.   Would you let me know if these are the meters for which we are 
manually moving around money from Tom to Ed for the residential portion of 
the Lufkin-Diboll volume?



I believe that the industrial portion of this volume is included already as 
part of Ducote's deal, and I believe that the residential portion is volume

Not too much going on in H-town.  I just recently started trading Natural Gas 
Futures.  I have had three heart attacks, a stroke, and have bitten off all 
of my fingers in a week.  Other than that things are going pretty well.

I should be in town for easter, so if you want to get together, lemme know.

Ok- I'm getting pissed off.  I came in today to work on a project- only to 
find out that my tax application is not set up to do what I need to do.  So- 
basically i can't even start on this until someone from out support team can 
come look at it- and you just don't understand- with our support team- that 
could take a day or two.  See that is the problem here- in EVERY person that 
I have worked with at excelr- NO ONE ever thinks ahead.  No one is a planner.  
Like- I am new in this group- why did no one consider the fact that I 
wouldn't have this on my desktop- and that it would take a while to get it- 
especially on a Friday- when half our staff is gone- b/c it is  THEIR Friday 
off!  

I'm leaving at noon- and I'm not coming back- I don't care if the application 
is fixed or not.  The other lady in our group- that today is her Friday off- 
she isn't coming in.  See I am getting tired of the fact- that they treat 
their rotators like interms around here.  That is basically what is pissing 
me off.  You get all the shit work- that no one else wants to do.  You are 
totally left out of the loop- like why wasn't I told b/4 6 o'clock last 
night- that this needed to be done.  No respect and poor planning.  Very 
dangerous combination.  And I'm tired of it .  It is quickly approaching the 
time to find a new profession.  

OK- enough venting for this morning.  Sorry- I am sure I will be in a much 
better mood when I see you tonight

I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions 
on EOL ""Force Majeure"" language.  Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon 
Katy Plant and were wondering the ""Force Majeure"" ramifications of the the 
Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that 
instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language?  
Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool 
and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these 
pooling zones.  

I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this 
information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.

Subject: Friday State of the Union

Its been a crazy February!  So many things and PEOPLE to talk about and only 
one Friday State of the Union to cover it all.  Everyone just relax because 
its going to be a long one.  As Always, Brace Yourself.

Where to begin?  How about those Tigers?  They are on track to be the SEC 
West Basketball Champions.  Who would have thought it? Kristin, my younger 
sister who is a freshman, says LSU is like ""Spring Break Everyday!""  That's 
great!  I'm sure the students at Harvard say the same thing when their teams 
are on a winning streak.  Geaux Tigers!

Forget Engagements how about Shot-Gun Weddings!  I recently learned that, 
while making a weekend trip to New Orleans, my high school sweet heart, 
Sarah, got ""Tanked"" in the French Quarter and found herself in the middle of 
the Pat O Brian's  Piano Bar in front of a minister saying ""I DO"" to her 
boyfriend, now husband, Brandt.  On such short notice, they were unable to 
find a reception hall to celebrate the wedding, so the family just celebrated 
all night at Dante's Pizza.  I hear it was one hell of a party.  
Congratulations Sarah!

Speaking of good parties, the DC Mardi Gras Balls were incredible.  I'd like 
to take this time to once again thank my buddy, Chris, for taking me and 
Kenny K with him.  If you enjoy Politics like I do, its a must see event.  
The two things that stick mostly in my mind are:  The last night of the ball 
after several cocktails, Granola Centola staggering over to Senator Mary 
Landrieu and saying,""Mrs. Clinton, will you dance with me to New Orleans 
Lady?""  That Larry, he's paving the path for his political future------a 
regular James Carville!  I also had the opportunity to ask the ever-so-shy 
Edwin Edwards a question - ""Governor who do you like in the President's 
Race?""  He responded, ""Have the odds come out already?!?""  No doubt a man of 
true character.

I hear times are tough for my friends down in Shreveport.  Brandon, a full 
time med school student, has been moonlighting during his free time.  He 
decided to put his ""Three on the top, two on the sides, don't touch the back, 
Jack, haircut "" to work on the Internet.  He's currently modelling his sweet 
hair style as ""Mullet of the Week""  at http://www.mulletsgalore.com/ .  He 
gets 50 cents every time the site is hit, so take the time and visit the site 
to help an aspiring doctor.

February was a good month and things are pretty good at the homefront.  I 
still haven't found the girl of my dreams, but neither has my roommate, 
Matt.  Although the chances of him finding one before me are pretty good 
considering all he's looking for is, and I quote, ""A girl who is pretty and 
who thinks I am smart just because I read the newspaper.""   
ICE---ICE---BABY---TOO COLD---TOO COLD!

Everyone have a great weekend!

CKL

Subject: Re: Friday State of the Union  

hey everyone it is you lucky day!  i forgot to put a few things into my 
famous friday state of the union.  first, i have picked up cooking recently.  
i am a regular emeril.  for my roommate matt's b-day i decided to make him an 
ice cream cake.  it looked so delicious.  i used cookie dough ice cream with 
an oreo cookies crust and whip cream.  for flavor i added two sticks of 
butter (the recipe calls for zero).  it looked so good that i ate it all 
before matt got home.  lucky for me matt came home in time to give me the 
hymlec's because i was choking to death on a stick of butter.  i am 
dissapointed though because i spilled ice cream all over my shirt and matt's 
carpet.  if anyone needs the recipe please call.

i did have a date this week with some girl (we will call her X).  we went to 
dinner and had appetizers, main course, desert and wine.  well, i had wine.  
we then went to my favorite bar.  i got a little buzzed so i let her drive my 
car.  X got made because i took a nap on the way home and she had to potato 
sack me into the house.  why do they call it ""landry loaded""?

i have been working out lately.  my friends still like to call me dough boy.  
i think they are jealous that i am so carved up.  god i am tan!

keep in touch

ckl 

ps-  please foward to our friends not on the distribution who would love to 
read my state of the union

When travelling to the U.K. with your hair dryer, electric shaver,  etc., 
don't forget to buy an adapter to fit in the U.K. sockets  before you leave 
home - or at latest in the airport upon arrival.  You are unlikely to find

Could you find some time to look at the new Southern Union contract for

Keep up the fight!
The walls are closing in on Vice President Al Gore. Both
the U.S. Supreme Court and the Leon County Circuit
Court in Florida ruled against Al Gore in two separate legal
battles.  First, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the
Florida Supreme Court had no legal justification for
extending the deadline for manual recounts.  The full text
of the Supreme Court decision is posted on our website at
http://www.electionintegrity.com/home/A363.cfm

The second blow to Gore came when Leon County Circuit
Court Judge N. Sanders Sauls ruled against his plea to
further extend the manual recounts.

Here's what Judge Sauls had to say:

""In order to contest election results . . . the plaintiff
must show that but for the irregularity or inaccuracy claim,
the result of the election would have been different and he
or she would have been the winner,"" said Sauls. ""In this
case, there is no credible statistical evidence ...that the
results of the statewide election in in the state of Florida
would be different from the results certified by the election
canvassing board.""

In the aftermath of these latest decisions, Mr. Gore has two
choices: drag on the fight to overturn the election in a
vain attempt to  discredit George W. Bush's legitimacy as
President-elect -- or, for the good of the people, concede.


As you know, Election Integrity is collecting online letters
to Al Gore urging him to concede.  Over 220,000 Americans
have signed in less than a week.   If you haven't already --
please go to our site and do it now.

We are so close to the end of this mess.  Let's keep up the
pressure.  PLEASE forward this message to your friends and
family and ask them to urge Al Gore to do the right thing
for our country -- CONCEDE.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

Subject: CP&L Requests - Jan '00

Eric;

Two requests for the current Central Power & Light contract 96022030 - Sitara 
Deal 92399:

1.  For January 2000 volumes, we need a deficiency charge added in the amount 
of 12,231.85.

2.  For the entire length / term of this deal, the second step of the tiers 
or NNQ should have the rate handle associated with Gas Daily Houston Ship 
Channel HIGH for the day delivered less one cent.   This is per the 
confirmation Contract Price item 2.  The dollar impact for the incorrect use 
of the MID rate for Jan '00 is 6,395.23.  This same change in the rate handle 
should be made retroactively to November '99 and proactively through October 
'00.

Total dollar impact for January '00 = 18,627.08  added revenue.

Attached is the Jan worksheet.  Questions or comments, please let me know.

had
me running through the house at break-neck speed, laughing my head off the

        Winning the Cultural War by Charlton Heston
   Date:
        Tue, 16 Mar 1999 20:47:56 -0600

Note from Bill Koenig:

Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard.
Rush Limbaugh today said he has received 9000 e-mail requests for a
copy.

It is entitled 'Winning the Cultural War' and was given at the
Harvard Law School Forum, February 16, 1999.

************

I remember my son when he was 5, explaining to his kindergarten
class what his father did for a living. ""My Daddy,"" he said,
""pretends to be people."" There have been quite a few of them.
Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple of
Christian saints, generals of various nationalities and different
centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the
ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lot
of different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them gets
to talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.

As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave me
the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those
great men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you
with your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom of
thought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating the
memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, ""We are
now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long
endure."" Those words are true again. I believe that we are again
engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about to
hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.
I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside
you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into
the miracle that it is.

Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National
Rifle Association, which protects the right to keep and
bear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I
serve as a moving target for the media who've called me
everything from ""ridiculous"" and ""duped"" to a ""brain-injured,
senile, crazy old man."" I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I sure
thank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of
those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that
firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than
that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across
our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable
thoughts and speech are mandated.

For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --
long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an
audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride
or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.

I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But
when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no
further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.

I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a
speech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews
and singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.

Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my
country. But when I asked an audience to oppose this
cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.

>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially
saying, ""Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are
using language not authorized for public consumption!""

But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political
correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the

British crown.

In his book, ""The End of Sanity,"" Martin Gross writes that
""blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the
norm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new
customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly
foisted on us from every direction.

Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,
without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind
mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right
from wrong. And they don't like it.""

Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men
seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each
step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...
all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In New
Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had
been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the
state commissioner announced that health providers who are
HIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients that
they are infected.

At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the
school team ""The Tribe"" because it was supposedly insulting
to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs
truly like the name.

In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the
rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for
transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing
sex change surgery.

In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been
placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in
Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At the
University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died
at Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college
officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.
Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said ""Negroes.""
Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said ""black."" But it's a
no-no now.

For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly
""Native-American."" I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I also
happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On
my wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American
... with a capital letter on ""American."" Finally, just last month
... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of Public
Advocate, used the word ""niggardly"" while talking to colleagues
about budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy or
scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and
resign.

As columnist Tony Snow wrote: ""David Howard got fired because some
people in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning
of 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover
the meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for their
ignorance."" What does all of this mean? It means that telling us
what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling
us what to do can't be far behind.

Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did
political correctness originate on America's campuses?
And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed
to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?

Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they
really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare
you too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the
halls of reason.

You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle
of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the
Charles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your
counterparts across the land, are the most socially
conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.

And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by
your grandfathers' standards-cowards.

Here's another example. Right now at more than one major
university, Second Amendment scholars and researchers are
being told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose their
jobs. Why? Because their research findings would undermine
big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of
millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.

I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked
at that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw
material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core
value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought
and expression lay down your arms and plead, ""Don't shoot me."" If
you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you
see distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a
sexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does not
make you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate
homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.

Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators
for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?
How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?

The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,
standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand
people. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of
course. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or
what to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol
that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.

I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who
learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great
man who led those in the right against those with the might.

Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that
Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent
Thoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that
protested a war in Vietnam.

In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural
correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, social
directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.

But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put
yourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You must
be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent
of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma.
You must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not Complaining,
but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me.
Let me tell you a story.

A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling
a CD called ""Cop Killer"" celebrating ambushing and
murdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other than
Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.
Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one
had been murdered. But Time/Warner was
stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media
were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.

I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly
Hills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.
What I did there was against the advice of my family and
colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a
thousand average American stockholders, I simply read the full
lyrics of ""Cop Killer""-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.

""I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF
I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF
I'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF
I'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF...""

It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But
trust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched
faces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and
stared at their shoes. They hated me for that.

Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist
filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old
nieces of Al and Tipper Gore. ""SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ....""

Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I
left the room in echoing silence.

When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said
""We can't print that."" ""I know,"" I replied, ""but Time/Warner _s
selling it.""

Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll
never be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from
Time magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,
not just talk.

When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam
the switchboard of the district attorney's office. When your
university is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of the
students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of
regents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the
playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment
...march on that school and block its doorways.

When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays
you ... petition them, oust them, banish them. When
Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy
Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott
their magazine and the products it advertises.

So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the
hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that
freed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the
hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by
God's grace, built this country.

If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.

Thank you.

Note from Bill Koenig:

Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard.
Rush Limbaugh today said he has received 9000 e-mail requests for a
copy.

It is entitled 'Winning the Cultural War' and was given at the
Harvard Law School Forum, February 16, 1999.

************

I remember my son when he was 5, explaining to his kindergarten
class what his father did for a living. ""My Daddy,"" he said,
""pretends to be people."" There have been quite a few of them.
Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple of
Christian saints, generals of various nationalities and different
centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the
ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lot
of different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them gets
to talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.

As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave me
the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those
great men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you
with your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom of
thought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating the
memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, ""We are
now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long
endure."" Those words are true again. I believe that we are again
engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about to
hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.
I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside
you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into
the miracle that it is.

Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National
Rifle Association, which protects the right to keep and
bear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I
serve as a moving target for the media who've called me
everything from ""ridiculous"" and ""duped"" to a ""brain-injured,
senile, crazy old man."" I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I sure
thank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of
those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that
firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than
that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across
our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable
thoughts and speech are mandated.

For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --
long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an
audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride
or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.

I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But
when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no
further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.

I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a
speech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews
and singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.

Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my
country. But when I asked an audience to oppose this
cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.

>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially
saying, ""Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are
using language not authorized for public consumption!""

But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political
correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the

British crown.

In his book, ""The End of Sanity,"" Martin Gross writes that
""blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the
norm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new
customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly
foisted on us from every direction.

Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,
without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind
mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right
from wrong. And they don't like it.""

Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men
seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each
step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...
all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In New
Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had
been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the
state commissioner announced that health providers who are
HIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients that
they are infected.

At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the
school team ""The Tribe"" because it was supposedly insulting
to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs
truly like the name.

In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the
rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for
transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing
sex change surgery.

In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been
placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in
Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At the
University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died
at Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college
officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.
Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said ""Negroes.""
Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said ""black."" But it's a
no-no now.

For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly
""Native-American."" I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I also
happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On
my wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American
... with a capital letter on ""American."" Finally, just last month
... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of Public
Advocate, used the word ""niggardly"" while talking to colleagues
about budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy or
scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and
resign.

As columnist Tony Snow wrote: ""David Howard got fired because some
people in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning
of 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover
the meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for their
ignorance."" What does all of this mean? It means that telling us
what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling
us what to do can't be far behind.

Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did
political correctness originate on America's campuses?
And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed
to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?

Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they
really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare
you too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the
halls of reason.

You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle
of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the
Charles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your
counterparts across the land, are the most socially
conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.

And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by
your grandfathers' standards-cowards.

Here's another example. Right now at more than one major
university, Second Amendment scholars and researchers are
being told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose their
jobs. Why? Because their research findings would undermine
big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of
millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.

I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked
at that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw
material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core
value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought
and expression lay down your arms and plead, ""Don't shoot me."" If
you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you
see distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a
sexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does not
make you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate
homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.

Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators
for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?
How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?

The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,
standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand
people. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of
course. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or
what to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol
that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.

I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who
learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great
man who led those in the right against those with the might.

Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that
Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent
Thoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that
protested a war in Vietnam.

In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural
correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, social
directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.

But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put
yourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You must
be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent
of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma.
You must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not Complaining,
but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me.
Let me tell you a story.

A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling
a CD called ""Cop Killer"" celebrating ambushing and
murdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other than
Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.
Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one
had been murdered. But Time/Warner was
stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media
were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.

I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly
Hills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.
What I did there was against the advice of my family and
colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a
thousand average American stockholders, I simply read the full
lyrics of ""Cop Killer""-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.

""I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF
I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF
I'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF
I'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF...""

It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But
trust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched
faces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and
stared at their shoes. They hated me for that.

Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist
filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old
nieces of Al and Tipper Gore. ""SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ....""

Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I
left the room in echoing silence.

When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said
""We can't print that."" ""I know,"" I replied, ""but Time/Warner _s
selling it.""

Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll
never be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from
Time magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,
not just talk.

When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam
the switchboard of the district attorney's office. When your
university is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of the
students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of
regents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the
playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment
...march on that school and block its doorways.

When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays
you ... petition them, oust them, banish them. When
Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy
Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott
their magazine and the products it advertises.

So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the
hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that
freed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the
hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by
God's grace, built this country.

If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.

Thank you.

Subject:
        Winning the Cultural War by Charlton Heston

Note from Bill Koenig:

Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard.
Rush Limbaugh today said he has received 9000 e-mail requests for a
copy.

It is entitled 'Winning the Cultural War' and was given at the
Harvard Law School Forum, February 16, 1999.

************

I remember my son when he was 5, explaining to his kindergarten
class what his father did for a living. ""My Daddy,"" he said,
""pretends to be people."" There have been quite a few of them.
Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple of
Christian saints, generals of various nationalities and different
centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the
ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lot
of different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them gets
to talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.

As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave me
the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those
great men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you
with your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom of
thought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating the
memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, ""We are
now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long
endure."" Those words are true again. I believe that we are again
engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about to
hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.
I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside
you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into
the miracle that it is.

Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National
Rifle Association, which protects the right to keep and
bear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I
serve as a moving target for the media who've called me
everything from ""ridiculous"" and ""duped"" to a ""brain-injured,
senile, crazy old man."" I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I sure
thank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of
those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that
firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than
that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across
our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable
thoughts and speech are mandated.

For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --
long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an
audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride
or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.

I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But
when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no
further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.

I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a
speech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews
and singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.

Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my
country. But when I asked an audience to oppose this
cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.

>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially
saying, ""Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are
using language not authorized for public consumption!""

But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political
correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the

British crown.

In his book, ""The End of Sanity,"" Martin Gross writes that
""blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the
norm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new
customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly
foisted on us from every direction.

Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,
without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind
mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right
from wrong. And they don't like it.""

Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men
seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each
step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...
all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In New
Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had
been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the
state commissioner announced that health providers who are
HIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients that
they are infected.

At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the
school team ""The Tribe"" because it was supposedly insulting
to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs
truly like the name.

In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the
rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for
transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing
sex change surgery.

In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been
placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in
Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At the
University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died
at Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college
officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.
Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said ""Negroes.""
Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said ""black."" But it's a
no-no now.

For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly
""Native-American."" I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I also
happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On
my wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American
... with a capital letter on ""American."" Finally, just last month
... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of Public
Advocate, used the word ""niggardly"" while talking to colleagues
about budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy or
scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and
resign.

As columnist Tony Snow wrote: ""David Howard got fired because some
people in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning
of 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover
the meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for their
ignorance."" What does all of this mean? It means that telling us
what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling
us what to do can't be far behind.

Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did
political correctness originate on America's campuses?
And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed
to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?

Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they
really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare
you too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the
halls of reason.

You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle
of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the
Charles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your
counterparts across the land, are the most socially
conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.

And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by
your grandfathers' standards-cowards.

Here's another example. Right now at more than one major
university, Second Amendment scholars and researchers are
being told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose their
jobs. Why? Because their research findings would undermine
big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of
millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.

I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked
at that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw
material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core
value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought
and expression lay down your arms and plead, ""Don't shoot me."" If
you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you
see distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a
sexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does not
make you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate
homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.

Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators
for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?
How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?

The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,
standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand
people. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of
course. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or
what to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol
that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.

I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who
learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great
man who led those in the right against those with the might.

Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that
Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent
Thoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that
protested a war in Vietnam.

In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural
correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, social
directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.

But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put

P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We 
thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to 
offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore,

You are all cordially invited to attend the following engagement.  Please 
bring friends and forward this to anyone I may have missed accidentally.

When: Saturday, January 29th-NEXT WEEKEND, not this Weekend.. no one will be 
there!

What:  6th annual John, Robert & Mo's Party (just 5th annual for me).  2kegs, 
assorted mixed beverages, and mystery snacks will be on hand.

Where: 6422 Wister Ln, 77008 713-869-6312, map below.

Time: Whenever till Whenever.

Why:  Why not.

Here is a friendly disclaimer from one of our hosts:

You all know what this is about! Let's set aside this evening to hearken back 
to our younger days... when peer pressure was still cool. Experienced 
IDHAFR's can attest, this is no ""Company Cocktail Buffet"". IDHAFR newbies 
will just have to take our word for it. Last year I said, ""we'll see what new 
lows we can achieve""... Little did I know!!!!!  Dolls in the freezer, RIVER 
DANCING... ON THE FURNITURE (picture my head held in shame). I will make no 
such prediction this year. I can't even promise that there will be a Man in 
Black. But I can promise you'll be sorry you missed it!

We hope this notice finds everyone in good health and spirits this new 
millennium (actually that's still a year away but...) So mark your calendar: 
(Out of town guests are surely welcome, sleeping (?) arrangements can always 
be found. Although I must say I didn't like having to share the space under 
the pool table in '96!)

You will probably have to park far away.  Neighbors are pretty friendly.

Stephanie, 

The deal ticket that Eric mentions below that changed the tiered pricing is 
EW5406.1 (which fixes the price to $2.35 from 6/1/99-9/30/99).

I was wondering if you showed price adjustments to June-August, in addition 
to September (since this ticket affects all months). 

Let me know, and then I'll call Laurie Clarkson with Cabot Oil & Gas and ask 
her to run this past her trader (Kent Beard) and make sure we are all on the 
same page.

Eric, 

Can you please help per Stephanie's note below.  The audit record shows that 
you changed the tiered pricing on this Cabot deal for 9/99.  Both Stephanie 
and myself thought that Cabot and HPL were in agreement on these prices for 
September.  Can you provide insight into why the tiers were changed for this 
month?

Melissa, 

Someone has changed one of the price tiers on Cabot for 9/99 production.  Due 
to the price change, it is now showing that I need to take a credit of $ 
52,996.72 from Cabot.  Is this correct or not????  I thought we had figured 
the pricing out for 9/99 and Cabot had also agreed.  Please let me know if 
the price change is correct or not, and if I need to take this credit from 
Cabot.  See below the change that was made in Sitara and I am also showing 
what we paid versus what is now showing up in the system.

Eric, 

Can you please help per Stephanie's note below.  The audit record shows that 
you changed the tiered pricing on this Cabot deal for 9/99.  Both Stephanie 
and myself thought that Cabot and HPL were in agreement on these prices for 
September.  Can you provide insight into why the tiers were changed for this 
month?

Thank you,

Melissa, 

Someone has changed one of the price tiers on Cabot for 9/99 production.  Due 
to the price change, it is now showing that I need to take a credit of $ 
52,996.72 from Cabot.  Is this correct or not????  I thought we had figured 
the pricing out for 9/99 and Cabot had also agreed.  Please let me know if 
the price change is correct or not, and if I need to take this credit from 
Cabot.  See below the change that was made in Sitara and I am also showing 
what we paid versus what is now showing up in the system.

15354,bass-e/all_documents/163.,<14538914.1075854577597.JavaMail.evans@thyme>," Tipper Gore, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered
 that her husband's great-great uncle, Gunther Gore, a fellow
 lacking in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train
 robbery in Tennessee in 1889.

 The only known photograph of Gunther shows him standing
 on the gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription:
 ""Gunther Gore; horse thief, sent to Tennessee Prison 1885,
 escaped 1887, robbed the Tennessee Flyer six times. Caught
 by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.""

 After letting Al Gore and his staff of professional image
 consultants peruse the findings, they decided to crop Gunther's
 picture, scan it in as an enlarged image, and edited it with
 image processing software so that all that's seen is a head shot.

 The accompanying biographical sketch was sent to the
 Associated Press as follows:

 ""Gunther Gore was a famous
 rancher in early Tennessee history. His business empire
 grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets
 and intimate dealings with the Tennessee railroad.
 Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to
 service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume
 his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in
 a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective
 Agency. In 1889, Gunther passed away during an important
 civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which
 he was standing, collapsed.""

 On deal 117413 for Dec 99, could you change the first tier from 750,000 to

Subject: Re: Entex Transport Reimbursement

Bass, is this accurate?

Ed asked me to find revenue from Entex for transportation expense to 
Lufkin/Diboll for the residential part of the contract (Transaction 10).  
After checking into it, we have all found the following things:

1. Howard allocates the Lufkin/Diboll meters (7107/8/9) based on actuals.
2. Howard receives allocations from Entex for the industrial volumes, and 
then backs into the Transaction 10 (residential) volumes for Lufkin/Diboll.
3. Howard allocates the residential piece for Lufkin/Diboll to Transaction 10.
4. Kyle bills Entex for the residential volume, and applies the cash to the 
sales invoice.
5. Cassandra cuts an invoice to Co. 16 to get reimbursed for the transport 
expense going up to Lufkin/Diboll for the residential volume.
6. Eric tells Mick how much expense Tom is including in his P&L for this 
transportation, and Mick includes it in Ed's P&L as revenue from the 
Marketing   Desk.
7. Phillip does manual G/L entries to show an expense to Tom and a revenue to 
Ed for the same amount .
8. This revenue shows up en masse with all of the other revenue from the 
marketing desk in Ed's P&L.

The total revenue for Ed for this portion is about $6,000 per month.  Eric 
says, too, that Ed shows revenue during the winter months for transport for 
Entex of about $200,000 per month from the marketing desk.  This comes from 
money reserved to manage the Entex deal.

Subject: Entex Transport Reimbursement

Eric and Mick, does this match your understanding of how the money for 
transport related to the volumes that Entex pulls for Lufkin/Diboll 
residential volumes end up in Ed's P&L?  Also, do we do anything for the 
industrial volume?  I think we ought to let people know that we accomplished 
this (albeit that we did this a long time ago).  Please let me know.

Ed asked me to find revenue from Entex for transportation expense to 
Lufkin/Diboll for the residential part of the contract (Transaction 10).  
After checking into it, we have all found the following things:

1. Howard allocates the Lufkin/Diboll meters (7107/8/9) based on actuals.

5. Cassandra cuts an invoice to Co. 16 to get reimbursed for the transport 
expense going up to Lufkin/Diboll for the residential volume.
6. The money lands in Ed's P&L for the residential piece of the transport 
reimbursement.

Right now, at the end of the month, Eric Bass tells Mick how much the 
transport reimbursement is and Mick includes that money in Ed's P&L as 
revenue from a third party.  The actual money is reflected in Co. 12, and we 
just have to make sure that the money is reflected as revenue for Ed in the 
G/L rather than for Tom.

Subject: Reliant Energy - Entex Transport Imbalance


Howard,
This memo is regarding the 91,297 MMBtu imbalance that was created in April 
of 1999 on 
transport contract #012-41991-02-004. The transport delivery off HPLC was 
shorted to keep
Entex whole on a minimum purchase from ENA. Originally this transport 
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in May of 1999. Some of the imbalance was cleared in May of 
1999, but 91,297 MMBtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract. We need to monitor the IFHSC 
Index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the IFHSC Index of April of 1999 we can 
clear this imbalance. We will
need to allocated 91,297 MMBtu extra to the transport. This will reduce the 
purchase from ENA by 91,297 
MMBtu for that month.  I need you to watch over whoever is doing the Reliant 
Energy - Entex allocation to 
make sure this happens.


Thanks,
Michael

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Marshall is suffering from a knee injury and is questionable for Tuesday's=
=20
game against the Raptors.  David Benoit will get extended playing time if=
=20
Marshall is unable to play.   =20

 Vin Baker , F SEA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/04/00=20
 Baker sat out Sunday's game against the Warriors due to a knee injury. =20
Jelani McCoy and Rashard Lewis got extended playing time in his absence. =
=20
Look for that to continue until Baker returns.  For now he is listed as=20
questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Detroit.   =20

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Sabonis missed Sunday's game at Phoenix due to a sore knee.  He has now=20
missed three games in a row and is questionable for Wednesday's game at=20
Toronto.  When Sabonis finally returns look for him to come off the bench f=
or=20
a few games before returning to his job as the starting center.  Dale Davis=
=20
will start at the pivot until then.  =20

 Hubert Davis , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Davis missed his third straight game Sunday due to a strained groin. =20
Courtney Alexander replaced him at shooting guard.  Davis is questionable f=
or=20
Tuesday's game at Houston.  When he finally does return to the lineup he ma=
y=20
find that Greg Buckner or Michael Finley has replaced him at the two-spot. =
  =20

 Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Nash sat out Sunday's game against the Lakers because of a bruised calf. =
=20
The Mavericks went with a backcourt of Howard Eisley and rookie Courtney=20
Alexander in his absence.  Nash is questionable for Tuesday's game at=20
Houston.   =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Buckner played for the Mavericks Sunday after missing seven straight games=
=20
prior to that with a sprained foot.   It will take him a while but Buckner=
=20
will become a productive Fantasy player again in a few weeks, if he is stil=
l=20
healthy.     =20

 Chris Mullin , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Mullin is still suffering from a sore knee and missed his fifth consecutiv=
e=20
game Sunday.  If you have Mullin on your team hoping for a miracle Fantasy=
=20
season, it's time to let go.  It appears that Mullin won't be well enough t=
o=20
help a Fantasy team this season.    =20

 Chris Porter , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 With Chris Mullin and Chris Mills sidelined, Porter got the first start of=
=20
his career Sunday, playing small forward.  He responded by scoring 18 point=
s=20
and grabbing six rebounds.  Look out for Porter.  He is extremely athletic=
=20
and could develop into a surprise Fantasy star in the upcoming weeks.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00=20
 Carter is listed as day-to-day with a sore left knee, but will accompany t=
he=20
team on its three-game road trip. Head Coach Lenny Wilkens said that Carter=
's=20
availability for the trip won't be determined until Tuesday. It may be a go=
od=20
idea to sit Carter this week until his return date is a bit more clear.    =
=20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/04/00=20
 The Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to practice with t=
he=20
team on Monday and may be available to play against the Celtics on Tuesday=
=20
night.  If Hill's injured ankle is still tender, however, he will likely wa=
it=20
until Orlando's West Coast road trip next week before returning. Fantasy=20
owners who have been waiting for Hill's return should keep him on the bench=
=20
until he has been cleared to play by the team.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Gill, who is currently stuck in a horrendous shooting slump, may find=20
himself either on the bench or being placed on the injured list. Gill has=
=20
been bothered by tendinitis in his right knee, which has made him feel like=
=20
he is ""playing on one leg.""  Fantasy owners who were expecting Gill to be=
=20
productive should seriously consider benching him until he is healthy enoug=
h=20
to perform at a higher level. =20

 Fred Hoiberg , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Hoiberg is less optimistic that he will be able to play against the=20
Timberwolves on Tuesday after testing his sore left ankle in a workout on=
=20
Saturday.  He is listed as day to day, and hopes to return for Chicago's=20
weekend road trip through Texas. Hoiberg, like many of his Chicago teammate=
s,=20
holds very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00=20
 Brand missed practice on Sunday after sustaining a left knee hyperextensio=
n=20
at the end of Friday night's loss to the Knicks. He will have an MRI=20
performed on Monday and is listed as questionable for Tuesday's game agains=
t=20
Minnesota. Brand leads the Bulls in scoring (18.8 ppg) and rebounding (10.4=
=20
rpg), and is one of the top forwards in the world of Fantasy.  Owners may=
=20
want to put Brand on their bench this week until the extent of his injury h=
as=20
been determined.  =20

 Chris Herren , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Herren has been placed on the injured list because of his sore shoulder, b=
ut=20
remains optimistic that he can return soon. ""I'm going to rest it a bit and=
=20
see how it goes,"" said Herren. If the injury persists, surgery may be his=
=20
next option. Herren isn't a very value Fantasy player, so his injury won't=
=20
effect most owners.   =20

 Mitch Richmond , G WAS - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00=20
 Richmond injured his right knee in Saturday's game against Miami, and didn=
't=20
make the trip to Detroit for Sunday's game with the Pistons. He will have a=
n=20
MRI done on Monday to determine the extent of the injury.  If you have=20
Richmond on your Fantasy roster, it may be a good idea to keep him on the=
=20
bench this week. =20

 Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 The Washington Wizards, who traded Ekezie to the Clippers last week, have=
=20
picked him up off of waivers. Ekezie, who was released by the Clippers=20
shortly after the trade, had averaged 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in his=20
first stint with Washington.  He holds no Fantasy value.  =20

 Glenn Robinson , F MIL - The Old School Fools Updated 12/04/00=20
 Robinson, one of three starters who began the game on the bench for missin=
g=20
a pregame meeting, scored 24 points as Milwaukee beat the Indiana Pacers=20
92-80 Sunday. Bucks coach George Karl kept Robinson, fellow forward Jason=
=20
Caffey and point guard Sam Cassell out of the starting lineup one day after=
=20
criticizing his team for its dismal play in a loss at Atlanta.   Cassell,=
=20
Robinson and Caffey were replaced by Lindsey Hunter, Tim Thomas and Jerome=
=20
Kersey, respectively.   When Robinson entered the game after watching the=
=20
first eight minutes, he missed his first five shots before finding his=20
touch.   =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/03/00=20
 Oakley was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000 by the=
=20
NBA on Friday for punching Los Angeles Clippers guard Jeff McInnis during t=
he=20
morning shootaround.   He sat out Friday night's game against the Clippers,=
=20
and also will miss games in Utah on Tuesday and Portland on Wednesday.    =
=20

 Scott Williams , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Milwaukee Bucks activated Williams from the injured list. Williams wen=
t=20
on the injured list November 17 with lower back spasms. He had been startin=
g=20
at center until his injury but came off the bench Saturday, grabbing four=
=20
rebounds in six scoreless minutes of a 101-94 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. To=
=20
make room for Williams, the Bucks placed rookie guard Michael Redd on the=
=20
injured list.  =20

 Jake Voskuhl , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Chicago Bulls activated Voskuhl on Friday and placed rookie guard A.J.=
=20
Guyton on the injured list with a sprained right knee.   =20

 Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Minnesota Timberwolves activated Hammonds from the injured list.  =20
Hammonds had been sidelined for the entire season with soreness in both=20
ankles. To make room for Hammonds, the Timberwolves placed forward Reggie=
=20
Slater on the injured list with tendinitis in his right knee.   =20

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 MacCulloch was activated Friday by the Philadelphia 76ers and Pepe Sanchez=
=20
was placed on the injured list with bursitis in the left hip.   MacCulloch=
=20
was placed on the injured list Nov. 20 with tendinitis in his left ankle.  =
 =20

 Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Cleveland Cavaliers activated Knight from the injured list Friday. The=
=20
point guard had knee surgery Aug. 17. Cleveland also placed guard Michael=
=20
Hawkins on the injured list because of a sprained left ankle.  =20

 Bonzi Wells , G POR - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00=20
 Wells was suspended for Thursday night's game against Dallas and fined=20
$10,000 by the NBA for intentionally striking and verbally abusing an=20
official.   He will be back in the lineup for Saturday's game at Houston.  =
 =20

 A.J. Guyton , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00=20
 Guyton sprained his right knee during the first quarter of Thursday night'=
s=20
game against Chicago. He will undergo an MRI on Friday, and will likely mis=
s=20
a few games due to the injury. Guyton is of no value in the world of Fantas=
y.=20
=20

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00=20
 Interim head coach Nate McMillan has inserted Davis into the starting line=
up=20
at guard in place of Ruben Patterson.  This move was made more to improve t=
he=20
ballhandling and defense in the backcourt than for offense.  Davis will tak=
e=20
some of the pressure off Gary Payton in running the plays but he won't be o=
f=20
much help to Fantasy teams.   =20

 Vin Baker , F SEA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/01/00=20
 New coach Nate McMillan has made numerous roster changes since taking over=
=20
as interim head coach one of them has involved Baker.  McMillan has replace=
d=20
Baker in the starting lineup with F/C Jelani McCoy.  The move could help to=
=20
motivate Baker in the long run.  He seemed fired up against the Lakers=20
Thursday scoring 20 points and grabbing nine rebounds.  But Baker must stil=
l=20
prove that he can be a consistent producer, put him on your bench until his=
=20
Fantasy production becomes more solid. =20

 Tyronn Lue , G LAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00=20
 The Lakers are considering offers for Lue.  He is currently on injured=20
reserve but the Sixers and the Magic have shown interest in him.  Lue could=
=20
develop into a somewhat valuable Fantasy player on either team where he wou=
ld=20
receive extended minutes as a backup.   =20

 Quentin Richardson , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00=20
 With Tyrone Nesby traded to Washington.  Richardson moved into the startin=
g=20
lineup at shooting guard Wednesday.  He scored 18 points and grabbed eight=
=20
rebounds.  Keep an eye on Richardson.  If he continues to perform like this=
=20
he will be a nice Fantasy acquisition.  =20

 Samaki Walker , F SA - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00=20
 Walker has been placed on the injured list due to a sprained left ankle. T=
he=20
ankle could affect Walker's numbers for awhile when he finally does return.=
=20
Although he has been somewhat productive, Walker comes off the bench and is=
=20
only valuable in deeper Fantasy leagues.   =20

Coping With Job Stress

  At a seminar called ""Stress and Disease""  by Dr. Nickolas Hall, an
expert in psychobiology, gave an example of a coping skill for job
stress which I would like to share with you.

  When you have had one of those ""Take This Job and Shove It"" days,
try this:

On your way home after work, stop at your pharmacy and go to the
section where they have thermometers. You will need to purchase
a rectal thermometer made by ""Q-tip"". BE SURE THAT YOU GET
THIS BRAND! When you get home, lock your doors, draw the drapes,
and disconnect the phone so you will not be disturbed during your
therapy.

Change to very comfortable clothing, such as a sweat suit, and lie
down on your bed. Open the package containing the thermometer,
remove the thermometer and carefully place it on the bedside table
so that it will not become chipped or broken.

Take the written material that accompanies the thermometer and as
you read it, you will notice in small print the statement that says,
""Every rectal thermometer made by Q-tip is PERSONALLY tested.""

Now.... close your eyes and say out loud five times, ""I am so glad that
I do not work in quality control at the Q-tip company.""

Please forward to your respective personnel.

There will be 2 demos of the New SITARA Risk Assignment release this Thursday 
(Jan 13) in room EB 2537 from 11:15-12:15, and 1:00-2:00.

There will be additional demos for the general SITARA population the

recommend you attempt to make one of the sessions this week.   We planning on 
rolling the new changes out the weekend of Jan 22.   These are some major 
changes that will effect every deal with risk assignment.

Please make every effort to attend.  

If you currently enter deals with risk assignment - hands on training can be 
arranged.  Also, we will be available to assist you as needed after 
implementation.

There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is 
the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.  This 
was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures (Entex takes were slightly 
higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).  Let me know if you have 
further questions.

Sorry I didn't get a chance to come by this weekend, mike lutanno's dad
passed away, so I was pretty busy keeping him company.  Other than that, not

Eric, Ami just booked two deals (#148251, #148253) on the BDOL pipe and since 
that pipe had never been used before we do not have that location mapped to 
any curves.  As a result those two deals have not bridged to CPR and will 
remain like this until you provide the necessary curve information listed 
below.  If you will need to create new curves and that will take a while, let 
me know if you want me to map this location to some existing curves in the 
meantime, so it will at least bridge to CPR.  Then, when you create your 
curves I can just re-map the location to the new curves.

There is currently only one zone on this pipe.

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving  Up?

QB Aaron Brooks  (NO)? We keep hyping the kid and he keeps delivering.? =20
Another outstanding game Sunday where he rolled up 441 yards and 2 TDs as h=
e =20
went 30 for 48.? The Saints rushing game is clearly struggling so it  appea=
rs=20
Brooks will continue to air the ball out.? Yes, he'll make some  young QB=
=20
mistakes and I'd be surprised if he didn't throw as many interceptions  as =
he=20
does TDs.? I expect him to throw a lot of both.? I almost  started him over=
=20
Peyton Manning in my local league but didn't pull the  trigger.? Manning wa=
s=20
solid but Brooks was better.

QB Kordell Stewart  (Pit)? Kordell made our upgrade list last week and here=
=20
he sits  again.? It took a few years, but he's showing folks that maybe 199=
7=20
was no  fluke.? He showed guts coming back in the game after being knocked=
=20
out with  a bad knee or calf (depending on whether you listen to coach Bill=
=20
Cowher or  Stewart)? The TD rush was highlight material.? His problem all=
=20
along  seems to have been confidence and he's surely brimming with it now.?=
=20
Kent  Graham was so bad I won't even mention him in the downgrades but he p=
ut=20
on a  horrid display when he was in the game.? He's  awful.

QB Jay Fiedler  (Mia)? Dan Fouts said on Monday Night Football a few weeks=
=20
ago  that a nice pass just thrown by Fiedler ""was as pretty as anything Dan=
=20
Marino  ever threw"".? Fiedler has those moments and he was having them fair=
ly=20
often  against the supposedly tough Bills where they were supposedly going =
to=20
have an  advantage in their cold weather.? Didn't play out that way.?=20
Fiedler  looks pretty darn good.

QB Jeff Garcia  (SF)? We had him high in week 14 like we have all year and=
=20
he  didn't disappoint.? WR Terrell Owens was a huge help and apparently=20
Jerry  Rice's wife?harping on the radio had some sort of positive effect.? =
=20
The Chargers had been very tough against the pass and Garcia shredded  them=
.

QB Brett Favre  (GB)? I have a hard time putting a finger on it but this gu=
y=20
just  does what it takes to get the job done.? He'd be much better off if W=
R =20
Antonio Freeman earned 10% of his paycheck but in the meantime, Bill=20
Schroeder's  doing a great job.?=20

QB Jeff George  (Was)? Lil Danny Snyder removed the primary obstacle to=20
keeping  his QB Jeff George off the field by firing Norv Turner Monday.?=20
George  looks to start this week and possibly for the rest of the year.?=20
Although  tying Snyder to anything past the next series is a stretch.? I'm =
a=20
Jeff  George fan though and he does give the team a big arm.? We'll see how=
=20
it  goes but at least it looks as if he'll get his shot.

?

RBs Moving  Up

RB Mike Anderson  (Den)? Like you need me to tell you this.? The fact that=
=20
he  ran buck wild on a tough New Orleans defense made the effort all the=20
more  impressive.? He bruised a knee but seemed to bounce back and looks to=
=20
be  good for Sunday.? Clearly, the Denver OL is the star on this team so if=
=20
you  own Anderson, it's probably not a bad idea to grab KaRon Coleman for t=
he=20
stretch  run.?=20

RB Fred Taylor  (Jac)? For all the early?ripping I've done to Taylor, he's =
=20
performed just as we predicted he would lately - like a madman.? You don't =
=20
need me to tell you he's been awesome.

RB Warrick Dunn  (TB)? Can the little guy take up the slack for Mike=20
Alstott??  I've got a couple hundred reasons that says ""yes"".? Ok, rushing=
=20
for 200+  against Dallas is nothing special (it's happened in 23% of the=20
Cowboys games  this year) but you have to admit Dunn looked great  Sunday.?

RB Corey Dillon  (Cin)? One can only salivate about what he might do if he=
=20
played  for a team like Denver.? The fact he can continue to roll up huge=
=20
yardage  on this team is amazing.? New QB Scott Mitchell is a huge boost as=
=20
he looks  like Peyton Manning back there compared to Akili  Smith...

RB Ahman Green  (GB)? Green's a guy that's finally living up to his =20
potential.? You always knew he had the physical skills but now he seems to =
=20
be catching up mentally as well.? He showed a nice nose for the endzone =20
Sunday with the 2 TDs.

RB Lamar Smith  (Mia)? So much for the cold weather hamstring worries.?=20
Smith  carried the load Sunday in frigid Buffalo and looked great.? It look=
s=20
to me  like he's picking up right where he left off.

RB Terrell Fletcher  (SD)? It's not exactly the same as earning the startin=
g=20
RB job in  Tennessee or Indianapolis, but Fletcher does seem to have nailed=
=20
down the #1 RB  slot in San Diego.? And that's worth something.? You have t=
o=20
decide  how much...

RB Fred Beasley  (SF)? We loved Beasley early in the season as he racked up=
 =20
TDs.? He got back in the mix Sunday with 5 carries and a TD.? The FB  for S=
an=20
Francisco has always been a valuable FF slot and Beasley might be worth  th=
e=20
roll of the dice if you're thin at RB.

RB Shawn Bryson  (Buf)? Finally, Bryson does something besides make me look=
=20
bad for  hyping him.? He rolled up 88 yards on just 12 attempts Sunday and=
=20
looks to  take advantage of Sammy Morris' ankle troubles.?=20

RB Terry Allen  (NO)? Allen made an appearance Sunday and with Jerald Moore=
=20
and  Chad Morton failing to astound anyone, Allen could get more looks.?=20
Whether  he's got anything left in the tank remains to be seen.

?

WRs Moving  Up

WR David Boston  (Ari)?? Boston turned in a huge game Sunday and has to be =
=20
considered an upgrade.? He's a streaky guy but with Frank Sanders a total =
=20
non factor, Boston is getting most of QB Jake Plummer's attention these =20
days.? And with Arizona almost certain to be playing from behind, he could =
=20
do some damage.

WR Darrell Jackson  (Sea)? Jackson was red hot several weeks ago but had=20
cooled of  late.? He warmed up again Sunday with Jon Kitna under center.?=
=20
It's  tough to depend on the Seahawk passing game but Jackson could be wort=
h=20
a  shot.

WR Curtis Conway  (SD)? Conway has benefited the most from the Ryan Leaf =
=20
resurgence.? He caught 7 passes Sunday and should benefit as Leaf continues=
 =20
to improve.

WR Willie Jackson  (NO)? Jackson's officially moved past the ""flash in the=
=20
pan"" stage  with another solid day.? Aaron Brooks continues to look good at=
=20
QB.?  Jackson may suffer a bit when Jake Reed gets healthy but for right no=
w,=20
he's  looking good.

WR Joe Horn  (NO)? Again, QB Aaron Brooks delivers and Horn is the prime =
=20
recipient.? Joe Horn is one of the better stories of 2000 and he should =20
continue to shine especially if the rushing game doesn't get  untracked.

WR Bobby Shaw  (Pit)? Shaw may still be available in your league as the=20
starting  WR opposite Hines Ward.? He found the endzone again and continues=
=20
to make  some noise with Kordell Stewart quarterbacking.

WR Terrell Owens  (SF)? The best news for Jeff Garcia owners had to be a=20
solid day  from Terrell Owens.? He's a huge boost to the offense when he ca=
n=20
go and it  looked like he'd made progress with the toe.? Keep an eye out fo=
r=20
how he  responds after the game but I liked what I saw.

WR Shockmain Davis  (NE)? Ok, I'll be honest.? I'm pretty much just includi=
ng=20
him  here because he's the owner of the coolest name in the  league...

?

TEs Moving  Up

TE Dwayne Carswell  (Den)? Carswell's finally starting to emerge as the TE =
of=20
choice  in Denver.? His 62 yards Sunday were second only to San Diego's=20
Freddie  Jones.? You have to worry about Desmond Clark stealing time but I'=
d=20
have no  trouble starting Carswell each week.

TE Reggie Kelly  (Atl)? One of the few bright spots for Atlanta has been th=
e=20
play  of Kelly.? He caught 4 passes for 44 yards Sunday with a TD.? New QB =
=20
Doug Johnson may lean on him as he settles in.

TE Mark Bruener  (Pit)? Bruener makes the list not only for having another=
=20
solid  game but for making one of the best TD runs after the catch Sunday a=
s=20
he piggy  backed a defender into the endzone after refusing to go down at t=
he=20
5 yard  line.

TE Andrew Glover  (NO)? Obviously, the play of Aaron Brooks raises the leve=
l=20
of play  for all the Saints receivers.? Glover made a couple of nice plays=
=20
Sunday  including a good looking TD catch.

?

Players Moving  Down

QBs Moving  Down

QB Shane Matthews  (Chi)? Take a seat Shane.? Cade McNown likely makes his =
=20
return.? Folks can hardly wait...

QB Troy Aikman  (Dal)? Emmitt Smith owners had to love it but did it seem=
=20
strange  to anyone else that the Cowboys felt the best way to come back fro=
m=20
a huge  deficit against Tampa was to feed the ball to Emmitt?? Clearly, the=
=20
team  has zero faith in Aikman's ability to throw the ball.

QB Shaun King  (TB)? I know he's had trouble with the back but 65 passing =
=20
yards?? That's a joke.? He'll be better but I've seen  enough.

QB Brad Johnson  (Was)? It's the Jeff George show.? At least until?George =
=20
looks bad for a few series...

QB Rob Johnson  (Buf)? In leagues that penalize for interceptions, you'd ha=
ve=20
been  better off starting yourself this weekend than you would've Rob=20
Johnson.?  Once again, he starts the game but finishes holding a  clipboard=
.

?

RBs?Moving  Down

RB Jamal Anderson  (Atl)? Anderson's not playing too badly but the team is=
=20
in  shambles.? After QB Chris Chandler was benched, Anderson vented some =
=20
frustrations saying for all he knew, ""he might be punting this week"".? I =
=20
don't think we'll see that but I also don't think we'll see the days of him=
 =20
seriously rushing the ball for the rest of the year.

RB Shaun Alexander  (Sea)?? RB Ricky Watters has proven to be less than an=
=20
ideal  playmate refusing to share the ball.? Actually, he's played so well=
=20
that  Mike Holmgren has been reluctant to do anything to disrupt the flow o=
f=20
his  star.? When the team is struggling as badly as it is, you don't mess=

Hello Everyone,

I hope that you all enjoyed the holidays, and I'd venture to say that most of 
you enjoyed it more than I did.  I did however have a great New Years.  It 
actually inspired this email.  On the 6 hour trip back to Houston from New 
Orleans yesterday Tim and I came to the conclusion that the analysts haven't 
gotten together in awhile and decided to arrange a gathering.  We were 
thinking about doing Texadelphia tonight for the Sugar Bowl.  It's located at 
6025 Westheimer (ph # 713-785-6700).  Also, I think we are going to do 
Woody's on Richmond Thursday night if anyone's interested.  Please let me 
know if you plan on attending.  I think we are going to head over there 
between 6:30 - 7:00.

Hope to see you all tonight!!

With the new Wellhead Portfolio, will Greg's Accrual income be readily

He is looking to have adjustments made to credit him accrual income for both 
the 3rd and 4th Quarters.  Will you be able to back into these numbers using 
this portfolio? 

If you have an estimate number of what the accrual value would be, just let

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Quinton Spotwood , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00 
 Spotwood was signed to the New York Giants' practice squad on Tuesday. He 
had been in both Dallas and Miami's camps during the season. Spotwood has no 
Fantasy value.   

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Alstott could be back in practice on Thursday, a full two weeks ahead of 
schedule in his return from a sprained knee. If all goes well, he could play 
in the Monday night game against St. Louis, or at worst, the season finale 
against Green Bay on December 24. It's probably best to keep Alstott on your 
bench during the Fantasy playoffs, although there's an outside shot he could 
make an impact during the final game if he gets into the swing of things 
quickly.  

 Chad Morton , RB NO - Fear Updated 12/12/00 
 Morton is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Atlanta with a 
separated shoulder, although he was able to play with a shoulder injury last 
Sunday. We don't recommend him for your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 Head Coach Jim Haslett says he hopes to re-sign Moore, who was placed on 
waivers on Saturday. Moore became expendable with the addition of veteran 
Terry Allen, and won't have any Fantasy value even if he returns.  

 Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Hatchette injured the oblique muscle above his hip during last Sunday's game 
against St. Louis. He's listed as day to day, but is expected to play Sunday 
against Green Bay. He's not someone who will help your Fantasy team much, 
though.  

 Chris Walsh , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Walsh is unlikely to play Sunday against Green Bay after he underwent 
surgery on Tuesday on a broken bone in his left cheek. He suffered the injury 
during last Sunday's game against St. Louis but finished the game. Walsh has 
been valuable to the Vikings on special teams and as the No. 4 receiver, but 
he's not a viable Fantasy option.  

 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/12/00 
 The Jaguars will need to evaluate Taylor's sprained left knee during 
practice this week before determining his status for Sunday's game against 
Cincinnati. He suffered the injury during the third quarter of last Sunday's 
game, which was his seventh straight with at least 100 rushing yards. 
Hopefully Taylor will be able to play, as he's among the best options at 
running back during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Northcutt will miss Cleveland's final game of the season Sunday against 
Tennessee due to a sprained ankle. Believe it or not, this likely hurts the 
Browns' quarterbacking situation most, as he was rotating in that slot last 
Sunday against Philadelphia. It's best to avoid any Cleveland players at this 
stage of the Fantasy season.  

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Enis, who missed last Sunday's game against New England due to a reaction to 
an over-the-counter flu medicine, was feeling better Monday. Still, his 
status for Sunday's game against San Francisco is unknown, so it's best to 
keep him on your bench this week.  

 Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bears Coach Dick Jauron may give Matthews the start at quarterback on Sunday 
against San Francisco, instead of giving Cade McNown the final two starts. 
One possible reason for that may be that Matthews aggravated an injury when 
he was rushed back last season, and Jauron didn't want the same to happen to 
McNown. We don't recommend either quarterback this week, despite him facing 
the weak Niners' pass defense.   

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00 
 Biakabutuka, who has missed four games with turf toe, may be able to 
practice on Wednesday. Even if he is able to play Sunday against San Diego, 
we wouldn't recommend Biakabutuka the remainder of the season.  

 Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Fear Updated 12/12/00 
 Although he's most likely the quarterback for 2001, Beuerlein might be 
benched for backup Jeff Lewis for part of Carolina's final two games. Nothing 
is worse than a part-time quarterback for your Fantasy playoffs, so steer 
clear of both players if at all possible.  

 Jeff Lewis , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Coach George Seifert says that he may give Lewis some playing time over the 
final two games, although he has endorsed Steve Beuerlein as the starter for 
2001. Lewis has a high cost against the cap, so the Panthers need to 
determine soon whether he's the quarterback of the future. On the other hand, 
Beuerlein has the third-longest consecutive-starts streak in the league at QB 
and may not want to end it. Lewis isn't someone we'd recommend during your 
Fantasy playoffs, whether he starts or not.  

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 German was unable to practice Monday, and may be placed on injured reserve 
on Tuesday with a badly sprained left ankle. He has no Fantasy value.  

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' defense has been ravaged by injuries this season, and it 
certainly showed on Monday night. Although Indianapolis did score two 
defensive touchdowns in the game, Buffalo's D still gave up 30 points to 
Indy. Once a solid defensive unit, the Bills are now just a shell of their 
former selves and shouldn't be considered a starting defensive squad on your 
Fantasy team.   

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Christie made up for his scoreless performance last week with two field 
goals on Monday night, including a 46-yard boot in the second quarter. He is 
one of the best placekickers in the league, and should be considered a weekly 
starter on your Fantasy team.   

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' young wideout has only 12 receptions in his last six games and 
hasn't seen the end zone since Week Three against the Jets. What little 
Fantasy value he may have had early in the season is all but gone now.   

 Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 Vanderjagt converted on all three of his field goal attempts in Monday 
night's win over Buffalo. He is one of the NFL's most accurate kickers, 
missing only two field goals the entire season. Starting Vanderjagt this week 
is a good idea against a tough Miami defesne that doesn't allow many 
touchdowns.   

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Pollard hasn't had more than two catches in any game in the last four weeks, 
and hasn't scored a touchdown since Week Five. Translation: Avoid starting 
Pollard at all costs for the duration of your Fantasy season.   

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/12/00 
 With only seven receptions in the last four weeks, including only one on 
Monday night, Dilger has become a Fantasy afterthought. Avoid starting him if 
your roster allows it.  

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Pathon caught three passes for 31 yards on Monday night against the Bills. 
At this point in the season, Pathon has no Fantasy value.   

 Eric Moulds , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 12/12/00 
 Moulds had another sub-par performance on Monday night, catching only two 
passes for 47 yards in the Bills' loss to Indianapolis. In the last two 
weeks, Moulds has caught only four balls for 58 yards and no touchdowns. 
Fantasy owners who have Moulds should continue starting him in the Fantasy 
playoffs and hope that he can break out of this semi-slump.    

 Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00 
 Wilkins came back down to earth after last week's 109-yard, one touchdown 
performance against the Jets, catching only two passes for 37 yards on Monday 
night. Wilkins has been far more effective on special teams than as a 
receiver in recent weeks, so don't expect much production in the final two 
weeks of the season.    

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Lie Downs Updated 12/12/00 
 To the disbelief of many Fantasy owners, Harrison was held in check in 
Monday night's game with the Bills. He caught only two passes for 27 yards 
against what was an injury-depleted Buffalo secondary - a performance which 
may have helped keep some owners from moving on in their playoffs. If you 
were lucky enough to advance, Harrison is still a must start, even against 
the Colts' next opponent, the Miami Dolphins. In the team's first meeting, 
Harrison scorched the Fish for 74 yards receiving and two scores.     

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00 
 Price had his best performance of the season on Monday night, catching four 
passes for 93 yards and a touchdown in Buffalo's loss to the Colts. These 
were the types of numbers that Fantasy owners were expecting all season from 
Price, but they are still too little, too late to consider him for your 
starting lineup.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 Morris returned to limited duty on Monday night after missing two games with 
an ankle injury. He accounted for 34 yards of total offense and a touchdown 
in the Bills' 44-20 loss. Morris will likely be splitting time with Shawn 
Bryson in the backfield, so it's a good idea to avoid starting either of 
Buffalo's tailbacks at this point.  

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 12/12/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries against the Colts on Monday night, 
rushing the ball 15 times for 45 yards.  His main production, however, came 
through the air, where he caught six passes for 75 yards. Bryson's 120 yards 
of total offense is impressive, but he still isn't a viable option for 
Fantasy owners at this point in the season.    

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 ""The Edge"" had a terrific Fantasy performance on Monday night, compiling 132 
yards of total offense and three touchdowns in the Colts' big win over 
Buffalo. James will face a Miami squad that gave up 118 yards rushing to him 
back in Week 12, but also kept him out of the end zone. When it comes really 
comes down to it, the Colts could be facing the 1985 Bears' defense and it 
wouldn't matter - James is a must start for the duration of the Fantasy 
playoffs.  

 Peyton Manning , QB IND - The Lie Downs Updated 12/12/00 
 Manning had a very un-Peyton like performance on Monday night, completing 
13-of-24 passes for only 132 yards and no touchdowns in the Colts' 44-20 win. 
It was the first time this season that Manning was held with out at least one 
touchdown pass in a game. If your team survived Manning's poor Fantasy 
performance, you may not like his team's next opponent - Miami. The Dolphins 
have two of the best corners in the game in Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison, 
so it isn't out of the question for Manning to have another sub-par 
performance. At this point in the season, it is a good idea to stick with the 
former Vols star and hope he can have a more typical Peyton Manning day.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Huard is expected to miss another game while recovering from a bruised 
kidney this week. Jon Kitna will start again and might make several turnovers 
against an opportunistic Oakland defense.

>Below is a true story that was in the local newspaper about a recent

>Even Jay Leno mentioned it:
>
>This was a huge wedding with about 300 guests.  After the wedding,
>at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk

>to thank the bride's and groom's families for coming and to thank his new
>father-in-law for providing such a fabulous
>reception. To thank everyone for coming and bringing gifts and
>everything, he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift from just
>him.  So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair was a manila envelope,
>including the wedding party.  He said that this was his gift to everyone,
>and told everyone to open the envelopes. Inside each manila envelope was an
>8 x 10 picture of his best man having sex with the bride.  He had gotten
>suspicious of the two of them and hired a private detective to trail them
>weeks prior to the wedding. After he stood there and watched the people's
>reactions for a couple of  minutes, he turned to the best man and said
>""F--- you"", he turned to the bride and said ""F--- you"", and then he turned

>i.e. their parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, nieces and

Subject: A$M and its ""second tier"" status



Hate to promote the obvious.  US News & World Reports has their most current 
college rankings out, and, yes, Texas is in the top 50 schools in the 
country.  A$M in the meantime has returned to their fabled ""second tier"" 
status where all ""second tier"" schools belong.  I don't really care if Texas 
Monthly prints a huge front page article that says ""UT....THE BEST SCHOOL IN 
TEXAS"".....Of course Texas Monthly would never do that because IT ISN""T 
NEWS!!!!!!!   Tell us something we don't know!  You will recall that a couple 
of years ago, Texas Monthly reported that a$m was ""the best school in Texas"", 
relying on US NEWS & WORLD REPORTS rankings.  I guess that was short lived.

Whoops.  Looks like a$m is STILL ranked considerably lower than Texas in both 
Business and Engineering, in spite of the fact that every agroid will tell 
you differently.

   I think we'll have a lot of fun this weekend.  Sierra sounds good to me.  I
   really like that place--I was just there the other night for a recruiting
   dinner and it's all decorated for Christmas.

   Jill, Matt's date, who works at Deloitte also lives all the way out in the
   Woodlands and she is probably going to come to my house and get ready.  I
   guess we'll figure out the rest of the specifics later.

   Tomorrow is going to be a pretty rough day here at my client; so give me a
   call tomorrow night, if that's ok.  Or you can email me--for some reason I
   didn't get your email until 5:30 today and it looks like you sent it during
   lunch.

Hey Shirley,

I just wanted to drop you a line and tell you that I am looking forward to
Saturday night.  I don't know the specifics yet, but Chad and Matt had planned
on going to Sierra for drinks at around 7:30.  I'll give you a call tomorrow 
to
let you know all of the details.

See you soon.

Eric, I have reviewed the users that have access similar to yours and want to 
confirm if they are in the Risk Management group for Texas/HPLC.  Please let 
me know which users are not in your group and also add people in your group 
that I have not listed.

In addition, I noticed that some users have a Risk Management role while 
others have a Trader role.  The ONLY difference between those two roles is 
that the trader roles allows you to have access to Trade Blotter.  If no one 
is entering trades directly into Trade Blotter, let me know so that I can 
change everyone's roles to the Risk Management role.  It makes it a lot 
easier when I am trying to categorize users.  You still have access to Deal 
Ticker, Deal Manager (read/edit) and Position Manager under the Risk 
Management role.  Thank you for your time in advance and for your quick 
responses.  I understand that you are busy so please take your time in 
getting back with the requested information.

Subject: Risk Book Post ID's for EOL Reporting

There has apparently been some misunderstanding regarding the scope of 
calculations that must be covered under the Post ID's submitted for EOL 
reporting each night. Many desks are turning in post IDs which only cover 
books in which EOL activity has taken place, thus ommitting many other 
non-eol trades. What is needed is post IDs which will collectively cover the 
entire universe of gas trading which has taken place on a given desk. In 
running the collective post ID's we need to be able to capture all trading 
which has taken place on a given day and the scope of the post ID's must 
cover this.

Just thought I'd drop you a line.  Cool site, I guess you have too much spare 
time on your hands.  
Nothing too exciting is going on here in h-town - just working.  I am trading 
gas futures and other derivatives for excelr- it can get exciting at times 
(lots of $ flying trading hands), but I haven't got to blow anything up like 
you, so I feel that my life is somewhat lacking.  
Big news on Marilyn - I had thought that you broke up before your foray to 
Ft. Sill.  Do you get to see each other much?  

Where are you currently stationed? 

Drop me a line next time you come to houston?

Hey y'all,

Got bored, made a homepage, lemme know what you think.

address is:  http://lawlerspage.homestead.com/

I'm not sure but I think if I edit or add stuff to the page you have to
re-enter the address if u had it bookmarked so I reckon if u bookmark it and
it don't work it's cause I added some stuff.  Either that or it was just a
freak one time thing (I tried to use my bookmark today and it no workie).

Lawler, OUT.

i.e. Coal  4 mmbtu = 1 MW

Speaking of SEC dominance, Brian and I made a 100 dollar bet this weekend.  
Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour"" which 
will be paid for by Brian ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12"" 
Hoskins.

Place and time TBD

The following are links that have a map and a bracket for the tournament. 
Our first game is at 8:30 AM on Sunday. We have already lost Darren for the 
whole tournament and Gosset for at least the first game. 
Everyone must be there on TIME. That means that you must be at the fields no 
later than 8 AM! We now only have 10 guys for the first game!!!!!!!

If you can't make it at 8 AM, tell me know so we can replace you!!!!! 
EVERYONE e-mail me and let me know that you will be there by 8 AM! Gosset 
will fire you if you screw the team!!!!

Mike,

When (if :-) ) you have a minute could you do me a favour and send me an 
excel dump of all the deal numbers of GTMA Physical forwards we are expecting 
to settle for march production (27th to 1 April), with their projected 
volumes, the contract price, and the value?  This will help me get an idea of 
whether we have any missing data.  

Thanks

James

Speaking of SEC dominance, Brian and I made a 100 dollar bet this weekend.  
Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour"" which 
will be paid for by Brian ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12"" 
Hoskins.

Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour"" which 
will be paid for by Brian ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12"" 
Hoskins.

Place and time TBD

Eric,

Counterparty would like to see volume as 910,000/mo rather than 29355/day, 
due to the 5 MMBtu discrepancy our volume causes.  Can you adjust TAGG to the

Subject: Astros Tickets  

OK Gang,
Time to select (and pay) for 2001 tickets.
What I have is:
Gary Lamphier  25 games
Greg Brazaitis  20 games
Jason Mathew  10 games $340
Stacey Neuweiler 10 games $340
Eric Bass     5 games $170
Elsa V      5  games $170
Danny Conner     5  games $170

Jim Homco has two seats next to us and is hoping to trade so any of us can 
have 4 seats to a game and he can then have 4 seats to a game.
We need to draft this week.  I will set the rotation by number of tickets 
purchased to start the rotation then random draw.  In other words I will pick 
1st, Greg 2nd,
Stacey & Jason 3rd & 4th ( I will flip a coin that day) and Eric , Elsa and 
Danny to follow ( we will draw an order that day).  
So in summary there are 16  packages of 5 games; so every 16 games I will get 
5, Greg 4, Jason  and Stacey 2, and the other 3 one.
So round 1 would look like this:

 1) Gary
 2) Greg
 3) Jason/Stacey
 4) Jason/Stacey
 Picks 5-16 will then be pulled out of a hat to determine order for all 
remaining picks with Gary's name 4 times, Greg 3 times, and every one else 
once.
We need to do this this week.  How about Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday from 
11:00 - 1:00 (we should finish earlier).  The schedule is at astros.mlb.com 
or I will bring hard copies for you.

Please respond today of any date that does not work.

Box Score Banter
The following question and statistical numbers come via J.C. Corrigan of 
Richmond, Va.

He asks:

""Which conference is best? Pac -0? ACC? SEC? Big 10? Big 12? Big East? Using 
the RPI, I evaluated the top eight teams in each conference (ACC is the 
smallest in terms of members, and I threw out their ""Russian judge"" team). 
If you were to add these individual team RPI up, the least sum would 
indicate the greatest depth:

Big Ten, 178; SEC, 194; Big East, 246; Big 12, 278; ACC, 369; Pac-10, 382.

Now some may argue that you should not count the bottom teams, since half 
are forced into a losing record. Others say, only one team can win, so why 
concern yourself with the bottom feeders? To refute that, here's what the 
sums look like using only the top four teams from each conference:

SEC, 40; Pac-10, 41; ACC, 48; Big Ten, 49; Big East, 66; Big 12, 69.

If indeed each conference has their bottom feeders, then we want to make 
sure there are no ""gimmies"" for those teams on top. So what's the RPI rating 
of the lowest team in each conference?

SEC, 103 (LSU); Big Ten, 135 (Northwestern); Big 12, 157 (Texas Tech); Big 
East, 167 (Virginia Tech); ACC, 168 (Clemson) Pac-10, 173 (Washington State)

Others will argue that we should include each team and then ""normalize"" 
based on the number of teams per conference. This will also account for the 
small differences between teams and reward second-tier team strength. Here 
are the conferences with their average RPI and median RPI.

SEC (39.1, 38.5), Big Ten (39.4, 29.0), Big East (45.2, 49.0), ACC (59.7, 
35.0), Big 12 (66.7, 47.0), Pac-10 (70.8, 55.0).

This data clearly shows how ""top heavy"" the ACC, Big 12 and Pac-10 are. But 
who's the best? When evaluating where each conference ranks across the these 
five categories:

SEC: 2-1-1-1-3 8

Big Ten: 1-4-2-2-1 10

Big East: 1-5-4-3-4 17

ACC: 5-3-5-4-2 19

Big 12: 4-6-3-5-4 22

Pac-10: 6-2-6-6-6 26

The SEC has a slight edge over the Big Ten, but some may say the RPI is 
biased. So how would these numbers hold up using the Sugaring Ratings?

SEC: 10

Big 10: 11

ACC: 12

Big 12: 20

Pac-10: 22

Big East: 29

Personally, I think the RPI is a little more accurate. Hope you found this 
interesting in my attempt to answer the oldest question in the NCAA book. 
Ideally, I would like to include head-to-head competition and run these 
numbers, but I'm an amateur and I don't that much time on my hands.""

Hi Guy. Do hope you have a great trip to Vegas. It  should be fun. Do not let 
those tables become too attractive to you. The more  time you spend @ the 
tables the greater the odds are that the house will take  your money. I talk 
from experience. Nice touch on the flowers to your Mom. She  really is 
enjoying them. It made her feel good that you remembered her on  Valentine's

Big talk for a guy whose school is on NCAA probation as we speak.  

http://www.ncaa.org/databases/db1/probation.html

By the way, I see from the latest RPIs that LSU is really pulling their 
weight as the lowest-ranked team in the SEC, right behind Austin Peay.  But 
hey, at least you're still ahead of Iona and Bradley.

Excerpt from an article on espn.com

Given Kentucky's decades-long legacy of cheating in both basketball and

                  ousting Mumme was a mandatory move. The school's image is 
too fragile to
                  countenance keeping a coach with major violations on his

Come talk to me when your team can score more than 33 points in a game.  
LSU's basketball dynasty is officially over.  Oh, wait a minute.  It never 
began.  




Mississippi 50, LSU 33
		
 
OXFORD, Miss. (AP) _ Aaron Harper scored 16 points to lead No. 25 Mississippi 
to a 50-33 victory over Louisiana State on Wednesday night. 
Harper was the only player in double figures for the Rebels (18-4, 6-3 
Southeastern Conference), who won their fourth consecutive game exactly one 
year after their worst home loss in 40 years _ a 97-53 loss to LSU. 
Roland Dupree had 14 points and a game-high 11 rebounds for LSU (11-9, 1-8), 
which was held to fewer than 40 points for the first time since a 51-39 loss 
at Rice in 1948. 
The Rebels limited the Tigers to 12-of-43 shooting from the field and forced 
them into 25 turnovers. 
LSU also shot just 1-of-16 from 3-point range, but stayed close before the 
Rebels put it away with a decisive 19-4 run. 
LSU led only once, on Dupree's opening basket. Ole Miss answered with a 12-5 
run and never trailed again. Harper made three consecutive baskets to 
highlight the surge. 
The Rebels led 19-15 at halftime, but LSU pulled within 23-22 with 15:19 
remaining on a basket by Jermaine Williams. LSU never got any closer as Ole 
Miss went on its decisive 19-4 run in the next seven minutes. Harper sparked 
the surge with a pair of 3-pointers and two assists. 
LSU's DuPree got a technical foul during the run, following his protest of an 
offensive foul by teammate Torris Bright. 
Jason Harrison hit both technical foul free throws and Harper followed with a 
3-pointer to complete the run and give Ole Miss a 42-26 lead with 7:23 left.

Hey Shanna -

How was your weekend in Louisiana?  Did you and Eric have fun?  I'm emailing
because last weekend I was really sick and had to cancel dinner and dancing.
I went to the doctor and found out I had pneumonia.  I rescheduled dinner
for this Friday, so if you and Eric are free, I would love for the two of
you to come.  Dinner is at Lupe Tortilla at 8:30.  We'll probably go dancing
afterwards!

Let me know if you guys can come.

Take care -

Hey Shanna -

How was your weekend in Louisiana?  Did you and Eric have fun?  I'm emailing
because last weekend I was really sick and had to cancel dinner and dancing.
I went to the doctor and found out I had pneumonia.  I rescheduled dinner
for this Friday, so if you and Eric are free, I would love for the two of
you to come.  Dinner is at Lupe Tortilla at 8:30.  We'll probably go dancing
afterwards!

Let me know if you guys can come.

Take care -

A salesman from New Jersey pulled off the highway to get gas in Tyler, TX
recently and wandered into town to soak up the local culture. He noticed a
'Nativity Scene' that showed great skill and talent had gone into creating
it. One small feature bothered him however. The 3 wisemen were wearing
firemens helmets. Totally unable to come up with a reason or explanation,
he left. However, when he stopped at the E-Z Mart to get gas, he ask the lady
behind the counter about the helmets. She exploded into a rage, yelling,
""You Yankees never do read the Bible!"" He assured her that he did, but simply
couldn't recall anything about firemen in the Bible. She jerked her Bible
from behind the counter and ruffled thru some pages, and finally jabbed
her finger at a passage. Sticking it in his face she said See, it says right
here, ""The three wise men came from afar.""

READ THIS. LET IT REALLY  SINK IN.? THEN CHOOSE HOW YOU 
START YOUR DAY. 

Michael is the  kind of guy you love to hate. He is 
always in a good 
mood 
and  
always has something positive to say.? When someone 
would ask him  how 
he 
was 
doing, he would reply, ""If I were any better, I would  
be twins!"" 

He was a natural motivator.? If an employee was  having 
a bad day, 
Michael 
was there telling the employee how to look  on the 
positive side of the 
situation. 

Seeing this style really  made me curious, so one day I 
went up to 
Michael 
and asked him, ""I  don't get it! You can't be a 
positive person all of 
the 
time.  
How do you do it?"" 

Michael replied, ""Each morning I wake up and say  to 
myself, you have 
two 
choices today.? You can choose to be in  a good mood 
or...you can choose? 
to 
be in a bad 
mood.?  I choose to be in a good mood.? Each time 
something bad happens, 
I  
can choose to be a victim or...I can choose to learn 
from it. I choose  
to 
learn from it. 
Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can  
choose to accept 
their 
complaining or...I can point out the positive  side of 
life. I choose 
the 
positive side of life. 

""Yeah,  right, it's not that easy,"" I protested. 

""Yes, it is,"" Michael said.  ""Life is all about 
choices. When you cut 
away 
all the junk, every  situation is a choice. You choose 
how you react to 
situations. You  choose how people affect your mood. 
You choose to be in 
a 
good mood  or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your 
choice how you live 
your  
life."" 

I reflected on what Michael said. Soon hereafter, I 
left  the Tower 
Industry 
to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often  
thought about him 
when 
I made a choice about life instead of  reacting to it. 

Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved  
in a serious 
accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications  
tower.? After 18 
hours 
of surgery and weeks of intensive care,  Michael was 
released from the 
hospital with rods placed in his back.  

I saw Michael about six months after the accident. 
When I asked him  how 
he 
was, he replied. ""If I were any better, I'd be twins. 
Wanna  see my 
scars?"" 

I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what  
had gone through 
his 
mind as the accident took place. ""The first  thing that 
went through my 
mind 
was the well-being of my soon to be  born daughter, "" 
Michael replied. 
""Then, 
as I lay on the ground, I  remembered that I had two 
choices: I could 
choose 
to live or ...I  could choose to die. I chose to live."" 

""Weren't you scared? Did you lose  consciousness?"" I 
asked. Michael 
continued, ""...the paramedics were  great. They kept 
telling me I was 
going 
to be fine. But when they  wheeled me into the ER and I 
saw the 
expressions 
on the faces of the  doctors and nurses, I got really 
scared.? In their 
eyes, 
I read  ""he's a dead man. I knew I needed to take 
action."" 

""What did you  do?"" I asked. 

""Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions  
at me,"" said 
Michael. 
""She asked if I was allergic to anything.  ""Yes, I 
replied."" The doctors 
and 
nurses stopped working as they  waited for my reply. I 
took a deep 
breath 
and 
yelled, ""Gravity.""  

Over their laughter, I told them, ""I am choosing to 
live. Operate on  me 
as 
if I am alive, not dead."" 

Michael lived, thanks to the  skill of his doctors, but 
also because of 
his 
amazing attitude. I  learned from him that every day we 
have the choice 
to 
live fully.  Attitude, after all, is everything. 
""Therefore do not worry 
about  tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. 

After all today is the  tomorrow you worried about 
yesterday. 

You have two choices now:  
1. Delete this. 
2. Forward it to the people you care about. 

You  know the choice I made.

A salesman from New Jersey pulled off the highway to get gas in Tyler, TX
recently and wandered into town to soak up the local culture. He noticed a
'Nativity Scene' that showed great skill and talent had gone into creating
it. One small feature bothered him however. The 3 wisemen were wearing
firemens helmets. Totally unable to come up with a reason or explanation,
he left. However, when he stopped at the E-Z Mart to get gas, he ask the lady
behind the counter about the helmets. She exploded into a rage, yelling,
""You Yankees never do read the Bible!"" He assured her that he did, but simply
couldn't recall anything about firemen in the Bible. She jerked her Bible
from behind the counter and ruffled thru some pages, and finally jabbed
her finger at a passage. Sticking it in his face she said See, it says right
here, ""The three wise men came from afar.""

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/12/00 
 Alstott could be back in practice on Thursday, a full two weeks ahead of 
schedule in his return from a sprained knee. If all goes well, he could play 
in the Monday night game against St. Louis, or at worst, the season finale 
against Green Bay on December 24. It's probably best to keep Alstott on your 
bench during the Fantasy playoffs, although there's an outside shot he could 
make an impact during the final game if he gets into the swing of things 
quickly.  

 Chad Morton , RB NO - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Morton is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Atlanta with a 
separated shoulder, although he was able to play with a shoulder injury last 
Sunday. We don't recommend him for your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Head Coach Jim Haslett says he hopes to re-sign Moore, who was placed on 
waivers on Saturday. Moore became expendable with the addition of veteran 
Terry Allen, and won't have any Fantasy value even if he returns.  

 Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Hatchette injured the oblique muscle above his hip during last Sunday's game 
against St. Louis. He's listed as day to day, but is expected to play Sunday 
against Green Bay. He's not someone who will help your Fantasy team much, 
though.  

 Chris Walsh , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Walsh is unlikely to play Sunday against Green Bay after he underwent 
surgery on Tuesday on a broken bone in his left cheek. He suffered the injury 
during last Sunday's game against St. Louis but finished the game. Walsh has 
been valuable to the Vikings on special teams and as the No. 4 receiver, but 
he's not a viable Fantasy option.  

 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 12/12/00 
 The Jaguars will need to evaluate Taylor's sprained left knee during 
practice this week before determining his status for Sunday's game against 
Cincinnati. He suffered the injury during the third quarter of last Sunday's 
game, which was his seventh straight with at least 100 rushing yards. 
Hopefully Taylor will be able to play, as he's among the best options at 
running back during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Northcutt will miss Cleveland's final game of the season Sunday against 
Tennessee due to a sprained ankle. Believe it or not, this likely hurts the 
Browns' quarterbacking situation most, as he was rotating in that slot last 
Sunday against Philadelphia. It's best to avoid any Cleveland players at this 
stage of the Fantasy season.  

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - FIBSABs Updated 12/12/00 
 Enis, who missed last Sunday's game against New England due to a reaction to 
an over-the-counter flu medicine, was feeling better Monday. Still, his 
status for Sunday's game against San Francisco is unknown, so it's best to 
keep him on your bench this week.  

 Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bears Coach Dick Jauron may give Matthews the start at quarterback on Sunday 
against San Francisco, instead of giving Cade McNown the final two starts. 
One possible reason for that may be that Matthews aggravated an injury when 
he was rushed back last season, and Jauron didn't want the same to happen to 
McNown. We don't recommend either quarterback this week, despite him facing 
the weak Niners' pass defense.   

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - Baja Updated 12/12/00 
 Biakabutuka, who has missed four games with turf toe, may be able to 
practice on Wednesday. Even if he is able to play Sunday against San Diego, 
we wouldn't recommend Biakabutuka the remainder of the season.  

 Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Although he's most likely the quarterback for 2001, Beuerlein might be 
benched for backup Jeff Lewis for part of Carolina's final two games. Nothing 
is worse than a part-time quarterback for your Fantasy playoffs, so steer 
clear of both players if at all possible.  

 Jeff Lewis , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Coach George Seifert says that he may give Lewis some playing time over the 
final two games, although he has endorsed Steve Beuerlein as the starter for 
2001. Lewis has a high cost against the cap, so the Panthers need to 
determine soon whether he's the quarterback of the future. On the other hand, 
Beuerlein has the third-longest consecutive-starts streak in the league at QB 
and may not want to end it. Lewis isn't someone we'd recommend during your 
Fantasy playoffs, whether he starts or not.  

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 German was unable to practice Monday, and may be placed on injured reserve 
on Tuesday with a badly sprained left ankle. He has no Fantasy value.  

 Bills , DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' defense has been ravaged by injuries this season, and it 
certainly showed on Monday night. Although Indianapolis did score two 
defensive touchdowns in the game, Buffalo's D still gave up 30 points to 
Indy. Once a solid defensive unit, the Bills are now just a shell of their 
former selves and shouldn't be considered a starting defensive squad on your 
Fantasy team.   

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/12/00 
 Christie made up for his scoreless performance last week with two field 
goals on Monday night, including a 46-yard boot in the second quarter. He is 
one of the best placekickers in the league, and should be considered a weekly 
starter on your Fantasy team.   

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' young wideout has only 12 receptions in his last six games and 
hasn't seen the end zone since Week Three against the Jets. What little 
Fantasy value he may have had early in the season is all but gone now.   

 Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Vanderjagt converted on all three of his field goal attempts in Monday 
night's win over Buffalo. He is one of the NFL's most accurate kickers, 
missing only two field goals the entire season. Starting Vanderjagt this week 
is a good idea against a tough Miami defesne that doesn't allow many 
touchdowns.   

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Pollard hasn't had more than two catches in any game in the last four weeks, 
and hasn't scored a touchdown since Week Five. Translation: Avoid starting 
Pollard at all costs for the duration of your Fantasy season.   

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 With only seven receptions in the last four weeks, including only one on 
Monday night, Dilger has become a Fantasy afterthought. Avoid starting him if 
your roster allows it.  

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/12/00 
 Pathon caught three passes for 31 yards on Monday night against the Bills. 
At this point in the season, Pathon has no Fantasy value.   

 Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Moulds had another sub-par performance on Monday night, catching only two 
passes for 47 yards in the Bills' loss to Indianapolis. In the last two 
weeks, Moulds has caught only four balls for 58 yards and no touchdowns. 
Fantasy owners who have Moulds should continue starting him in the Fantasy 
playoffs and hope that he can break out of this semi-slump.    

 Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Klap Updated 12/12/00 
 Wilkins came back down to earth after last week's 109-yard, one touchdown 
performance against the Jets, catching only two passes for 37 yards on Monday 
night. Wilkins has been far more effective on special teams than as a 
receiver in recent weeks, so don't expect much production in the final two 
weeks of the season.    

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 12/12/00 
 To the disbelief of many Fantasy owners, Harrison was held in check in 
Monday night's game with the Bills. He caught only two passes for 27 yards 
against what was an injury-depleted Buffalo secondary - a performance which 
may have helped keep some owners from moving on in their playoffs. If you 
were lucky enough to advance, Harrison is still a must start, even against 
the Colts' next opponent, the Miami Dolphins. In the team's first meeting, 
Harrison scorched the Fish for 74 yards receiving and two scores.     

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Price had his best performance of the season on Monday night, catching four 
passes for 93 yards and a touchdown in Buffalo's loss to the Colts. These 
were the types of numbers that Fantasy owners were expecting all season from 
Price, but they are still too little, too late to consider him for your 
starting lineup.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Morris returned to limited duty on Monday night after missing two games with 
an ankle injury. He accounted for 34 yards of total offense and a touchdown 
in the Bills' 44-20 loss. Morris will likely be splitting time with Shawn 
Bryson in the backfield, so it's a good idea to avoid starting either of 
Buffalo's tailbacks at this point.  

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries against the Colts on Monday night, 
rushing the ball 15 times for 45 yards.  His main production, however, came 
through the air, where he caught six passes for 75 yards. Bryson's 120 yards 
of total offense is impressive, but he still isn't a viable option for 
Fantasy owners at this point in the season.    

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/12/00 
 ""The Edge"" had a terrific Fantasy performance on Monday night, compiling 132 
yards of total offense and three touchdowns in the Colts' big win over 
Buffalo. James will face a Miami squad that gave up 118 yards rushing to him 
back in Week 12, but also kept him out of the end zone. When it comes really 
comes down to it, the Colts could be facing the 1985 Bears' defense and it 
wouldn't matter - James is a must start for the duration of the Fantasy 
playoffs.  

 Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/12/00 
 Manning had a very un-Peyton like performance on Monday night, completing 
13-of-24 passes for only 132 yards and no touchdowns in the Colts' 44-20 win. 
It was the first time this season that Manning was held with out at least one 
touchdown pass in a game. If your team survived Manning's poor Fantasy 
performance, you may not like his team's next opponent - Miami. The Dolphins 
have two of the best corners in the game in Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison, 
so it isn't out of the question for Manning to have another sub-par 
performance. At this point in the season, it is a good idea to stick with the 
former Vols star and hope he can have a more typical Peyton Manning day.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Huard is expected to miss another game while recovering from a bruised 
kidney this week. Jon Kitna will start again and might make several turnovers 
against an opportunistic Oakland defense.  

 Randy Jordan , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Jordan has a turf toe injury and will miss some practice time this week. He 
will play at Seattle but might be used sparingly.

15646,bass-e/all_documents/190.,<30842087.1075854578566.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Norv Turner Fired   From the article:
http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/ce/multi/0,1329,3141082_59,00.html   Washington
Redskins coach Norv Turner was fired Monday after failing to live up to
Super Bowl expectations with the most expensive team in NFL history.  Turner
was dismissed by owner Dan Snyder one day after a 9-7 loss to the New York
Giants. It was the fourth loss in five games for the Redskins (7-6) and
third in a row at home, and it moved a team with championship aspirations
precariously close to elimination from the playoff race.
Passing game coordinator Terry Robiskie was named interim coach. He
immediately began holding team meetings for Sunday's game in Dallas.
Turner fought back tears as he said goodbye.
""I've obviously been put in a good position to have an opportunity to win,""
Turner said. ""This team has a chance to be 10-6. That's a disappointment to
me. There's part of me that would like to be a part of it. There's part of
me that understands why it's necessary to make a change right now.""
Turner, 48, earned a reputation as a master strategist with the Dallas
Cowboys, where he was the offensive coordinator for two Super Bowl teams in
the early 1990s. Some of his game plans in Washington were truly masterful,
but his lack of communication skills and inability to keep players focused
and motivated led to his downfall.
Injuries also slowed the offense. Three starters were lost for the season
and several others played hurt.
The reconstituted offensive line had its worst day Sunday. However, there
were also many unforced errors such as dropped balls, missed blocks and bad
snaps.
Robiskie, 46, becomes the NFL's third black head coach. He is a former
offensive coordinator with the Oakland Raiders and was one of Turner's first
hires in Washington in 1994. He is known for a tough-love coaching style
from his dealings with temperamental Redskins receivers Michael Westbrook
and Albert Connell.
""He might add a little more fire to it,"" Connell said.
The Redskins also announced Franklin Pepper Rodgers would become vice
president of football operations and tight ends coach Pat Flaherty would
replace LeCharls McDaniel as special teams coach.
Rodgers, a former head coach at Kansas, UCLA and Georgia Tech and at Memphis
of the USFL, will head the team's selection process for a new head coach in
2001.
//////////

My View:  If I'm Turner, I'm happy to be out from under Danny Snyder.
That's all I have to say about that.  From a FF perspective, I wouldn't be
surprised to see the team show an uptick in intensity behind Robiskie.  We
saw it in Arizona and Cincinnati but the difference here will the be the
Redskins have the talent to turn that enthusiasm into productivity on the
field.  In other news, it looks like QB Jeff George gets another start this
weekend after replacing Brad Johnson.  Turner had been Johnson's protecting
saint so the QB move coinciding with the coaching change is not surprising.

See you tonight in our upgrades and downgrades.

Joe

I know we have visited before on this product, but now I would like to go

I mostly used the review course books.  You are welcome to borrow them if you 
like.  Otherwise, I am sure that either Kaplan or Princeton Review has some 
good books.  Check the AIMR website.

Bass,

Long time, no talk.  How's it going?  Hope the market is treating you well!

I have a question for you.  I am looking to take the CFA Level I test this 
summer.  I missed out on a review course I wanted to take.  I remember you 
said that you were taking the CFA, and I noticed you had a particular book 
you were studying.  I just wanted to see if you would recommend the book you 
studied.  If so, who produced it.

I saw Kaplan produces one, but I am not sure if it is any good.


I would really appreciate it.

Late,
GM

Subject: RE: Flag Football

Are you ready for some football!?!?!

I am trying to put together a flag football game this Sunday at 2:30 pm at 
Rice University.  I need YOUR help to pass this e-mail along to as many 
friends that you feel would be interested in friendly, competitive flag 
football.  If you are remotely interested, e-mail me your name and phone 
number, so I can create a contact list to pass out to everyone.  I don't have 
any flags or field cones, but if we get enough people interested, I'm sure 
excelr will sponsor us (if you have flags and/or cones, please bring them; 
I'll bring the football).

The location of our games will be at the practice field, East of the Rice U. 
stadium (across the parking lot).  I believe our playing field is on Rice 
University Blvd., between gates 12 and 13.  The field has two field goals and 
bleachers.  It's hard to miss!

I hope everyone is interested.  If not, we didn't need your slow, lazy, 
unathletic ass anyway...

My contact info is 713-345-7594.

Ladies & Gentlemen,

The BCS may have screwed up the match ups but that won't stop the annual 
College Bowl Pool from taking place.  The attached spreadsheet contains the 
rules and a pick sheet.  For the veterans the rules are the same as last 
year.  The entry fee is $25.  Money and picks are due Monday December 18th.  
Feel free to forward this to anyone that may be interested in participating.  

Cris

Hi Eric,

I don't think you want to look at it.  Notice that it is just one block from
the railroad tracks.  Talk about noise!

What time do you want to have dinner Saturday night?  I just got back from
the grocery store so everything is ready to prepare.  I will email Shanna
next.  Talk to you in a bit.  LU-M

ACCUSED MOLESTER PLEADS INNOCENT IN MONTANA COURT 
   A man accused of sexually molesting a 12-year-old boy, then killing
him and serving his body to his neighbors, has pleaded innocent in a
Great Falls, Mont., courtroom.
   Court records indicate that the man, Nathaniel Bar-Jonah, is a
career criminal. The 43-year-old is being held on half a million
dollars bond.
   Police say they found notes indicating that Bar-Jonah called dinners
cooked for friends and neighbors ""little boy stews.""
   He could face the death penalty if found guilty of murder and
several other charges, including impersonating a police officer.

[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]

Two local men were seriously injured when their pickup truck left the road
and struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State Highway 38 early Monday
morning.

Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident shortly after
midnight Monday.

Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are
listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred
as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip.

On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights malfunctioned.
The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had
burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the
.22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to
the steering wheel column.

After inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly
and the two men proceeded toward the White River bridge. After traveling
about 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently
overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle
swerved sharply right exiting the pavement and striking a tree.

Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident, but will
require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken
clavicle and was treated and released.

""Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls off or we
might both be dead"" stated Wallis.

""I've been a trooper for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a
first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accident
happened,"" said Snyder.

Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife asked how many frogs
the boys had caught and did anyone get them from the truck.
Way to go, Lavinia)

It is at 8:30.  We are supposed to be there at 8 to get all seated together.
This is the Laff Spot on 249 and 1960.  Come up the Beltway and go left on
249.  Exit Greens road and go through two lights.  It will be in strip
shopping center on your right side, about a quarter of a mile past Circuit
City.  It is in the same shopping center as a bar called Frogs Saloon.
Donnita's cell phone is 832-577-8235, in case you get lost.

Addendum No. 1

To whom it may concern:

It has been brought to my attention that there are some people who are
interested in playing paintball games.  However, we were going to play this
weekend but there are a lot of people who are unable to play due to
previous engagements so we are going to reschedule it for Saturday, January
20, 2001.  It will cost about $22.00 and that includes admission for the
whole day, rental of the gun and one Co2 cartridge.  However, paintballs
are extra and they cost about $6.50 per 100.  If we do end up playing it
would be recommend to bring a sandwich and drinks because there is not much
out there.

If you could, please RSVP by Wednesday, January 17, 2001, that way we can
decide if we have enough people to even play.  Rain or Shine!

Thank you,

George Kissamis

Vietnamese War Refugee Becomes Successful 
Cookbook Author in America

Dulles, VA -- (Xpress Press)-- Successful 
Georgetown clothing designer Diana My Tran, 
celebrates the culture of her homeland in 
THE VIETNAMESE COOKBOOK, an easy-to-follow 
guide to Vietnamese cuisine.

In 1975 Diana Tran left Vietnam as part of 
a mass exodus when Saigon fell to Ho Chi 
Minh's North Vietnamese troops. The pregnant 
20-year-old had no idea where she was going 
or what she would do when she arrived, and 
was forced to make a new life for herself 
in a foreign country.  Over the past two 
decades she has gone from not knowing a word 
of English to being a successful clothing 
designer and dressmaker, with clients in the 
upper echelons of politics, media, and society.

Yet despite her success in America, Diana 
staunchly holds on to her Vietnamese heritage. 
""I want to keep our family heritage alive, es-
pecially for my children.  The easiest way to 
do that is through the food.""  She says that 
when she first came to America, she missed the 
many joyous family celebrations and their acc-
ompanying feasts, and tried to recreate them 
for her new friends in America.

""When I first arrived in America, cooking 
Vietnamese dishes was a challenge, because 
there were no Asian food stores in Carlisle PA.  
Most of the time I could not find the tradi-
tional ingredients and had to make substitutions, 
but the food turned out just fine,"" she says. 
Diana recorded all of these substitutions in 
her cookbook, keeping the original tastes and 
textures. The recipes make use of ingredients 
easily found in local supermarkets, and show 
step-by-step instructions for making the healthy 
delights of Vietnamese cuisine fast and simply.

""My time for cooking is as limited as it ever 
was when I was a new immigrant,"" Tran says.  
""Traditional Vietnamese food can take time and 
effort to prepare-time I usually don't have, so 
I have created my own easier versions of Vietn-
amese dishes, tailored to the busy American 
lifestyle.""

Diana's cookbook has been featured in The 
Washington Post, The Chicago Sun-Times, Charlotte 
Observer, Arkansas Democrat Gazette, and the 
Portland Press-Herald.   Diana has also appeared 
on Fox Noon News in Washington, DC and Poor Man's 
Kitchen in Seattle, WA. She is available for inter-
views about her family's flight from Saigon and her 
American success story.

Hi Jason,
?
Sorry I didn't see your message til late  yesterday.? I've been researching 
our family tree and have been totally  consumed.? I believe I've traced it 
back to 1658 on your Grandpa's  side.? Isn't that fascinating?? I began this 
project for you and Eric  but, in the process, I have become consumed.? It's 
very, very  interesting.? I will organize all of this in the future so you 
and your  brother have it.? Part of the inspiration came from a book Shanna 
gave me  for my birthday.? I started to fill in some of the blanks about our 
family  and couldn't remember what Grandpa had told me.? I was saddened by 
this and  now he is gone and I cannot ask him anymore.? So, I decided to do 
something  about it. Our old family bible from 1853 gave me a good starting  
point.
?
About your resume.? I think it is wonderfully  done.? I spoke with Dad and he 
told me about his comments to you.? I  agree.? There is so much more about 
you that is good.
?
Have a good day and I'll talk to you soon.?  I'm going to copy this to Eric 
so I don't have to write it all over.? Off  to the cemeteries I go!!
?
Love you, Mom

Subject: Re: FW: Big commitment  

I have said it 15 times already, but I will say it again.  Texas was 4-7 in 
the season prior to Mack Brown.  The program was in shambles .  Mack Brown 
came in late and was unable to salvage a recruiting class his first year.  Lo 
and behold Texas goes 9-3, beat Nebraska in Lincoln (No. 3 at the time with 
the longest home winning streak in recent history), and destroys Miss St in 
the Cotton Bowl.   Those sound like some big wins don't they?  Does it sound 
familiar?  I doubt you can compare the teams that LSU beat with the teams 
Texas beat.  So my point is that players get up for new coaches.  You, as LSU 
fans,  fans can expect about the same next year as this year.    
Next year, is Texas' year ( and I know what you will say "" well that is what 
you say every year""), but Mack's first true recruits will be juniors and his 
first class (half his/half Mackovics) will be seniors.  So, if he doesn't win 
the big game next year, then you can call him a bad coach.  I have a problem 
saying he is  a bad coach after he has put together 3 straight 9 win seasons.

As a side note,  look who won the national championship game - the Big 12.  
If I am not mistaken, that makes the big 12 4-3  in the bowls while the Sec 
was 4-5.  If not for a bumbled extra point and a few dropped passes the 12 
would be 6-1 and the sec 3-6.  I see the beginnings of a new college fb 
powerhouse conference.  The Big 12 will win at least the next  2 NCs.

See ya

Looks like you guys have been having some fun during my absence.  I have a 
question:  How many top recruiting classes does it take for Texas to win a 
few big games in a single football season.  Dinnardo left LSU's recruiting 
program in shambles.  Last year was one of the worst recruiting seasons in 
LSU team history.  However, WE still managed to pull off some amazing team 
victories this year.

If there is one thing I learned from watching LSU this season, its that its 
nice to have talent on your team but its more important to have HEART and 
PRIDE.  So keep watching your Texas big names choke and I'll keep watching 
our TIGER No-Names win.

As Always, its all in Good Fun.

i am going to use a matt lenhart argument - alla texas lost to arkansas last 
year who lost to lsu.  . . .       texas played horribly against oregon and 
still had a great chance to win (and should have won) at the end of the 
game.  oregon beat washington who beat miami who beat fsu who should beat 
oklahoma tonite.  that means that texas should be national champions.

get real . . .  one 8-4 season after a decade of failure does not a 
championship caliber program make.  our team did the same thing right after 
mack arrived (9-3 with big win in cotton bowl) you can expect about the same 
next year.

lsu is getting some good recruits this year - you should be happy - in a 
couple of years your team will compete for sec and national championships.

but don't start talking smack after a win over a lousy ACC team.

My thoughts for the trip:

Friday:

Everyone says that you have to see the zoo if you are in San Diego.  Even- if 
you don't particularly like zoos.  Everything I read says that it will take 
at least half a day.  I say we hit that Friday morning through early 
afternoon.  Spend mid-afternoon near the hotel- beach area- suppose to be 
shopping, etc. near there.  Then go to the game.  When we get back that 
night- we can walk on the beach!

Saturday:

Visit Balboa Park.  See the Botanical Gardens, in other musuems/gardens in 
the area that look interesting.  If we aren't sick of seeing animals, there 
is suppose to be a wonderful Wild Animal Park that gives trolley or walking 
tours (the tours are only like an hour and a half).  After that- there is a 
ferry you can take across the bay to the Coronado Island to see the Hotel del 
Coronado.  It is suppose to be a really neat place.  Then- you we can finish 
the day in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown.  It is suppose to have a ""lively 
evening street scene"" and live music.

What do you think?  Let me know- so I can look up times that all of these 
open- if we are interested.

Hi Dearest,

Yes, 2001 will be better.  I have an appt. for a complete physical on Jan.
3.  Why don't you call and get your lab work done that day and we'll go for
lunch?

Yes, New Year's Eve sounds good with the boys.  I sent you messages from
both the boys.  Isn't it nice that they, independent of each other, think of
spending New Year's Eve with us?  That makes me feel good.  I can't think of
anybody I'd rather spend the evening with than my wonderful men and the
boys' signficant others.

SWCC would be fine.  Also, Ruth Chris' but that would be pricey.  I had
originally thought that the little Mexican place on 90A could cater some
food.  They're good and I just thought of that place we just read about -
Cafe what's her name on 90A.  But, by far, the easiest and least expensive,
I think, would be SWCC.

Love you, Toot

from Jason, asking about New Year's eve. Eric also wanted to know what we
were doing. I told him we might get together with the Heberts, but they were

Hi Dearest,

Yes, 2001 will be better.  I have an appt. for a complete physical on Jan.
3.  Why don't you call and get your lab work done that day and we'll go for
lunch?

Yes, New Year's Eve sounds good with the boys.  I sent you messages from
both the boys.  Isn't it nice that they, independent of each other, think of
spending New Year's Eve with us?  That makes me feel good.  I can't think of
anybody I'd rather spend the evening with than my wonderful men and the
boys' signficant others.

SWCC would be fine.  Also, Ruth Chris' but that would be pricey.  I had
originally thought that the little Mexican place on 90A could cater some
food.  They're good and I just thought of that place we just read about -
Cafe what's her name on 90A.  But, by far, the easiest and least expensive,
I think, would be SWCC.

Love you, Toot

  Hi Toot. Hope you start to feel better, soon. You have certainly had more
than your share of pain this year. Next year will be better. Saw the e-mail
from Jason, asking about New Year's eve. Eric also wanted to know what we
were doing. I told him we might get together with the Heberts, but they were
in any event welcomed to join us. Why don't we put together something simple
with the boys and D and S? We still have that wonderful Champagne from last
year.Maybe we could go to dinner early @ SWCC, then back home for games and
Champagne. Let me know what you think. If that sounds good, I will call SWCC
and find out the details. I am assuming the boys are available. Love you-L

Subject: My Complaint letter to America West


I thought you all might find this an interesting read.  Sorry, the
complaint form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed
the
form is the same that hired there ticketing help.

-E

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was
wonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered
us to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful 
except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.  

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for 
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride 
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the 
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because 
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for 
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of 
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no 
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which 
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was 
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline 
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us 
to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that 
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible 
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this 
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on 
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.  
It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my 
vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.  
I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed 
our connection we were forced to spend a combined

According to reports out of Foxboro, New England  Patriots quarterback Drew=
=20
Bledsoe took his regular  turn at practice for the second day in a row Frid=
ay=20
and all  indications are the veteran signal caller will start and play as =
=20
usual against the Chiefs Monday night.=20

Of course, that hardly means Bledsoe is  100 percent healthy; he's anything=
=20
but. And whether it's jammed,  bruised, sprained, fractured, broken or just=
=20
plain old sore, the  real problem is trying to figure out just how badly th=
e=20
thumb on his  throwing hand is injured and how much it affects his ability=
=20
to  throw the ball.=20

Not surprisingly, head coach Bill  Belichick says Bledsoe is no worse off=
=20
than he's been the  previous three weeks.=20

""This is the 13th week of the season.  There will be a lot of players out=
=20
there on both teams who will be  less than 100 percent, and (Chiefs=20
quarterback  Elvis) Grbac is one of them,"" said  Belichick. ""Same thing wit=
h=20
our quarterback. That's football in the  13th week of the season.""=20

Bledsoe came out of the chute strong in  Detroit on Thanksgiving day, but=
=20
regressed as the game progressed,  throwing two crucial fourth-quarter=20
interceptions that kept the team  from mounting a realistic comeback... And=
=20
even though Bledsoe  continues to insist the thumb isn't affecting his=20
throws, you'd be  hard-pressed to find any evidence backing that contention=
.=20

The bottom line here says a lack quality  depth at the key offensive skill=
=20
positions around him make it very  difficult to rely on Bledsoe for=20
consistent production...=20

Other items of interest...=20

Michael Felger of  the Boston Herald noted earlier this week that with  the=

would love come out and run the ball on the Chiefs. The  question is whethe=
r=20
injury-prone J.R. Redmond will  be up to the task. If not, look for Belichi=

to spread the load  between Redmond and fellow rookie Patrick Pass. =20

Mitchell missed last week's game against Pittsburgh  because of a sprained=

Mitchell took the majority of snaps at Friday's  practice.=20

last week before the Pittsburgh game.=20

=01&I don't think that will be necessary, unless some  complications develo=

Former Steeler wide out Malcolm  Johnson is becoming part of the Jets syste=

ego.? He missed practice on Tuesday, but typically plays  hurt.? If he can 
not go, look for John Friesz (and his less than 100% knee)  to take the field.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) practiced again  Friday and looks to 
be ok.? I doubt he'll be 100% for the rest of the  season but he's apparently 
able to manage the pain and limitation from the  thumb.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) is turning quite a few heads with his stellar  play.?? 
He starts again this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Aaron Brooks (NO) has a shot  at unseating Jeff Blake 
for the 2001 starter in New Orleans according to ESPN's  Chris Mortensen.? So 
besides the obvious playoff situation, he's playing  for stakes that extend 
past this season.? 

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit)  is probable with a sore calf, but expects to 
start.? 

QB Jerome  Bettis (Pit) has a sore leg, but it will take a lot more than that 
to keep him  off the field.

QB Moses Moreno (SD) needs to trade away a commandment or  two for a more 
durable body.? He appears on the injured list again as  questionable with a 
sore knee.? Ryan Leaf, who has a sore groin,? will  start again in his place.

QB Jon Kitna (Sea) gets the start this week for  the injured Brock Huard.? 
Brock is out indefinitely with a bruised kidney  and was just released from 
the hospital earlier this week.

QB Kurt Warner  (StL) took snaps and has looked great throwing in practice.? 
He will start  this week.? Trent Green will back him up.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Kurt Warner (StL) will likely be  playing on a less 
than optimal field in Carolina Sunday.? Besides the  grass, they're looking 
at possible snow.

QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on  Wednesday and looks to start against the 
Cowboys.? Eric Zeier would play if  Shaun king suffered a set-back.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on  Wednesday and looks to start this week.? 
He is listed as questionable on  the injury report with a hurt thumb.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is back behind  center while Jeff George watches.? I 
doubt we have seen the last of this  controversy.

////////////////////////////////

Running  backs in the News:
*** Saturday Update? RB Thomas Jones (Ari) has been  deactivated for this 
week's game as he's still recovering from  pneumonia.??? More work for 
Michael Pittman.

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo (Bal) is gone for the season.

RB Jamal  Lewis (Bal) is on a bye this week.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf) was able to  practice briefly on Wednesday and is 
questionable for this week's game.? He  is having troublemaking the hard cuts 
so will likely be ineffective even if he  plays.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Sammy Morris (Buf) isn't looking  much better as we 
near kickoff.? I'm not expecting much of anything from  him this week.

RB William Floyd (Car) will miss this game.

RB  Tshimanga?Biakabutuka (Car) likely returns to the lineup this week. He 
is  listed as probable with a sore toe.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) had a  setback this week 
and has been deactivated for Sunday's game.? Look for RB  Brad Hoover to get 
another start.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Corey Dillon (Cin)? QB Scott  Mitchell (Cin)?looked 
good again in practice Friday and is now  probable.? He'll likely get the 
start which is good news for his  teammates.
*** Saturday Update FB Nick Williams (Cin) ?likely  starts for Clif Groce 
Sunday.

RB Jamel White (Cle) is banged up with a sore shoulder.? Look for  Travis 
Prentice to ""shoulder"" more of the load this week.

RB Emmitt Smith  (Dal) has shaken off the concussion and will start this week.

RB Terrell  Davis (Den) is out this week with calf problems.? Mike Anderson 
gets the  start again this week.

RB Detron Smith (Den) can play if needed with his  sore thumb.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) misses yet another game.? Ahman  Green will get the 
start.

RB Lamar Smith (Mia) practiced on Wednesday and  is expected to be the 
starter despite being listed as questionable on the injury  report with a 
tender hamstring.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Lamar Smith (Mia) continues to look  good in practice 
and should be good to go.

RB Jimmy Kleinsasser (Min) is  probable with a sore hamstring.

RB JR Redmond (NE) appears as  questionable on the injury report with bruised 
ribs, but he expects to  play.

RB Ricky Williams (NO) is healing way ahead of schedule.? He  may now be 
ready for the last game of the regular season.? His cast is  expected to come 
off later this week.

RB Jerald Moore (NO) is listed as  questionable on the injury report with a 
sore neck.? He is still expected  to start though, but Chad Morton may see a 
few more reps than usual.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Jerald Moore (NO) was upgraded to  probably after a 
good practice Thursday and looks to start.

RB Curtis  Martin (NYJ) plans on playing through the pain.? He is listed as 
probable  with a sore gluteus.? I am guessing he is the butt of many New 
York  jokes.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) apparently is  better with a week 
to heal and should be able to make a bigger contribution this  week.? 

RB Leon Johnson has been re-signed by the Jets and will  return punts.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is banged up with a sore knee and  finger, but his 
ankles are better.? He will play this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Napoleon Kaufman (Oak)  tweaked his hamstring 
Thursday and is?was listed as questionable.? He  did do some work Saturday 
and looks improved. If he is limited,  this?increases the workload Wheatley 
will see and could open the door for  newly signed Terry Kirby.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this  week and he is using the time to 
look for personalized items with his last  name.? We will keep you posted.

RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as  questionable with a sore hamstring.? On a 
team that already has a crowded  backfield with Jermaine Fazande and Terrell 
Fletcher, Kenny looks like he could  be placed on the inactive list this week.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) has a  broken rib, but is expected to play with the 
pain.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) practiced  again Friday and 
looks to start Sunday.

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) is listed  as questionable on the injury report, but 
is doubtful he would have played  anyway.? The team remains cautious in his 
comeback.

RB Mike Alstott  (TB) will not play this week.? Look for Warrick Dunn to get 
plenty of  opportunities against a soft Dallas defense.

RB Eddie George (Ten)  skipped Wednesday's practice, but expects to practice 
today and play this  weekend.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Eddie George (Ten) looked good in  practice Friday and 
will start.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is listed as  questionable with a sore knee.

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will play with his  sore forearm.? Look for the Giants 
to attempt to arm-tackle him all day.  
*** Saturday Update RB Stephen Davis (Was) certainly  sounds like he's sure 
to play this week.? Although it has to be noted he  sounded like that last 
week.? While I feel pretty good that he'll play, the  worry here is one good 
shot to the arm could really have an effect.? 

///////////////////////////////////

Wide Receivers in  the News:

WR Frank Sanders (Ari) is expected to play with a sore  leg.

WR Brian Finneran (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to  play with 
a sore back.

WR Qadry Ismail (Bal) is on a bye this  week.

WR Jermaine Lewis (Bal) will use this week to heal his shoulder he  injured 
in last week's game.

WR Peerless Price (Buf) is expected to play  with a sore ankle.

WR Donald Hayes (Car) is expected to start with a sore  groin.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Donald Hayes (Car)?was able to  practice Friday and is 
still looking like a go for Sunday.? Watch for the  snow however.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Marcus Robinson (Chi) was  released from the hospital 
after spending a few days keeping an eye on his  back.? He's been downgraded 
to doubtful and I'm really not looking for  anything from this weekend.? He'd 
been struggling with QB Shane Matthews  anyway.? I'd look elsewhere if you 
can.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Marty Booker (Chi) looks to see  more playing time 
with Robinson's back troubles.?
?
*** Saturday Update?WR Peter Warrick  (Cin)?? QB Scott Mitchell (Cin)?looked 
good again in  practice Friday and is now probable.? He'll likely get the 
start which is  good news for his teammates.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle) is listed as  questionable with a sore knee.? He 
did not practice on Wednesday.

WR  Germane Crowell (Det) is out again this week.? Johnnie Morton and Herman  
Moore will start in his absence.

WR Corey Bradford (GB) has spent more  time on the injury report than Yancey 
Thigpen...well maybe not, but he can't  stay healthy either.? Corey misses 
another game this week as he is  officially listed as out.

WR EG Green (Ind) still has a sprained knee and  is listed as questionable on 
the injury report.? He says he will be ready  to play though.
?
*** Saturday Update WR E.G. Green (Ind) did not improve  this week and has 
been deactivated.

WR OJ McDuffie (Mia) is questionable  with a sore toe.? With Tony Martin now 
healthy, the team will likely rest  OJ so that he can heal for the playoffs.

WR Troy Brown (NE) is listed as  questionable on the injury report with a 
sore leg, but he expects to play.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Troy Brown (NE) ?was able to  do some work Saturday 
but still isn't 100%.? He'll probably be the # 3 WR  if he can go Monday.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out in likely more ways than  his listing on the injury 
report.? Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are playing  good enough to hold onto 
the starting jobs even if Jake were to get  healthy.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) is out with a bruised sternum.? Joe  Jurevicius will 
start in his place.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) gets the start  over Laveranues Coles who is out with a 
twisted knee.

WR Courtney Hawkins  (Pit) is questionable this week with a sore knee, but 
even if he played he would  likely be ineffective.? Hines Ward has been the 
only Pittsburgh receiver to  do anything consistently all year.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) is not a lock to  play, but he keeps talking like he 
will be on the field though.? He was  quoted in the Sacramento Bee as saying 
he is 85% right now.? I am guessing  he is closer to 70%, but he probably 
will play if he can handle the pain from  his turf toe.
*** Saturday Update WR Terrell Owens (SF) missed practice  again Friday and 
looks like he'll be the # 3 WR behind Jerry Rice and J.J.  Stokes.? It's 
tough not to start him as he's always got the potential to  explode but he's 
a big risk.? If you need sure points this week, I'd shy  away from him.? If 
you really need help and you're looking for a home run,  you might take a 
chance on him but just be prepared for the chance he does  little.
?
*** Saturday Update? St. Louis WRs?will likely  be playing on a less than 
optimal field in Carolina Sunday.? Besides the  grass, they're looking at 
possible snow.

WR Tony Horne (Stl) is out this week with a toe injury.

WR  Az-Zahir Hakim (Stl) is expected to play with his sore knee this week.

WR  Carl Pickens (Ten) continues to miss time with a sore hamstring.? Even 
if  he plays, he does not look like he will be a big factor.

WR Albert  Connell (Was) got a break when the doctors upgraded his 
condition.? He  remains sore though and may be a game-time decision to 
whether he plays.?  The team is starting James Thrash and Irving Fryar so he 
may have limited value  even if he suits up this week.

WR James Thrash (Was) has a bruised thigh,  but is expected to play this 
week.?  

///////////////////////////////

Tight Ends in the  News:

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is  expected to play with a 
sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) looked good in  practice later this 
week and will likely get the start.

TE Shannon Sharpe  (Bal) is on a bye this week.

TE OJ Santiago (Cle) is bothered by a sore  knee.? Fantasy players are 
bothered that he is still mentioned as a player  in the NFL.

TE Aaron Shea (Cle) is listed as questionable with sore  quadriceps.? He was 
limited in practice, but expects to play in the  game.

TE Jackie Harris (Dal) was quoted as saying he will play this  weekend.? He 
is expected to practice on Thursday and is listed as  questionable on the 
injury report with a sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update TE Jackie Harris (Dal) did practice  and looks good for 
Sunday.

TE Tony Gonzalez (KC) is perfectly fine and  just did not catch a pass last 
week from 6 attempts from Warren Moon.? If  Grbac plays, expect him to get 
the ball to Tony again.

TE Hunter Goodwin  (Mia) has a tight hamstring, but is expected to play. 

TE Johnny  McWilliams (Min) is now the starter.? John Davis still gets a lot 
of looks  though.

TE Chad Lewis (Phi) is expected to play with a sore elbow.  

///////////////////////////////

Kickers in the  News:

PK David Akers (Phi) is expected to play with a pulled  quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (Stl) looks like he will kick this week.? But  he has looked 
like he was ready before and then gave way to Jeff Hall minutes  before 
game-time.? Now that the Rams are tied for first though, expect the  players 
to start working through the pain.? I rate Wilkins chance to start  at close 
to 90% this week.

GORE CLAIMS TO WANT EVERY VOTE COUNTED, BUT REFUSES TO STOP
DEMOCRATS TRYING TO THROW OUT LEGAL VOTES FOR BUSH

Al Gore, News Conference, CNN, 11/27/00:
""Ignoring votes means ignoring democracy itself, and if we ignore
the votes of thousands in Florida in this election, how can you or
any American have confidence that your vote will not be ignored in
a future election?""

THE TRUTH:
 ~ If Gore wants all votes counted, ought to urge dismissal of
   their case.

 ~ The voters did nothing wrong - it was the result of computer
   error.  In an effort to make sure that voters received their
   ballots, local Republicans asked the Supervisor of Elections
   if they could manually fix the misprints - suit would
   disenfranchise 15,000 voters.

 ~ Democrats are trying to throw out all 15,000 absentee votes in
   Seminole County, even though less than 5,000 of the absentee
   ballot applications required correction, just to obtain a net
   gain of votes for Gore in Seminole County.

 ~ The number was on an APPLICATION, not on a ballot.

 ~ Both parties sent out materials like this.  A computer glitch
   caused approximately 5,000 Republican absentee requests to
   contain incorrect voter registration numbers.

 ~ This has NOTHING to do with the integrity of the ballots or the
   validity of votes.

LEGAL INFORMATION

 ~ No traction for the legal claim.

 ~ State law in no way bars what took place.

 ~ Merely corrected a Voter ID Number on an application.

 ~ Control on application is voter's signature and last four digits
   of Social Security Number which must be included and is provided
   by the voter.

 ~ Voter ID Numbers are public information

FLORIDA SUPREME COURT RULES THE PALM BEACH BALLOT IS LEGAL

Florida Supreme Court Ruling:
""[W]e conclude as a matter of law that the Palm Beach County
ballot does not constitute substantial noncompliance with the
statutory requirements mandating the voiding of the election.""
 - Andre Fladell v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, 12/01/00


Gore's Legal Team Insisted The Ballot Was Illegal:

Former Secretary of State And Gore Advisor Warren Christopher:
""...there are serious and substantial irregularities resulting
from the ballot...that ballot was confusing and illegal, and that
rising out of this is the need for redress in order to make sure
that the will of the people can be properly honored...""
   - News Conference on Florida Recount, CNN, 11/09/00

GORE ASKED MIAMI MAYOR WHY MIAMI-DADE RECOUNT STOPPED

Miami Herald's Manny Garcia and Joseph Tanfani, 12/01/00:
""Hours after the Miami-Dade canvassing board called off its
recount, Gore phoned county Mayor Alex Penelas (D) asking for an
explanation.  Penelas said Gore 'asked him if 'there was anything
I could do to provide extra resources' to help the count go
forward.' Penelas also said 'Gore 'never pressured me''""

Washington Post
COUNTING ON SOME SLIPPERY LANGUAGE
George F. Will
11/30/00

""...despite the supposed sophistication of Boies, Gore &
Lieberman, all its arguments have rested on two braided
assertions, each too weak to gain significant strength from the
braiding:

""First, anything done with a ballot constitutes a cast vote.
Second, no vote can be considered counted until a presidential
intent has been ascribed to it, even if the ascription involves
intuiting the meaning of 'marks...barely discernible to the
human eye' (the words of Judge Charles Burton, who presided over
Palm Beach County's recount).

""Beneath such result-oriented lawyers' artistry lurks a
pernicious premise. It is that casting a ballot is a task so
challenging for many voters that the task cannot be completed
without the intervention of lawyers-as-intuitors.  This soft
bigotry of low expectations infused Al Gore's eerie speech
Monday evening.""

HUNDREDS OF FELONS CAST VOTES ILLEGALLY: Since 1868, it has been
illegal for felons to cast ballots in Florida.
David Kidwell, Phil long and Geoff Dougherty
12/01/00

Excerpts:
""At least 445 Florida felons voted illegally on Nov. 7...

""The tainted votes -- found in a review of nearly half a million
votes cast in 12 Florida counties -- provide evidence that the
presidential race was influenced by thousands of ineligible
voters. Nearly six million voters in Florida's 67 counties cast
ballots.

""Nearly 75 percent of the illegal ballots discovered by The
Herald were cast by registered Democrats.

""The votes could be seized upon by the Bush campaign to argue
that a large number of illegal votes were probably cast for his
opponent, outweighing the effect of any recount.

""'It's a very powerful argument,' said Robert Jarvis, a law
professor at Nova Southeastern University.

""The Herald found 62 robbers, 56 drug dealers, 45 killers, 16
rapists and seven kidnappers who cast ballots. At least two who
voted are pictured on the state's online registry of sexual
offenders.

""Clarence Eden Williams, 77, of Pahokee, also voted. His picture
is posted on the state registry of sexual offenders for his
crimes against children. His son was surprised his father cast a
ballot.

""'He's got Alzheimer's, and he can't even carry on a
conversation anymore,' said Clarence Williams III.

""The Herald review included...8 percent of the 5.9 million votes
cast on Nov. 7. It encompassed all votes cast in Palm Beach and
Pasco counties, most votes cast in Duval County, and only
absentee votes in Miami-Dade, Broward, Lee, Leon, Hillsborough,
Clay and the Panhandle counties of Escambia, Okaloosa and Bay.

""To find felony voters, The Herald compared a list of voters in
those counties with a Department of Corrections database listing
felons who had served at least a year in prison. If the pattern
found in the study is the same statewide, more than 5,000 felons
likely cast illegal ballots.""

THERE IS NO MORAL EQUIVALENCY
John McIntyre
11/30/00

For the past three weeks all we have heard from Democrats and
the media about the struggle in Florida is that ""both sides are
at fault,"" ""neither candidate has been presidential,"" and ""a pox
on both your houses."" This case for moral equivalency between
Bush and Gore is critical to the Democrats' argument. If, as the
rationale goes, both sides are to blame and the election ended
in a tie, then ""why can't we just have a compromise that affords
both sides with a 50/50 chance win the Presidency?"" This would
seem like a reasonable solution, provided those underlying
suppositions were true. The problem for Gore is that the
suppositions are not even close to being true. Both sides are not
to blame. And this election, while ridiculously close, did not
end a tie.

Vice President Gore had a right to conduct a recount of the
votes. He has had that recount of votes. When the recount upheld
the original result, that should have been the end of this
fiasco. However, even before the original recount was finished,
Gore, and his partner in crime Senator Lieberman, decided in
their minds that they really won the election. What has followed
has been their all-out assault to change what happened on
election day in Florida.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Charlie Batch , QB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 12/02/00 
 Batch should be able to play next weekend against Green Bay, despite leaving 
Thursday's game against Minnesota.   ""He didn't reinjure his ribs or 
anything,"" team doctor David Collon said. ""It was too sore for him to feel he 
could play effectively, so we just gave up after the first two series.""   
Batch received numbing injections to ease pain in his ribs. Collon said no 
X-rays were necessary.    

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 12/02/00 
 Robinson was released from Northwestern Memorial Hospital on Saturday, three 
days after he was admitted for treatment of back spasms.   Robinson's status 
for Sunday night's game against Green Bay at Soldier Field was downgraded 
from questionable to doubtful. Marty Booker might start in his place, with 
Dez White also seeing increased playing time.    

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00 
 Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time 
to heal. Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth. Coach Mike Martz put 
him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to 
go for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Backup Jeff Hall will remain 
on the active roster until Sunday.   ""I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field 
goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals,"" Wilkins 
said. ""It felt great. I kicked all-out and there were no twinges, no 
tweaks.""     

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/02/00 
 Smith will start at RB at Buffalo this week. He may be a risky start, 
because hamstring injuries sometimes seem to flare up quickly again.  

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/02/00 
 Fiedler will start Sunday at Buffalo. He was sidelined by a pinched nerve in 
his neck on the first play against the New York Jets on Nov. 19. He returned 
to practice Wednesday.   ""Jay looked good today, as he has all week, so he'll 
start,"" coach Dave Wannstedt said following Friday's workout.    

 Dedric Ward , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 12/01/00 
 Ward caught six passes for 93 yards last week against the Bears. His numbers 
were likely helped due to the loss of rookie Laveranues Coles to an injury. 
Look for Ward to see some passes come his way this week against the Colts, as 
Coles will miss his second consecutive game.  Fantasy owners in deeper 
leagues may want to consider starting Ward this week.    

 Rob Johnson , QB BUF - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Johnson is listed as probable on the injury report with sore ribs, but he 
will still start this week's game against the Dolphins. He was knocked out of 
last week's game at Tampa Bay, but threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns 
before exiting. Don't expect big numbers from Johnson this week against 
Miami, whose defense ranks seventh in the league against the pass.     

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Cunningham did not practice on Thursday because of a groin strain. His 
status for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers is uncertain.  The Cowboys 
plan to use third string quarterback Anthony Wright to back up Troy Aikman if 
Cunningham isn't ready to play. At this point in the season, no Dallas 
quarterbacks should be considered for your starting lineup.    

 Panthers , DT CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Not that the Panthers have been a stellar defense for Fantasy owners this 
season, but this week may be a bad time to start Carolina.  The Panthers will 
face a Rams offense that will be pumped up and edgy with the return of QB 
Kurt Warner.  Carolina may get a few interceptions off a rusty Warner but 
look for them to struggle to score Fantasy points against the Rams.  It would 
be wise to use another defense for this week.    

 Martin Gramatica , K TB - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Look for Gramatica to pile up Fantasy points this week as the Bucs score at 
will against the Cowboys.  He is currently seventh in the NFL in scoring.  
Barring injury, he should be one of the top picks among Fantasy kickers next 
year.    

 Buccaneers , DT TB - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Look for the Buccaneers to treat QB Troy Aikman like a tackling dummy this 
Sunday.  The Cowboys have failed to protect him against adequate pass rushes 
this season so don't expect them to do any better against the T.B. sack 
machine.  The Buccaneers will be in Aikman's face all day and will force him 
into some turnovers as well.  Fantasy owners that possess the Bucs' defense 
will see them help their team in a major way this week.    

 Ryan Longwell , K GB - Ramiro Updated 12/01/00 
 Look for Longwell to have a big week against the Bears Sunday.  The Packers 
should have no problems gaining yards against the Bears but they may have 
trouble getting into the end zone, giving Longwell some kicking 
opportunities.  He has been successful when given the opportunity connecting 
on 24-of-28 FGs this season.  Look for him to score some points this week and 
be helpful, as far as Fantasy kickers go.    

 Lions , DT DET - FDIC Updated 12/01/00 
 The Lions' thinned secondary took another hit on Thursday as the team lost 
cornerback Bryant Westbrook for the remainder of the season to a torn left 
Achilles tendon. His loss will force Detroit to move nickel back Marquis 
Walker into the starting lineup.  The pass defense should be alright for the 
rest of the season though.  The pass rush has come alive recently forcing the 
QBs to rush their throws.  Detroit also has a favorable schedule with games 
against the Packers, Jets, and Bears.  Teams whose pass offense has struggle 
considerably this season.     

 Robert Holcombe , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Holcombe will start at fullback Sunday, but he will also get some carries at 
HB.  At this point in the Fantasy season he will be a good reserve back to 
have.  Just in case the Rams decide to rest Marshall Faulk in the upcoming 
weeks.    

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 So far so good for Wilkins and the Rams.  The kicker went through an intense 
kicking workout Thursday without experiencing any pain in his leg.  If he 
continues to kick without experiencing the slightest twinge he will play 
Sunday at Carolina.  Wilkins could be extremely helpful to Fantasy Owners in 
the last few weeks.  The Rams will get QB Kurt Warner back Sunday and face 
the Panthers and Vikings in their next two games.  Look for the offense to 
explode once again and give Wilkins a lot of opportunities to score points.   
 

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/01/00 
 Moore's condition has improved and he has been upgraded to probable for 
Sunday's game against the Broncos.  Moore suffered a stinger against the Rams 
last Sunday and his neck and shoulder have been sore all week.  Give Moore a 
start this Sunday.  He has been an adequate replacement for RB Ricky Williams 
and has been a nice fit behind the Saints' offensive line.      

 Jake Reed , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Reed will practice Friday for the first time since breaking his leg.  He put 
up dismal Fantasy numbers before he injured his leg.  He could be back in 
action before the regular season ends but don't count on him helping out your 
Fantasy team.    

 Aaron Stecker , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Stecker the Bucs' primary kickoff returner sat out of practice Thursday and 
is not expected to play Sunday.  Tampa has activated WR Frank Murphy from its 
practice squad with intentions of having him handle the kicks.  If returners 
are valuable in your Fantasy league it would be wise for you to pick up a 
healthy return man.    

 Macey Brooks , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Brooks missed practice Thursday due to a lower back strain and is 
questionable for Sunday's game against the Packers.  If Brooks doesn't play 
the Bears will only have four healthy receivers.  This could mean a healthy 
diet of running plays.  It would be wise for Fantasy owners to utilize 
Chicago RBs James Allen and Marlon Barnes considering the health of the Bears 
receivers and Green Bay's recent struggles with its run defense.    

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 12/01/00 
 Robinson was hospitalized for back spasms Wednesday night and still remained 
in the hospital Thursday night.  He is also suffering from a lower back 
sprain and is not expected to play against the Packers Sunday.  Marty Booker 
and rookie Dez White will alternate in Robinson's spot.  Eddie Kennison will 
probably be used as the primary receiver.  It would be wise to stay away from 
Robinson and the rest of the Chicago passing team this week.    

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Stewart had a mediocre Fantasy game Thursday carrying 15 times for 67 yards 
and a touchdown.  Look for Stewart to have a better game against the Packers 
next week.  The Packers defensive line is thin without DT Santana Dotson. 
They allowed Carolina rookie Brad Hoover to romp through their front for 117 
yards Monday.     

 Stoney Case , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Case entered Thursday night's game for Detroit, replacing starter Charlie 
Batch who left after re-aggravating a rib injury. Playing for the injured 
Batch, Case completed 23-of-33 passes for 230 yards with one touchdown and 
one interception, and also ran six times for 62 yards. Case might not be a 
bad acquisition at this point of the season. If Batch can't play next week it 
would be best to plug in his backup. Batch may be the better winner, but 
Case's running ability makes him the better Fantasy QB.    

 Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 The rookie wideout put up the best numbers in a game laced with talented 
receivers.  He caught eight passes for 106 yards and a late touchdown.  Don't 
rush out and try to acquire Foster though.  His numbers were probably more a 
product of his chemistry with fellow second-stringer, QB Stoney Case, who 
filled in for the injured Charlie Batch.  Foster seemed to be Case's first 
throwing option.  When Batch returns Foster will probably be the third option 
again.    

 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/01/00 
 Culpepper had a boring Fantasy performance against the Lions Thursday.  He 
threw a touchdown and two interceptions while completing 19-of-32 passes for 
160 yards.  Expect bigger and better numbers for Culpepper when he faces the 
Rams next week in what will probably the biggest offensive explosion of the 
season.      

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Fear Updated 12/01/00 
 Carter caught seven passes for 45 yards Thursday, including a four-yard 
second quarter touchdown for his 1,000th career  catch.  It was a milestone 
night for Carter but a forgettable one for Fantasy owners.  His numbers 
weren't too spectacular.  Look for him to put up better numbers against the 
Rams and their generous defense next week.    

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/01/00 
 The Lions managed to put the clamps on the star wideout Thursday.  He was 
held to 26 yards on three catches.  Don't worry Fantasy owners.  If your team 
is still in the playoff hunt Moss will make up for his performance next week 
against the Rams.  He is just too talented to be shut down in consecutive 
games.      

 Robert Smith , RB MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/01/00 
 Smith ran for two touchdowns and 117 yards on 17 carries Thursday night, 
including a 43-yard fourth-quarter TD run that sealed the game for 
Minnesota.  If you have Smith on your Fantasy team he may very well seal a 
Fantasy championship for your team.  He is without a doubt the hottest 
Fantasy back right now.    

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 Although McNair is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury report for 
Sunday's game in Philadelphia, he is expected to get the start. His thumb is 
still sore and he's been icing it regularly, but it's not expected to keep 
him from playing. Still, the Eagles have a solid defense and the Titans' 
passing game has struggled of late, so you might want to consider starting 
someone else this week.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 George did not practice yesterday in order to rest his injured right big 
toe, although he and Coach Jeff Fisher said he could have participated. 
Fisher wants George to be able to fully participate in today's session, and 
expects he will be able to. Considering George has held up this well through 
a variety of injuries in recent weeks, there's little reason to expect he 
won't start Sunday in his return to Philadelphia and post solid Fantasy 
numbers.  

 Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Ward is listed as probable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game 
against Oakland. With Pittsburgh's receivers hurting, expect him to play and 
be the focus of the passing game. He's still marginal as a Fantasy producer, 
though.

replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow.   =20

 Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00=20
 Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee,=
=20
during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had=
=20
surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, bu=
t=20
returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluation=
s=20
performed on Tuesday. Duncan, who leads the Spurs in both scoring and=20
rebounding, is one of the most coveted stars in all of Fantasy.    =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will underg=
o=20
surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expecte=
d=20
to miss 6-8 weeks.  Fantasy owners who had Snow on their roster would be wi=

to check their league's free agent list in order to replace him. If no viab=

alternatives are available, look to make a trade to bolster your lineup.  =
=20

 Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is=
=20
listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 reboun=
ds=20
per game, Austin has very little Fantasy value. =20

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Dickerson left Monday's game against the Rockets in the first quarter afte=
r=20
aggravating a foot injury that he sustained during training camp. Head Coac=

Sidney Lowe said that Dickerson's condition will be evaluated on Tuesday.=
=20
Fantasy owners who just got Dickerson back must now hold their breath once=
=20
again and hope his latest injury isn't seroius.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/12/00=20
 In his first game back from injury, Hill led the Magic with 19 points in a=
=20
surprising 92-80 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He added seven rebounds=
=20
and four assists in only 25 minutes of play. Hill shot 7-of-10 from the=20
field, and looked like he is almost all the way back from his ankle injury =
-=20
which should make his Fantasy owners very happy to have him back in their=
=20
lineup.   =20

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him =

miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center.  =
He=20
will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of h=

league that goess by averages but it could be a problem in leagues that go =

total points.    =20

 Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for=20
Monday's showdown at Utah.  Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if=20
Johnson is unable to play.  Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of=
=20
his speed and hinder his Fantasy production.  Bench Johnson for a while if=
=20
possible.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon. =
=20
Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by De=

20 ""at the latest"".  This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up=

Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy=
=20
when he returns before you pick him up.   =20

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When h=
e=20
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the=
=20
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a=
=20
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you=
=20
to let him go.   =20

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00=20
 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised=
=20
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't=
=20
played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want t=
o=20
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.   =
=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a=20
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to=
=20
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one =
of=20
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game t=
o=20
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy=
=20
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns=
=20
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.   =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game=20
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading=20
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has=
=20
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00=20
 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the=
=20
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of=20
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two=20
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per=20
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill shou=
ld=20
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis i=
n=20
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until=20
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major=20
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5=
=20
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another=
=20
viable option is open to you.   =20

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the=20
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't=
=20
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The=20
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scori=
ng=20
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to tho=
se=20
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit=
=20
Atkins if your roster allows it.   =20

 Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surger=
y=20
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured=
=20
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game=20
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland=20
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Mill=
er=20
and Brevin Knight.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00=20
 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games wi=
th=20
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in=20
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights=
=20
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes=
=20
occur. =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions=
=20
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on t=
he=20
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reported=
ly=20
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have=
=20
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will=
=20
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was=20
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who ha=
s=20
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive=
=20
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.  =20

 Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over =

month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a ""leave"" by the te=
am=20
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds =
in=20
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is=20

I guess you just summed up the difference between our two programs - at Texas 
we play for National Championships  at LSU you play to make the Sharpie 
Independence bowl.  Yes we were rated in the top 10 at the beginning of the 
year and yes we are rated #20 now.  You forget that we are only half way 
through the season - we will be in the top 10 again before the year is out.  
Where will LSU be?  Besides we weren't supossed to play in the Orange Bowl 
this year ( this is only Mack Brown's 3rd year), but anything less than the 
Rose Bowl nest year will be dissapointing.

See you in Pasadena 2002

Easy there Superfan!  Remember, you still have to win 1 of your last 3 games, 
none of those are gimmes (see UAB).  As far as bowls go,  LSU to the Cotton 
Bowl? Come on, the Sharpie Independence Bowl is more likely (although UT will 
probably join you).  In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were 
lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense.  
Besides, we have turned the corner after our embarrassing loss to OU (the #2 
team in the country). I feel pretty good about our chances the rest of the 
way. 

 Face it, the SEC is having a down year.  It happens to all Conferences.  
It's just that this down year has enabled LSU a few chances to tear down the 
goalposts (and against the #11 team in the country - how sad is that).  

 And far be it from me to defend the Aggies, but which school was the one to 
back out of that contract a few years back?

See you in the Shreveport.

UT - 58
LSU - 3

There are some pretty interesting college football predictions flying around! 
After their incredible victory last Saturday night, some folks have LSU going 
to the Cotton Bowl this year.  I would love to see LSU sweep UT this year in 
yet one more major college sport-------basketball (NCAA tournament), baseball 
(College World Series), and, yes, football in the Cotton Bowl this year.  
However, it would be just as sweet to wip up on our old football 
nemesis---The Aggies.  Although I think the Tigers would have to be a little 
more careful, since the Aggies occasionally spice up their offense with a 
crazy ""REEEEEEEE-Verse"" play or maybe even a pass on first down.

We can only hope that one of these situations occur!

Once the commissioner enters the matchups, all owners can
view them on the Schedule, Playoffs page.


CONSOLATION MATCHUPS DURING PLAYOFF WEEKS

non-playoff teams on the sidelines? Commissioners can set
not only the playoff matchups, but consolation matchups as
well, under the Schedule, Matchups link in the Front
Office.


PLAYOFF INFORMATION

Go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoff
tournament starts and how many rounds it lasts. If you were
lucky "" make that skillful "" enough to make the playoffs,
go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams

Take a break from pre-game trash talking and let our ""guru""
have a say. Go to Schedule, CommGuru for a ""tale of the

Thank you for signing your petition to certify the election
at ElectionIntegrity2000.com.

Like many Americans, I'm sure you're trying to get the most
accurate, up-to-the-minute information about what's
happening down in Florida.  But can you really trust the
information you get from the liberal media?

In fact, the liberal media has been behind this election
controversy from the beginning.

That's why I'm passing on to you this letter I received
from my friend Jim Roberts at Radio America.

Radio America is doing something about this attempt by the
liberal media to hijack the election.  I urge you to take
just a minute to read Jim's letter and to listen to Radio
America over the internet for unbiased election coverage.

For Election Integrity,
Bruce Eberle

---------------------------------------------------------
To: Bruce Eberle
From: Jim Roberts
Subject: Unbiased media coverage of the election...
---------------------------------------------------------

Dear Bruce,

The liberal media is at it again.

They used every trick in the book to try to help Al Gore win
on election night.

And following a vote that didn't come out the way the
liberal media wanted it to... the media used their massive
influence to drum up controversy in Florida to try to
overturn the whole election.

On election night, the network media shamefully tried to
influence the election by declaring Al Gore the winner in
Florida before the polls were closed in that state -- and
hours before the polls were closed in the rest of the
country.

And the media all but declared Gore to be the overall winner
based on his ""win"" in Florida and other early states.

This clearly biased move led to thousands of discouraged
George W. Bush voters in Florida and other swing states to
leave long poll lines BEFORE they voted.

Who knows what the outcome might have been in Florida and
other swing states such as New Mexico, Oregon, and
California if the media had not falsely declared Gore to be
Florida's winner so early.

And then the media tried to overturn the most crucial swing
state -- Florida -- by inventing controversy and scandal
there.

The liberal media has always been biased...

.. but never before have they so blatantly tried to rig an
election in favor of their liberal candidate.

And who knows what tricks they may still have up their
sleeve to overturn the election and put Al Gore in the
White House.

Believe me, until the last Gore lawsuit is dismissed, the
liberal media will cling to the hope of getting their man
elected despite the actual outcome of the election.

That's why Radio America is so important.

Radio America is the one national media source that is
giving truthful, unbiased election information.

Radio America is a non-profit radio network that broadcasts
nationwide 24 hours a day.  We represent the views of
Americans like you.  That's why we're called ""The Voice of
Main Street America.""

During all the controversy and confusion surrounding this
election, you can count on Radio America to cut through the
liberal bias and broadcast the truth.

And now you can listen to Radio America on-line over your
computer.

That's right, you can hear our unbiased, no-nonsense news
and reporting over the internet 24 hours a day.

To find out how you can listen to Radio America, just click
on the link below.

Please don't let the liberal news media go unopposed.

For America,
Jim Roberts, President of Radio America

P.S. This is vitally important for the future of America.
Please forward this e-mail to anyone you know who cares
about saving this election from being stolen by the liberal
media!

Chicago Bears have informed NFLtalk that wide receiver Marcus Robinson
suffered a lower back strain with muscle spasms in practice yesterday. He
was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment and observation
last night and was evaluated by Bears team orthopedist Michael Schafer.
Robinson is listed on the Bears injury report as questionable for this

More as I hear it but right now it's not looking too good.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 Although McNair is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury report for 
Sunday's game in Philadelphia, he is expected to get the start. His thumb is 
still sore and he's been icing it regularly, but it's not expected to keep 
him from playing. Still, the Eagles have a solid defense and the Titans' 
passing game has struggled of late, so you might want to consider starting 
someone else this week.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 George did not practice yesterday in order to rest his injured right big 
toe, although he and Coach Jeff Fisher said he could have participated. 
Fisher wants George to be able to fully participate in today's session, and 
expects he will be able to. Considering George has held up this well through 
a variety of injuries in recent weeks, there's little reason to expect he 
won't start Sunday in his return to Philadelphia and post solid Fantasy 
numbers.  

 Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Ward is listed as probable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game 
against Oakland. With Pittsburgh's receivers hurting, expect him to play and 
be the focus of the passing game. He's still marginal as a Fantasy producer, 
though.  

 Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 The Steelers will be without Burress likely for the remainder of the season 
after learning he has a torn ligament and two broken bones in his right 
wrist. He said he originally sustained the injury during the season opener, 
but played the next 11 games despite constant pain in the wrist. Burress had 
it X-rayed and placed in a cast after practice yesterday, and it will require 
surgery. With him out, Courtney Hawkins will continue to start in his place 
for the next four games.  

 Jamel White , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Browns have listed White as questionable with a shoulder injury for 
Sunday's game against Jacksonville. He has performed fairly well spelling 
fellow rookie Travis Prentice in recent weeks, and may earn himself 
consideration in the Browns' RB plans for 2001. He won't provide you with 
much this season, though.  

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/30/00 
 The Jaguars will be without linebackers Hardy Nickerson, who has a knee 
injury, and Erik Storz, who has a broken thumb, as well as safety Erik Olson, 
who has an ankle injury, for Sunday's game against the Browns. Fortunately, 
linebackers Lonnie Marts, listed as probable after missing four games with a 
groin injury, and Kevin Hardy, probable with an ankle injury, are both 
expected to play. Despite all the injuries, keep in mind that this might be 
the best week to start the Jacksonville defense, as it faces a Cleveland 
offense that has been decimated by injuries.   

 Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 ""The Green Lantern"" had his light burned out last week against the Bears, 
catching only one pass for eight yards in the entire game. After four solid 
weeks, Chrebet has caught only four passes for 41 yards over his last two 
games. He faces off against a Colts' secondary that he burned for eight 
catches and 140 yards receiving in Week Ten, so a productive day is certainly 
not out of the question. Although he hasn't been overly consistent, Chrebet 
will likely find his way onto many starting lineups as the playoffs begin.    

 Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Shea is listed as questionable with a thigh muscle injury for Sunday's game 
in Jacksonville. If he can't play, either Mark Campbell, who served as the 
starter last Sunday, or O.J. Santiago would be the tight end. Even if he's 
healthy, Shea isn't going to carry your Fantasy team through the playoffs.  

 Richie Anderson , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Anderson continued to be the Jets' secret weapon last week, catching six 
passes for 69 yards and a score against the Bears. Although Anderson's 
numbers have been commendable between the lines, his value in the world of 
Fantasy isn't as solid. Unless you are involved in a deeper league, avoid 
playing Anderson during your Fantasy playoffs.      

 O.J. Santiago , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Santiago is listed as questionable with a knee injury for the Browns' game 
in Jacksonville on Sunday. If he can't go, Mark Campbell would be the backup 
tight end, and if Aaron Shea is also out, then Marc Edwards would serve as 
Campbell's backup for the second straight game. We don't recommend any of the 
Browns' tight ends.  

 Bernie Parmalee , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Parmalee has been surprisingly productive over the past two weeks while 
splitting time with Curtis Martin, who has been less than 100 percent after 
injuring his gluteus maximus. Parmalee caught six passes and accounted for 74 
yards of total offense in last week's win over Chicago.  Starting Parmalee in 
the playoffs, however, is extremely risky, so stick with Martin or look to 
another option if possible.    

 Doug Pederson , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Browns Coach Chris Palmer hasn't made a final decision on who will start at 
quarterback Sunday against Jacksonville, although if Pederson's bruised ribs 
don't heal in time, it would make the decision an easy one. Pederson was held 
out of throwing drills yesterday and will probably be limited the rest of the 
week, and looks to be a gametime decision. Palmer may opt to use rookie 
Spergon Wynn this week either way. Considering the Browns' struggles in the 
passing game added to this quarterback controversy, Pederson isn't going to 
help Fantasy owners during the playoffs.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 According to The Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals are planning on 
evaluating Mitchell over the next few games in hopes that he will re-sign to 
compete with Akili Smith for the starting QB job next season. Team president 
Mike Brown made the statements after watching Mitchell participate in his 
first practice in 10 days yesterday. Mitchell is expected to start Sunday 
against Arizona after missing last Sunday's game with a sprained knee 
ligament. Despite a weak Cardinals' defense, we don't recommend him for your 
league's playoff run.   

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Mean Machine Updated 11/30/00 
 Sanders is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Bengals 
with a quadricep injury.  The injury certainly hasn't helped his numbers - he 
has caught only five passes for 63 yards in his last two games.  Avoid 
starting Sanders if at all possible, especially during the playoffs.  He is 
far too inconsistent to play at such a crucial stage of your Fantasy 
season.     

 David Boston , WR ARI - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 Boston caught only one pass for 32 yards in last week's loss to the Giants.  
He has been hampered by a nagging hamstring injury of late, which hasn't help 
his numbers in recent weeks.  He has had only one game with more than 90 
yards receiving in the last six weeks, and has scored only once in that same 
span. If the Cards' enemic offense is ever going to score, however, it could 
be against the Bengals. Unless you have more solid receivers on your roster, 
starting Boston simply on this week's matchup isn't a bad move.     

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Hearst is listed as questionable on the injury report but won't be of any 
help to a Fantasy team this season.  He was recently activated from the 
injury list after missing most 1999 and 2000 with an ankle injury.    

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/30/00 
 Moore has been downgraded to questionable on the injury report.  He suffered 
a shoulder stinger in Sunday's game against St. Louis.  If he is unable to 
play Chad Morton and Terry Allen will handle the carries.  The Saints have 
been able to run on every team they have played this season no matter who 
their RB is.  But if you are going to use a New Orleans back go with Morton 
who is the healthiest and most explosive of the bunch.    

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 Jones could see some increased playing time now that the season is coming to 
a close, but he will still have little impact for Fantasy owners at this 
point in the season. Jones' rookie campaign has been a real disappointment, 
and he should have been a casuality for owners much earlier in the year.  

 Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Ramiro Updated 11/30/00 
 Pittman had a huge game against the Giants last week, catching ten passes 
while compiling 193 yards of total offense. He also scored the Cardinals' 
only touchdown of the game on a 36-yard pass from Dave Brown. Pittman will 
face a Cincinnati defense this week that ranks 24th in the league against the 
run, so he could be in line for another strong performance. The only thing 
that Fantasy owners who have Pittman on their roster should worry about is if 
Arizona decides to give rookie Thomas Jones more playing time now that the 
season is winding down.   

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Rams are expected to decide on Thursday whether or not Wilkins is 
healthy enough to play.  He will undergo an extensive kicking routine and 
will be evaluated from thereafter.  Wilkins has missed the past few games 
because of a quadriceps injury.  

 Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Mean Machine Updated 11/30/00 
 Hayes practiced Wednesday and will likely play in Sunday's game against the 
Rams.  He missed Monday's game against the Rams due to a groin injury.  Hayes 
hasn't been a star by no means this season but he has been helpful to Fantasy 
teams.    

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - The Rounders Updated 11/30/00 
 It looks like rookie Brad Hoover will start at RB again this Sunday for the 
Panthers.  Biakabutuka has been sidelined for the past few weeks by turf 
toe.  He was initally listed as probable for Sunday's home game against the 
Rams but left practice early Wednesday after experiencing pain in his toe.  
""I'd say right now his status is probably a little more questionable than I 
thought it would be,"" head coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer . 
 It would be wise to keep Biakabutuka out of your lineup.  Although Hoover 
had a good game this week it might even be safer to use a more proven back on 
your Fantasy team.    

 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 Wheatley practiced on Wednesday and is listed as probable for this week's 
game against the Steelers. Head Coach Jon Gruden said that Wheatley moved 
around well during the workout, so expect the Raiders' back to be ready to 
play. Wheatley has proven that he has a high tolerance for pain, so even if 
he isn't 100 percent for the Pittsburgh game, Fantasy owners can rest assured 
that he will play.     

 Herbert Goodman , RB GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Packers have activated Goodman from their practice squad.  He had played 
in five games this season before being placed on the practice team on 
November 1.  He is used primarily on special teams and will be of little use 
to a Fantasy team at this point in the year.   

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 After missing most of the season because of a broken leg, Bradford is now 
recovering from torn cartilage in his right knee.  He still hopes to return 
for a December 10 game against the Lions.  Right now he is having trouble 
pushing off on his knee.  Stay away from Bradford in your Fantasy league 
until next season.     

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/30/00 
 Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England.  Although he is still listed as 
questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is 
optimistic. ""Right now, I'd say he'll play,"" said Cunningham, ""but we'll see 
what (today) brings."" Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it 
would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - 
especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning.    

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Smith's injured right hamstring has made significant progress since he 
missed last week's game against the Colts, and the Dolphins are cautiously 
optimistic that he  could return for this week's game against Buffalo. 
Despite experiencing a slight ""tweak"" in the hamstring after Wednesday's 
practice, Smith still believes he will be ready to go. ""I feel fine,"" Smith 
said, ""I have no pain in my leg. I'm running and cutting without any pain.""  
Those Fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation, however,  would be 
wise to steer clear of Smith this week. Playing in the cold at Buffalo could 
hinder Smith's performance, which is a chance you won't want to take at this 
point of the season.     

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Contrary to earlier reports, the Dolphins are now ""optimistic"" that Fiedler 
will be their starting quarterback for this week's game against Buffalo. He 
took 75 percent of the snaps with the first team during Wednesday's practice 
and reported that he felt fine. It would be a remarkable recovery for 
Fielder, who couldn't even raise his right arm on Sunday. ""If he's OK 
(today), he's starting,"" said Head Coach Dave Wannstedt. Even if he does 
start, Fielder isn't a very strong option for Fantasy owners who have 
advanced to their league's playoffs.     

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Enis has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season.  Where have we heard 
this before? During the offseason Enis bulked up to 250 pounds and promised 
to run over the opposition.  He looked slow carrying the ball this season and 
was replaced at HB by James Allen.  With HB Marlon Barnes and Allen in tow, 
Enis may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere.  He is down to 242 
pounds already and would like to reach 235.  Even if he does reach this goal 
don't count on him being too productive.  Wait and see if he re-emerges as a 
star before you gamble and put him on your Fantasy team next year.     

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 McNown is listed as questionable but will be the emergency QB for sunday's 
game against the Bears, behind Shane Matthews and backup Mark Hartsell.  It 
appears that McNown is done for the Fantasy season.  His seperated shoulder 
rendered him helpless for the latter part of 2000,  but even when he was 
healthy he didn't produce too much.    

More Updates 

 Player News?Teams? 
 Meximullets Player News 

 Charlie Garner , Active RB Updated 11/13/00 
Garner emerged from a two-week slump by gaining 102 yards on 25 carries and 
scoring a touchdown. Look for Garner to have a big game next week against a 
thin Atlanta Falcons defense. 

 Antonio Freeman , Active WR Updated 11/22/00 
Freeman had a relatively quiet game Sunday against the Colts catching only 
three passes for 37 yards. He did manage to haul in a 17-yard TD pass from 
Brett Favre. No. 2 receiver Bill Schroeder won't have the game that he had 
last week, which will allow the mediocre Panthers' secondary to focus on 
stopping Freeman. His numbers will improve this week but only slightly. 

 Skip Hicks , Reserve RB Updated 10/17/00 
Hicks saw limited action in Sunday's game against the Ravens. He rushed three 
times for seven yards and caught one pass for five yards. Unless Stephen 
Davis goes down, Hicks won't see much action. 

 Amani Toomer , Active WR Updated 11/29/00 
Toomer accounted for 89 yards of total offense and a touchdown in last Sunday 
night's 31-7 win over Arizona. He will face off against a talented Redskins' 
secondary this week that held him to only three catches and 31 yards in the 
team's first meeting. If your other wideouts have more favorable matchups 
this week, it might be wise to bench Toomer. 

 Justin Watson , Reserve RB Updated 11/13/00 
Watson fared better in his second start for Marshall Faulk Sunday. He gained 
62 yards on 17 carries. 

 Shawn Bryson , Reserve RB Updated 11/17/00 
With the injury to Sammy Morris, it looks as though Bryson will get the start 
this week against the Chiefs. If Morris has been one of your main tailbacks 
this season, it may be a good idea to pick up Bryson if he is still 
available. 

 Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 11/27/00 
Torry Holt caught six passes for 89 yards against the Saints Sunday. Look for 
Holt to put up similar numbers against the Panthers Sunday. 

 Donovan McNabb , Reserve QB Updated 11/27/00 
McNabb was McNasty against Washington, accounting for 262 yards of total 
offense and two touchdowns in the Eagles' 23-20 win at FedEx Field. He put 
the offensive unit on his shoulders and single-handedly kept Philadelphia in 
first place in the NFC East. Up next, McNabb will face a tough Tennessee 
squad who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the Jaguars. Don't expect 
huge numbers from McNabb this week, but do expect him to be the focal point 
of Philadelphia's offense once again. 

 Kyle Brady , Active TE Updated 10/30/00 
Brady finally found the end zone, scoring a touchdown in what was a career 
game for him against Dallas Sunday. Just one week after an eight-catch, 
111-yard performance against Washington, Brady broke loose for 10 catches for 
138 yards. Keep in mind that he's been getting opportunities lately due to 
the injury to Jimmy Smith, so his numbers shouldn't remain so extraordinary, 
but Mark Brunell will likely look to his tight end more often in the future. 

 Gary Anderson , Active K Updated 11/29/00 
Anderson continued his accuracy this season by making both of his attempts on 
Thanksgiving Day. He has made 20-of-21 attempts this season and is quietly 
having a year similar to the one he had in 1998 when he was perfect in the 
regular season. However, he is old and doesn't kick the long ones like he 
used to. Anderson won't go beyond 50 yards anymore but is pinpoint from 30-49 
yards. Look for him to add a few more field goals against the Lions this 
week. 

 Stephen Davis , Active RB Updated 11/28/00 
Head Coach Norv Turner has indicated that Davis should be ready to play in 
this week's pivotal NFC East matchup against the Giants. Davis missed last 
week's game against the Eagles with a hairline fracture of his right forearm. 
The return of Davis is great news for Fantasy players who own his rights, 
especially with the playoffs just around the corner. 

 Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 11/29/00 
Head coach Steve Mariucci is considering giving Garcia's backups Rick Mirer 
and Tim Rattay some playing time at the end of games to evaluate their 
standing with the team. This won't hurt Garcia's production too much but 
could cost him a few cheap TDs at the end of games. ""We've talked about it,"" 
Mariucci told the Contra Costa Times . ""I wouldn't mind Rick Mirer playing a 
little bit, either. ... If a situation presented itself when you could put 
your third guy (Rattay) in there without hurting the football team, I guess 
we would consider that."" 

 Bill Schroeder , Reserve WR Updated 11/20/00 
The Packers' wideout had what might have been his best game of the season 
against the Colts Sunday, racking up 155 yards on eight catches. He won't 
continue to post numbers like this, but look for Schroeder to have some 
success against the Panthers this Sunday. 

 Darnell Autry , Reserve RB Updated 11/27/00 
On nine carries, Autry gained just 25 yards. If you start him at anytime 
during the Fantasy playoffs, you may be risking your season. 

 Marcus Robinson , Reserve WR Updated 11/29/00 
Not having QB Cade McNown throw to him has really hurt Robinson's numbers. 
While playing with McNown in his first six games this season, Robinson had 32 
receptions for 506 yards (15.8 average) and four touchdowns. In his last five 
contests, Robinson has just 23 catches for 232 yards (10.1 yards), with one 
touchdown. Except for one quarter against the Eagles, Jim Miller and Shane 
Matthews were the quarterbacks in those ballgames. McNown is still another 
week or so away from playing so look for Robinson to continue to struggle. 

 Ravens , Reserve DT Updated 11/27/00 
Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming 
the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted 
yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its 
record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just 
seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, 
an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to 
say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore 
has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense 
during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and 
Arizona coming off the bye. 

 Redskins , Active DT Updated 11/17/00 
The 'Skins expect to have both cornerback Darrell Green and outside 
linebacker Shawn Barber back for Washington's Monday night tilt with the 
Rams. Green has missed three games with a strained calf muscle, while Barber 
has missed two games with a sprained MCL in his right knee. Washington will 
need a big performance from their defense on Monday night if they are to have 
any chance at beating the champs in the dome.

over 24 hours we have collected 100,000 signed letters
to Al Gore urging him to concede. But let's not stop
there!

We need to put more pressure on Al Gore. Below is an
e-mail that can forwarded to all of your friends and
relatives -- anyone who is interested in preserving
the integrity of this election.

Spread the Word!

============================================================

Dear Friend,

Al Gore is flatly refusing to accept the fair and just
election results.  Instead, he is pursuing a calculated
course of action intended to overturn the will of the voters
and the CERTIFIED election results.  Included in these
actions are his attempts to attack and discredit military
absentee votes cast for George W. Bush while simultaneously
using manipulative ""hand-counting"" techniques to convert
so-called ""dimpled chads"" into votes for Gore.

This is not fair, it is not right, and the American people
won't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent by
Al Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf.

What Gore is doing is WRONG.  And every day that he continues
to contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or in
the media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers
an overwhelming majority of American citizens.

In order to make this point clear to Mr. Gore, Election
Integrity 2000 is collecting online letters to send to Al
Gore urging him to concede the election NOW!

Please go to http://www.electionintegrity.com/home/g349.cfm
 to sign your letter to Al Gore right now.

Al Gore always claims to be ""listening to the will of the
people.""  The fact is, WE are the people, and he is about to
hear from us in a big way.

PLEASE forward this urgent e-mail to every friend who might
be interested in sending a message to Al Gore that America
wants him to concede.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=

of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=

service during this transition.=20
=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=

phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=

selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=

QB Jake Plummer (Ari) should get the start although he is still
hurting a tad with thumb and rib injuries.  He is listed as probable
on the injury report.  His backup Dave Brown is questionable with a
shoulder injury.

QB Doug Johnson (Atl) has been named the starter for the rest of the
season.

QB Trent Dilfer (Bal) is on a bye this week.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is expected to start with sore ribs.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is making excellent progress, but he will likely
miss again this week.  Shane Matthews is expected to get the start
this week.  Cade is listed as questionable with a sore shoulder.  He
would probably play if Matthews were to get hurt.

QB Scott Mitchell (Cin) is expected to return as the starter despite
a sore knee.  He practiced on Wednesday.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) did not throw on Wednesday as he nurses his
ribs.  The team has not yet named a starter and if he can not go will
look to Spergon Wynn to lead there team into the slaughter.  Either
way, look for Jacksonville's defense to look good in this contest.

QB Clint Stoerner was signed by Dallas this week.

QB Brian Griese (Den) is slated to return the last week of the NFL
season at the earliest.  Gus Frerotte will start in his absence.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) was able to practice Tuesday and is expected
to take the field with his sore ribs.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) practiced on Wednesday, but is still questionable
whether he will start.  The coaching staff has yet to name a
starter.  I rate his chances at 85% to start.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) was able to practice Wednesday and now looks
like he will start this Sunday.  He is listed as questionable on the
injury report with a sore shoulder and neck.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) continues to take a pounding.  He appears as
questionable on the injury report again with a  sore thumb and a
bruised ego.  He missed practice on Tuesday, but typically plays
hurt.  If he can not go, look for John Friesz (and his less than 100%
knee) to take the field.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) is turning quite a few heads with his stellar
play.   He starts again this week.

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit) is probable with a sore calf, but expects to
start.

QB Jerome Bettis (Pit) has a sore leg, but it will take a lot more
than that to keep him off the field.

QB Moses Moreno (SD) needs to trade away a commandment or two for a
more durable body.  He appears on the injured list again as
questionable with a sore knee.  Ryan Leaf, who has a sore groin,
will start again in his place.

QB Jon Kitna (Sea) gets the start this week for the injured Brock
Huard.  Brock is out indefinitely with a bruised kidney and was just
released from the hospital earlier this week.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) took snaps and has looked great throwing in
practice.  He will start this week.  Trent Green will back him up.

QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on Wednesday and looks to start against
the Cowboys.  Eric Zeier would play if Shaun king suffered a set-back.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on Wednesday and looks to start this
week.  He is listed as questionable on the injury report with a hurt
thumb.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is back behind center while Jeff George
watches.  I doubt we have seen the last of this controversy.

////////////////////////////////

Running backs in the News:

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo (Bal) is gone for the season.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal) is on a bye this week.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf) was able to practice briefly on Wednesday and
is questionable for this week's game.  He is having trouble
making the hard cuts so will likely be ineffective even if he plays.

RB William Floyd (Car) will miss this game.

RB Tim Biakabutuka (Car) likely returns to the lineup this week. He
is listed as probable with a sore toe.

RB Jamel White (Cle) is banged up with a sore shoulder.  Look for
Travis Prentice to ""shoulder"" more of the load this week.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal) has shaken off the concussion and will start
this week.

RB Terrell Davis (Den) is out this week with calf problems.  Mike
Anderson gets the start again this week.

RB Detron Smith (Den) can play if needed with his sore thumb.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) misses yet another game.  Ahman Green will get
the start.

RB Lamar Smith (Mia) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to be the
starter despite being listed as questionable on the injury report
with a tender hamstring.

RB Jimmy Kleinsasser (Min) is probable with a sore hamstring.

RB JR Redmond (NE) appears as questionable on the injury report with
bruised ribs, but he expects to play.

RB Ricky Williams (NO) is healing way ahead of schedule.  He may now
be ready for the last game of the regular season.  His cast is
expected to come off later this week.

RB Jerald Moore (NO) is listed as questionable on the injury report
with a sore neck.  He is still expected to start though, but Chad
Morton may see a few more reps than usual.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) plans on playing through the pain.  He is
listed as probable with a sore gluteous.  I am guessing he is the
butt of many New York jokes.

RB Leon Johnson has been re-signed by the Jets and will return punts.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is banged up with a sore knee and finger,
but his ankles are better.  He will play this week.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this week and he is using
the time to look for personalized items with his last name.  We will
keep you posted.

RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as questionable with a sore hamstring.
On a team that already has a crowded backfield with Jermaine Fazande
and Terrell Fletcher, Kenny looks like he could be placed on the
inactive list this week.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) has a broken rib, but is expected to play
with the pain.

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) is listed as questionable on the injury
report, but is doubtful he would have played anyway.  The team
remains cautious in his comeback.

RB Mike Alstott (TB) will not play this week.  Look for Warrick Dunn
to get plenty of opportunities against a soft Dallas defense.

RB Eddie George (Ten) skipped Wednesday's practice, but expects
to practice today and play this weekend.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is listed as questionable with a sore knee.

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will play with his sore forearm.  Look for the
Giants to attempt to arm-tackle him all day.

///////////////////////////////////

Wide Receivers in the News:

WR Frank Sanders (Ari) is expected to play with a sore leg.

WR Brian Finneran (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to
play with a sore back.

WR Qadry Ismail (Bal) is on a bye this week.

WR Jermaine Lewis (Bal) will use this week to heal his shoulder he
injured in last week's game.

WR Peerless Price (Buf) is expected to play with a sore ankle.

WR Donald Hayes (Car) is expected to start with a sore groin.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle) is listed as questionable with a sore
knee.  He did not practice on Wednesday.

WR Germane Crowell (Det) is out again this week.  Johnnie Morton and
Herman Moore will start in his absence.

WR Corey Bradford (GB) has spent more time on the injury report than
Yancey Thigpen=01(=01(=01(well maybe not, but he can't stay healthy
either.
Corey misses another game this week as he is officially listed as out.

WR EG Green (Ind) still has a sprained knee and is listed as
questionable on the injury report.  He says he will be ready to play
though.

WR OJ McDuffie (Mia) is questionable with a sore toe.  With Tony
Martin now healthy, the team will likely rest OJ so that he can heal
for the playoffs.

WR Troy Brown (NE) is listed as questionable on the injury report
with a sore leg, but he expects to play.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out in likely more ways than his listing on the
injury report.  Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are playing good enough
to hold onto the starting jobs even if Jake were to get healthy.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) is out with a bruised sternum.  Joe Jurevicius
will start in his place.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) gets the start over Laveranues Coles who is out
with a twisted knee.

WR Courtney Hawkins (Pit) is questionable this week with a sore knee,
but even if he played he would likely be ineffective.  Hines Ward has
been the only Pittsburgh receiver to do anything consistently all
year.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) is not a lock to play, but he keeps talking
like he will be on the field though.  He was quoted in the Sacramento
Bee as saying he is 85% right now.  I am guessing he is closer to
70%, but he probably will play if he can handle the pain from his
turf toe.

WR Tony Horne (Stl) is out this week with a toe injury.

WR Az-Zahir Hakim (Stl) is expected to play with his sore knee this
week.

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) continues to miss time with a sore hamstring.
Even if he plays, he does not look like he will be a big factor.

WR Albert Connell (Was) got a break when the doctors upgraded his
condition.  He remains sore though and may be a game-time decision to
whether he plays.  The team is starting James Thrash and Irving Fryar
so he may have limited value even if he suits up this week.

WR James Thrash (Was) has a bruised thigh, but is expected to play
this week.

///////////////////////////////

Tight Ends in the News:

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to play
with a sore knee.

TE Shannon Sharpe (Bal) is on a bye this week.

TE OJ Santiago (Cle) is bothered by a sore knee.  Fantasy players are
bothered that he is still mentioned as a player in the NFL.

TE Aaron Shea (Cle) is listed as questionable with sore quadriceps.
He was limited in practice, but expects to play in the game.

TE Jackie Harris (Dal) was quoted as saying he will play this
weekend.  He is expected to practice on Thursday and is listed as
questionable on the injury report with a sore knee.

TE Tony Gonzalez (KC) is perfectly fine and just did not catch a pass
last week from 6 attempts from Warren Moon.  If Grbac plays, expect
him to get the ball to Tony again.

TE Hunter Goodwin (Mia) has a tight hamstring, but is expected to
play.

TE Johnny McWilliams (Min) is now the starter.  John Davis still gets
a lot of looks though.

TE Chad Lewis (Phi) is expected to play with a sore elbow.

///////////////////////////////

Kickers in the News:

PK David Akers (Phi) is expected to play with a pulled quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (Stl) looks like he will kick this week.  But he has
looked like he was ready before and then gave way to Jeff Hall
minutes before game-time.  Now that the Rams are tied for first
though, expect the players to start working through the pain.  I rate
Wilkins chance to start at close to 90% this week.

 ""Conduct of Texas Fans at Friday's Football Game Dismays Former Student""

 November 28, 2000

 Dear Battalion and Daily Texan:

Please help me.  As a product of both Texas A&M and the University of
Texas - Austin, I thought I had learned a lot.  But I experienced some new
things at the football game this past Friday that my education had not 
prepared
me for.  No doubt there are Longhorn scholars who can set me straight.  I
watched many joyful Texas fans along with a few Aggies tailgating and
carousing.  Super.  Fall football rivalry.  Spirits were literally in
abundance.  May the better football team win.

Then I saw things that I cannot really comprehend.  I saw a Longhorn fan
with a t-shirt showing a fallen-over Bonfire.  The caption read, ""What's
wrong, Aggies? Can't keep it up?""  Can someone explain that to me?  I do
not get it.  I assure you, I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understand
evil.

I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&M who were in
Corps of Cadets uniforms.  ""Little Hitlers,"" they were called.  They were 
being
spat at.  Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.  I
thought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.

I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in the
finest possible way?  - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face it
square on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, ""Heil
Hitler"" sign. 

What don't I know here?  What didn't I learn in history class?  All these
things happened before kickoff.

Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as a
thank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.  That support
obviously came from the finer Horns.  I admired the fortitude and
restraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.

Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns have
More than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.  They prefer to use their
middle finger.  Class.  Really intelligent and creative.  That will
quickly teach those ""littlest"" Longhorns how to show spirit.  I just pray they
get an honest chance to choose.

I am learning.  I have attended both schools.  I will choose the higher
ground.

I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&M who were in
Corps of Cadets uniforms.  ""Little Hitlers,"" they were called.  They were 
being
spat at.  Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.  I
thought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.

I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in the
finest possible way?  - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face it
square on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, ""Heil
Hitler"" sign. 

What don't I know here?  What didn't I learn in history class?  All these
things happened before kickoff.

Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as a
thank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.  That support
obviously came from the finer Horns.  I admired the fortitude and
restraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.

Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns have
More than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.  They prefer to use their
middle finger.  Class.  Really intelligent and creative.  That will
quickly teach those ""littlest"" Longhorns how to show spirit.  I just pray they
get an honest chance to choose.

I am learning.  I have attended both schools.  I will choose the higher
ground.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 After missing most of the season because of a broken leg, Bradford is now 
recovering from torn cartilage in his right knee.  He still hopes to return 
for a December 10 game against the Lions.  Right now he is having trouble 
pushing off on his knee.  Stay away from Bradford in your Fantasy league 
until next season.     

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 11/30/00 
 Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England.  Although he is still listed as 
questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is 
optimistic. ""Right now, I'd say he'll play,"" said Cunningham, ""but we'll see 
what (today) brings."" Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it 
would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - 
especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning.    

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 Smith's injured right hamstring has made significant progress since he 
missed last week's game against the Colts, and the Dolphins are cautiously 
optimistic that he  could return for this week's game against Buffalo. 
Despite experiencing a slight ""tweak"" in the hamstring after Wednesday's 
practice, Smith still believes he will be ready to go. ""I feel fine,"" Smith 
said, ""I have no pain in my leg. I'm running and cutting without any pain.""  
Those Fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation, however,  would be 
wise to steer clear of Smith this week. Playing in the cold at Buffalo could 
hinder Smith's performance, which is a chance you won't want to take at this 
point of the season.     

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 11/30/00 
 Contrary to earlier reports, the Dolphins are now ""optimistic"" that Fiedler 
will be their starting quarterback for this week's game against Buffalo. He 
took 75 percent of the snaps with the first team during Wednesday's practice 
and reported that he felt fine. It would be a remarkable recovery for 
Fielder, who couldn't even raise his right arm on Sunday. ""If he's OK 
(today), he's starting,"" said Head Coach Dave Wannstedt. Even if he does 
start, Fielder isn't a very strong option for Fantasy owners who have 
advanced to their league's playoffs.     

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - FIBSABs Updated 11/30/00 
 Enis has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season.  Where have we heard 
this before? During the offseason Enis bulked up to 250 pounds and promised 
to run over the opposition.  He looked slow carrying the ball this season and 
was replaced at HB by James Allen.  With HB Marlon Barnes and Allen in tow, 
Enis may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere.  He is down to 242 
pounds already and would like to reach 235.  Even if he does reach this goal 
don't count on him being too productive.  Wait and see if he re-emerges as a 
star before you gamble and put him on your Fantasy team next year.     

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/30/00 
 McNown is listed as questionable but will be the emergency QB for sunday's 
game against the Bears, behind Shane Matthews and backup Mark Hartsell.  It 
appears that McNown is done for the Fantasy season.  His seperated shoulder 
rendered him helpless for the latter part of 2000,  but even when he was 
healthy he didn't produce too much.    

 Shaun King , QB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/30/00 
 King practiced Wednesday and will start Sunday against Dallas.  He sat out a 
workout Monday because of a lower back strain, but said he felt fine after 
taking most of the snaps as the Bucs began preparations for the Cowboys.   
King hasn't been too productive in recent weeks and don't expect that to 
change against Dallas this week.  The Cowboys have only allowed 185.5  
passing yards per game this season.  But King is still one of the better QBs 
in the league.  He may not have a stellar game this Sunday but will be good 
enough to help your Fantasy team in the playoffs.     

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 McGarity injured his left ankle in practice on Wednesday, leaving him 
questionable for Sunday's game at Tampa Bay.  The Cowboys, who have been 
devastated by injuries all season long, can ill-afford to lose McGarity, who 
has become one of their more consistent receivers in recent weeks. Fantasy 
owners should avoid starting any of Dallas' receivers other than James 
McKnight for the duration of the season.     

 Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 With the shoulder injury to backup Dave Brown, Greisen will likely be 
Arizona's number two quarterback this week against the Bengals. He has only 
thrown nine passes in three career appearances, but could see some playing 
time this week if starter Jake Plummer re-aggravates the rib injury that kept 
him out of last week's game against the Giants. Fantasy owners should avoid 
Arizona quarterbacks this week at all costs, especially with the playoffs 
beginning for most leagues.     

 Ricky Williams , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Williams could be back in time for the final regular season game on December 
24.  ""There's a chance he can come back,"" coach Jim Haslett said. ""We're kind 
of shooting for the last game, but hopefully the playoffs.""  Most Fantasy 
leagues will be over by Week 17.  But if your team is still playing having 
Williams will definitely help.    

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/30/00 
 Owens will play this week against the Chargers but at this point he is not 
healthy enough to take a gamble on.  ""I'll definitely play this week,"" said 
Owens.  ""It's all a matter of how much pain I can tolerate.""   Owens' toe is 
purple and swollen, and he can't run at top speed.  Don't expect him to put 
up good numbers this week.  Use another receiver instead of Owens if 
possible.     

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Jurevicius did a good job replacing Ike Hilliard last week, catching six 
passes for 70 yards in New York's 31-7 win. He will start in place of his 
injured teammate once again, but don't expect the same type of numbers 
against the Redskins. It would be wise to use other receivers on your roster 
this week if possible, especially considering that Jurevicius will probably 
find himself lined up across from Deion Sanders for most of the day.     

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/29/00 
 Toomer accounted for 89 yards of total offense and a touchdown in last 
Sunday night's 31-7 win over Arizona. He will face off against a talented 
Redskins' secondary this week that held him to only three catches and 31 
yards in the team's first meeting. If your other wideouts have more favorable 
matchups this week, it might be wise to bench Toomer.    

 Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/29/00 
 Hilliard will miss his second straight game this week against Washington.  
He is still suffering from a punishing hit from Lions' safety Kurt Shultz two 
weeks ago that resulted in a bruised sternum.  Joe Jurevicius will replace 
Hilliard once again.    

 Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/29/00 
 Barber is having a surprisingly solid Fantasy season.  He accounted for 82 
yards from scrimmage and a touchdown in last week's win over the Cardinals. 
The Giants will no doubt continue to use Barber as one of their main 
offensive threats, so he will always have a chance at being productive.  
Unless you have a stacked backfield, you could do a lot worse than putting 
Barber in your starting lineup.    

 Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/29/00 
 Dayne ran the ball 24 times for 85 yards and a touchdown in last Sunday's 
win over Arizona.  Don't expect those types of numbers this week, however, as 
the G-Men face off against a Washington squad that will be hungry for a win.  
In Week Four, the 'Skins held Dayne to only 23 yards rushing, and this week 
shouldn't be much different. Keep Dayne on your bench if your roster allows 
it.   

 Kerry Collins , QB NYG - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/29/00 
 Collins completed 20-of-30 passes for 232 yards and one touchdown in last 
week's win over Arizona.  He has been playing well in recent weeks, throwing 
eleven touchdown passes in his last five games. He will face off against a 
tougher opponent this week, namely the Washington Redskins and their fifth 
ranked pass defense. Collins was unimpressive in the team's first meeting, so 
you may want to consider benching him this week if your roster allows it.     
 

 Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - Top Dogs Updated 11/29/00 
 Vanderjagt missed his only field goal attempt against the Dolphins, a 
59-yarder at the end of regulation that would have sent the game into 
overtime. The miss was his first since Week Two against Oakland. Vanderjagt 
remains one of Fantasy's best kickers, so continue to start him as you enter 
your league's playoffs.      

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 11/29/00 
 Harrison only caught four passes last week against Miami - lucky for Fantasy 
owners that two of them were for touchdowns.  He will go up against a Jets' 
secondary this week that held him to only four catches and 34 yards in Week 
Ten. It's now time for the playoffs, however, so Harrison should be in your 
lineup every week until your season ends, one way or another.   

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/29/00 
 ""The Edge"" just keeps on producing, rushing for 118 yards and catching five 
passes for 37 yards in last week's loss to Miami. He faces the Jets this 
week, a team he lit up for 131 yards rushing and a touchdown in Week Ten. 
Indianapolis needs this game to stay in the playoff hunt, and James, as 
always, will be the Colts' main man on offense.     

 Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/29/00 
 Manning completed 16-of-34 passes for 209 yards and two touchdowns in last 
Sunday's loss to Miami. He will face the Jets this week in New York, which 
may not be a good sign for Fantasy owners. The Colts haven't faired well in 
the cold this season, losing on the road to both Chicago and Green Bay. Start 
Manning this week as always, and hope that he can break away from his team's 
cold weather misfortunes.     

 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Hunter Shively Updated 11/29/00 
 Chandler will be replaced at QB by rookie Doug Johnson for the final three 
games.  The team stated that this move is aimed at allowing Chris Chandler 
some time to heal his wounds.  It will also give them a chance to evaluate 
Johnson.  Considering Atlanta's passing performances it would be wise to 
avoid picking up Johnson, especially as your team enters the postseason.  
Keep an eye on him though.  If he plays well he may be worth drafting next 
year.     

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Klap Updated 11/29/00 
 Pickens tested his hamstring before Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but 
the team decided not to let him play just before gametime. He is close to 
being ready for a return, but likely needs to get more involved in practice 
first. ""Carl practiced last week, but we felt and he felt if he had gone out 
and pushed it a little bit he had that risk factor of reinjuring it,"" said 
Coach Jeff Fisher. ""I would assume he'd be close to play [Sunday against 
Philadelphia]."" Don't expect solid Fantasy numbers out of him, however, as he 
hasn't had a reception since October 1.  

 Troy Edwards , WR PIT - FIBSABs Updated 11/29/00 
 Edwards impressed Coach Bill Cowher with a 27-yard reception against 
Cincinnati last Sunday, but he hasn't yet put himself back in the Steelers' 
receiving picture. As long as Hines Ward continues to play well at flanker, 
don't expect anything from Edwards over the season's final weeks. Check back 
with him next season.  

 Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Johnson will start the team's final three games of the season in place of 
the battered Chris Chandler.  Don't expect Johnson to do too much better.  He 
should have a good game against the Seahawks this week, but overall the 
Falcons receivers don't get open enough.     

 Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Fear Updated 11/29/00 
 The Steelers have listed Bettis as questionable with a calf injury on their 
injury report for Sunday's game against Oakland. He has routinely been listed 
as probable for games this season, yet has played every game. More surprising 
is that Bettis has performed well in recent weeks despite the absence of 
center Dermontti Dawson. Dawson has missed three games with a hamstring 
injury, and is listed as questionable this week, but don't allow his absence 
to affect your decision on whether to start Bettis.  

 Courtney Hawkins , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Hawkins will be listed as questionable on the Steelers' injury report for 
Sunday's game against Oakland. He is expected to play, though, as he was also 
listed as questionable last Sunday but made the start anyway. If he can't go, 
then Plaxico Burress, the man Hawkins replaced in the lineup, would probably 
get the call.  

 Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Fuamatu-Ma'afala will miss his sixth straight game on Sunday against Oakland 
with a broken foot. He is expected to run this week for the first time since 
he suffered the injury, so he should be able to return by the following week. 
Don't expect anything out of Fuamatu-Ma'afala over the final weeks, though, 
as Jerome Bettis has a firm grip on the starting job.  

 Aaron Stecker , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Stecker is still recovering from a bruised knee and is not expected to play 
against the Cowboys Sunday.  He rarely fields kicks anymore and is used 
primarily as a blocker on the return team.    

 Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs Updated 11/29/00 
 Hakim injured his wrist in last Sunday's game against the Saints and is 
questionable for this week's matchup against the Panthers.  If he is unable 
to play, look for Ricky Proehl to receive extended action as the third 
receiver.  Given Proehl's performance last week in which he caught a TD he 
might be worth picking up to replace Hakim if you play in a Fantasy league 
that allows more than two receivers.    

More Updates 

 Player News?Teams? 
 Eric Bass Player News 

 Lions , Active DT Updated 11/29/00 
The Lions' defense will have to pick their poison Thursday when they face the 
Vikings. Will they double-team Randy Moss or Cris Carter? Or both? What will 
they do about QB Daunte Culpepper and RB Robert Smith? It may not matter too 
much if they double-team Moss. He has been known to make catches in double 
coverage but Carter is a different story. They focused their energies on 
stopping Carter in the first game and held him to three catches for 30 yards, 
but Moss had 168 receiving yards and three TDs. Thursday's game could be a 
long one for the Lions' defense. If you have them hope that they can find a 
way to contain Minnesota and score some points for your Fantasy team. 

 Elvis Grbac , Active QB Updated 11/30/00 
Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England. Although he is still listed as questionable 
on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is optimistic. ""Right 
now, I'd say he'll play,"" said Cunningham, ""but we'll see what (today) 
brings."" Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it would be wise to 
use another quarterback if your roster allows it - especially with the 
Fantasy playoffs beginning. 

 Terrell Davis , Reserve RB Updated 11/29/00 
An MRI performed on Davis' leg Tuesday showed a ""stress reaction on the 
mid-lower leg,"" which is a precursor of a stress fracture. He will have his 
leg placed in a boot for about three weeks to prevent a stress fracture, 
meaning he will essentially miss the remainder of the regular season. If you 
have Davis on your Fantasy team and you're not in a keeper league, it's not 
worth holding onto him at this point. 

 Kimble Anders , Reserve RB Updated 11/29/00 
The Kansas City Star says the Chiefs intend to stick with veterans down the 
stretch. That means Anders will continue to start at halfback over Mike 
Cloud. Frank Moreau, however, might see tiem at fullback in place of Donnell 
Bennett and Warren Moon will continue to be the No. 2 QB over Todd Collins. 

 Robert Smith , Active RB Updated 11/27/00 
Smith carried 21 times for 148 yards and a touchdown in Thursday's game 
against the Cowboys. With Marshall Faulk recovering from injury and Edgerrin 
James struggling, Smith is without a doubt the best Fantasy RB right now. 
Look for him to have another solid outing against the shaky Lions' run 
defense this Thursday. 

 Marvin Harrison , Active WR Updated 11/29/00 
Harrison only caught four passes last week against Miami - lucky for Fantasy 
owners that two of them were for touchdowns. He will go up against a Jets' 
secondary this week that held him to only four catches and 34 yards in Week 
Ten. It's now time for the playoffs, however, so Harrison should be in your 
lineup every week until your season ends, one way or another. 

 Donald Hayes , Active WR Updated 11/28/00 
Hayes was deactivated for Monday's game against Green Bay with a groin 
injury. Isaac Byrd, his replacement, had no catches in the game. As long as 
Hayes remains out, Muhsin Muhammad should be expected to be the focus of the 
Panthers' passing game, much like he was Monday night. 

 Donovan McNabb , Reserve QB Updated 11/27/00 
McNabb was McNasty against Washington, accounting for 262 yards of total 
offense and two touchdowns in the Eagles' 23-20 win at FedEx Field. He put 
the offensive unit on his shoulders and single-handedly kept Philadelphia in 
first place in the NFC East. Up next, McNabb will face a tough Tennessee 
squad who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the Jaguars. Don't expect 
huge numbers from McNabb this week, but do expect him to be the focal point 
of Philadelphia's offense once again. 

 Joe Nedney , Active K Updated 11/09/00 
Nedney has made 16-of-17 field goals this season but told the Charlotte 
Observer that he will play elsewhere next season rather than try to compete 
with incumbent kicker John Kasay next year. Nedney will be an unrestricted 
free agent in March and has been filling in for Kasay who tore the ACL in his 
kicking leg during the preseason. ""It's not that I'm not enjoying my time 
here,"" said Nedney. ""It's a great scenario to be doing this well, but I was 
brought in as somebody's replacement - and when that person gets better, 
he'll be the guy."" 

 Joe Horn , Active WR Updated 11/27/00 
Horn was productive once again Sunday catching seven passes for 77 yards. He 
is still the primary receiver but his numbers could suffer in upcoming weeks. 
New starter Aaron Brooks spreads the ball around and scrambles more than Jeff 
Blake. 

 Marcus Robinson , Reserve WR Updated 11/29/00 
Not having QB Cade McNown throw to him has really hurt Robinson's numbers. 
While playing with McNown in his first six games this season, Robinson had 32 
receptions for 506 yards (15.8 average) and four touchdowns. In his last five 
contests, Robinson has just 23 catches for 232 yards (10.1 yards), with one 
touchdown. Except for one quarter against the Eagles, Jim Miller and Shane 
Matthews were the quarterbacks in those ballgames. McNown is still another 
week or so away from playing so look for Robinson to continue to struggle. 

 James Allen , Active RB Updated 11/29/00 
Despite his three fumbles on Sunday, Allen remains in the Bears plans for 
2001, and why wouldn't he. He is the Bears' starting halfback and leading 
rusher, gaining 840 yards this season. Allen will be a restricted free agent 
after this season but Personnel VP Mark Hatley has stated that he would like 
to bring him back next season. If Allen remains confident he will be a good 
Fantasy backup next season. Look for him to have a big game this week against 
a Packers defense that allowed Carolina rookie RB Brad Hoover to run all over 
them Monday. 

 Sylvester Morris , Reserve WR Updated 11/17/00 
Morris is starting to fade after some first-half heroics. He has been very 
inconsistent and don't be hesitant to bench him at this important point of 
the season. 

 Ravens , Reserve DT Updated 11/27/00 
Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming 
the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted 
yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its 
record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just 
seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, 
an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to 
say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore 
has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense 
during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and 
Arizona coming off the bye.

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Skinner was activated from the injured list by the Clippers today. He missed 
five games dating back to November 18 with a sprained right ankle. Skinner 
will need to rebound from a slow start to this season, as he is averaging 5.8 
points and 4.7 rebounds in 10 games thus far.  

 Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Clippers waived Ekezie today, just one day after the team acquired him 
from the Washington Wizards. He likely won't have any Fantasy value anywhere 
he ends up this season, as he's averaging just 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in 
10 games thus far.  

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Barros was activated from the injured list for tonight's game against New 
Jersey. Unfortunately, the 11-year veteran probably won't have much Fantasy 
value this season, as he'll have a harder time getting playing time in 
Detroit than he did in Boston.  

 Don MacLean , F MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The NBA suspended MacLean for five games without pay today for violating the 
steroid policy of the league and the NBA Players' Association. He has been 
limited to just three games this season and was scheduled to miss at least a 
month after undergoing surgery on his right foot November 15. It's unlikely 
MacLean will garner any further Fantasy value this season after this recent 
development, especially considering he is the first player in league history 
to be suspended for steroid use.  

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Dickerson is expected to come off the injured list for Friday's game against 
Indiana or Sunday's matchup with San Antonio.  He has been sidelined for over 
a week with a sprained ankle.  Dickerson will be a little out of synch at 
first but look for him to pick up where he left off after a few games.    

 Samaki Walker , F SA - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Walker is suffering from a sprained left ankle and is not expected to play 
in Wednesday's game against the Kings.  He was on crutches Sunday and Monday, 
but rode a stationary bike during Tuesday's practice.  The ankle could affect 
Walker's numbers for awhile when he finally does return.  Although he has 
been somewhat productive, Walker comes off the bench and is only valuable in 
deeper Fantasy leagues.      

 Tariq Abdul-Wahad , G DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Although Raef LaFrentz will return to the starting lineup, Wahad will 
continue to come off the bench.  Wahad was removed from the starting lineup 
along with LaFrentz two games ago.  As has been the case for most of his 
career Abdul-Wahad has struggled with his shooting this season and hasn't 
been a productive Fantasy player, averaging 5.5 ppg this season.  

 Raef LaFrentz , C DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 LaFrentz will be back in the starting lineup after coming off the bench the 
last two games, his replacement Keon Clark will go back to the bench.  
Although LaFrentz hasn't played too well this season head coach Dan Issel has 
stated he made the original move to prevent singling out one player for the 
team's struggles.  Meaning he benched LaFrentz to appease Tariq Abdul-Wahad 
who was also removed as a starter.  LaFrentz may not play much better now 
that he is back in the starting team but he will still provide as much 
Fantasy production as most other centers.     

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Buckner has missed the team's last five games with a sprained right foot.  
He had an injection in his sprained right foot that will prevent him from 
participating in practices for at least 2-3 days.  This will keep him out of 
action for at least the next two games.  Hubert Davis will continue to start 
at shooting guard and Michael Finley will play small forward in his absence.  
When Buckner finally does return it will take awhile for him to get back into 
game form.     

 Etan Thomas , C DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Thomas has a cast on his right foot for a fractured bone under his right big 
toe.  He is expected to wear the cast for three weeks.  His condition will be 
re-evaluated at that time.  Monitor his situation for now.  He is a good 
rebounder and shot-blocker who may be able to help a Fantasy team in 
January.   

 Mark Bryant , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Bryant signed with the Mavericks Tuesday for the pro-rated veteran minimum.  
He was released by Cleveland on November 15.  Forward Bill Curley was waived 
to make room for Bryant.  Bryant will get some playing time off the bench but 
won't be much help to a Fantasy team.    

 Keith Van Horn , F NJ - The Wave Updated 11/29/00 
 Van Horn has been cleared to do some ""light running"" by team doctors and 
expects to return to the Nets in about two weeks.  He broke his left leg 
during a preseason game against the Orlando Magic.  When Van Horn does 
return, Fantasy owners will certainly be scrambling to pick him up.  

 Jim McIlvaine , C NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 McIlvaine did not play in Tuesday's game against the Jazz due to an 
intestinal infection and won't accompany the team for Wednesday's game in 
Detroit.  His return is yet to be determined.  McIlvaine holds no Fantasy 
value.  

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Atkins is still suffering from a sprained ankle, which kept him out of 
practice on Tuesday.  Although he is listed as probable for Wednesday's game 
against the Nets, rookie Mateen Cleaves may start in Atkins' place.  Even if 
he doesn't play, Atkins isn't expected to miss any significant time due to 
the injury.    

 Wesley Person , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Person was activated from the injured list on Tuesday after missing 
Cleveland's last eight games with an elbow injury. Before the injury, Person 
was averaging 7.4 points and 3.6 rebounds per game. Person will likely split 
time with Trajan Langdon, which diminishes what little Fantasy value he may 
have had.     

 Cherokee Parks , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Parks has been traded once again, this time to the Los Angeles Clippers. He 
was averaging 3.7 points and 3.1 rebounds as Jahidi White's backup in 
Washington.  Parks holds no Fantasy value.  

 Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Clippers waived Ekezie today, just one day after the team acquired him 
from the Washington Wizards. He likely won't have any Fantasy value anywhere 
he ends up this season, as he's averaging just 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in 
10 games thus far.  

 Jermaine O'Neal , F IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/29/00 
 O'Neal was held out of the starting lineup because he was late for a team 
plane Monday.  He had started his team's first 12 games.  He still managed to 
post another double-double, scoring 17 points and grabbing 11 rebounds.  
O'Neal should be back in the starting lineup for Thursday's game at Golden 
State.    

 Jason Collier , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Collier had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Tuesday and will be out 
4-to-6 weeks.  With reserves Collier and Kelvin Cato injured, the Rockets 
will now have to search for a backup for C Hakeem Olajuwon.    

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Sabonis re-injured his left knee when he stepped on teammate Scottie 
Pippen's foot in the first quarter against Seattle on Tuesday night.  The 
extent of his latest injury is not known yet and Sabonis is listed as 
day-to-day.  He missed the first eight games of the season after arthroscopic 
surgery on the knee revealed torn cartilage.   Dale Davis will replace 
Sabonis in the starting lineup if he is unable to play.     

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Washington Wizards acquired Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday 
for forwards Cherokee Parks and Obinna Ekezie, both of whom came to the 
Wizards in an August 22 deal for center Isaac Austin. Nesby, who was third on 
the Clippers in scoring at 7.7 ppg, should immediately assume the small 
forward position for Washington.  

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/28/00 
 Geiger has been diagnosed with developing tendinitis in his right thigh, 
less than one week since he returned to action after undergoing knee surgery 
in the offseason.  The Sixers' center is listed as day to day. For those 
Fantasy owners who grabbed Geiger upon his return, it is time to put him on 
the shelf once again until he is healthy.   

 Erick Dampier , C GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/28/00 
 Dampier didn't practice on Monday because of soreness in his left knee.  He 
has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 10.4 points and 7.2 
rebounds per game for Golden State. Despite his condition, he is expected to 
play against the Clippers on Wednesday night.    

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Barros will likely be activated off the injured list in time for Wednesday's 
game against the Nets.  He will replace Cedric Ceballos, who was traded to 
Miami, on the Pistons' roster.  Barros likely won't see enough playing time 
to be very productive, so his Fantasy value is very slim.     

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 With the addition of Joe Smith, the Pistons are now reportedly shopping 
Williams.  The Detroit Free Press is reporting that Detroit is talking to the 
Los Angeles Clippers about a deal that would involve Williams and both Corey 
Maggette and Tyrone Nesby.  Williams has been a decent Fantasy player thus 
far, averaging 7.8 points and 8.4 rebounds over his first 14 games.  A trade 
to the Clippers would increase Williams' Fantasy value, so you may want to 
consider him for your roster if the deal becomes a reality.    

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/28/00 
 Miami Heat Head Coach Pat Riley plans to give Ceballos a course in 
motivation, adding that he wants the veteran forward to re-capture his 
scoring touch to help Miami get back on the winning track.  ""If he gets his 
mindset back to really being what he was last year and even a couple of years 
ago - that he is a real valued member of a rotation and is needed - that will 
inspire him,"" said Riley. If Riley's tactics work, Ceballos' Fantasy value 
could rise significantly, so keep your eyes on the box scores over the next 
few days.    

 Jonathan Kerner , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Kerner, who had missed all 14 of the Knicks' games this season, was waived 
by the team on Monday.  He has been hampered by patella tendinitis in his 
right knee, and became expendable when the Knicks signed guard Rick Brunson.  
Kerner was of no Fantasy value.    

 Rick Brunson , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Knicks on Monday, replacing the injured Charlie 
Ward on the roster.  Brunson appeared in 54 games for New York from 
1998-2000.  He was signed as a free agent by the Celtics this season but was 
waived on Nov. 21.  He averaged only 3.7 points and 3.4 assists in 20.3 
minutes per game in Boston.  Brunson's numbers likely won't improve with the 
Knicks, so don't waste a roster spot in him.  

 Stromile Swift , G VAN - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Swift is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks after 
suffering an ankle injury.  He hasn't been too productive lately since being 
removed from the regular frontcourt rotation.   

 Kevin Edwards , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Edwards is suffering from a thumb injury and is questionable for Monday's 
road game against the Knicks.  If he is unable to play Doug West will 
probably start at shooting guard.

Terrell Fletcher (SD) vs 49er  Defense?? Fletcher is probable with a rib =

certainly think the best uniforms were in the 1969 season (perhaps influenc=
ed=20
by a national championship?). These were burnt orange jerseys (sans=20
individual name on back and ""TEXAS"" on the front), with the plain white pan=
ts=20
and orange stockings. The white uniform still had the orange stockings but=

the jersey was white. You may remember that Fred Akers brought the=20
""candy-striped"" pants (ala OU) and added the ""TEXAS"" to the jersey.=20

would add something to both uniforms, but particularly the road white. One=
=20
amusing memory when Darrell Royal was questioned about the plainness of the=
=20
uniforms; his response was that these are ""work clothes"" and not intended t=

=09
=09 Ignore all that guff about the Longhorns uniforms. I think they are amo=

=20
when you  take a leap and go with what you see with your own eyes.? This gu=

writing this column late in the season is that you can almost guess which =

players to talk about as most Fantasy Teams still interested in December ar=

A guy brings his girlfriend back to her home after being out on a date.
They reach the
front door, he leans with one hand on the wall, looks into her eyes and
says, ""Sweetie,
why don't you give me a blow job?""
""What? You're crazy!"" she replies.
""Don't worry, it will be quick, no problem!""
""No!! Someone may see; a relative, a neighbor...""
""At this time of the night, no one will show up,"" he adds.
""I've already said NO, so NO!""
""Honey, it's just a small blowie, I know you'll like it too!""
""NO!!! I've said NO!!!""
""My love, don't be like that, come on!""
At this moment the girls sister shows up at the door in her nightgown
with her hair totally
in disorder, rubbing her eyes and says, ""Dad says either You have to
blow him, I have to
blow him, or He will come down and give him a blow job himself, but for
God's sake, tell

Some Road to the Presidency
Al Gore is contesting the Presidential election not from clawing ambition,
his spinners tell us, but because he has divined that he really won. Maybe
so. A mind that can count a dimpled chad as a vote is capable of believing
about anything.

Mr. Gore's professed high-mindedness would be easier to credit, though, if
it were not washed in the casual attitude toward the truth that we have come
to expect from the author of no controlling legal authority, the Buddhist
Temple fund-raiser and the iced tea defense.

The Vice President in his Monday speech to the nation repeated the
professions of supermouthpiece David Boies, for example, that there were
10,000 votes in Miami-Dade uncounted. These are in fact votes that were
machine-counted for other offices but did not register a vote for President.
The common-sense view of such a ballot is that the voter wanted to be heard
on other offices, but did not like either candidate for President. There
were 175,000 such ballots across the state of Florida, and 1.25 million
across the nation.

What Mr. Gore really wants is to pour over the 10,000 Miami-Dade ballots in
search of the mysterious ""dimpled chad"" votes for him. Bear in mind that the
county's board back on Nov. 14 shut down its first recount after a sampling
of three precincts turned up only six more votes for Mr. Gore. That seemed
in retrospect to be the sort of reasonable action so thought to be missing
from this endless exercise. The Democrat sued, forcing Miami-Dade to resume.

The Gore team currently argues that Miami-Dade is an undiscovered motherlode
of Gore votes because in the 135 of 614 precincts counted they produced a
Gore gain of 157 votes. But the recount went through the precincts
numerically, and the first tranche, heavily Democratic, are known to have
voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Gore. While those 135 initially counted
precincts gave Mr. Gore 73% of their vote, the Vice President's share of the
whole county was 53%. Those potent projections of Gore numbers from a full
recount that they're citing are undoubtedly an exaggeration.

The Gore lawsuit against Palm Beach is richer still. Here they are literally
arguing that poor Judge Burton and his colleagues didn't use sufficiently
low dimple standards, what the lawsuit calls ""incorrect legal standards,"" to
accept Gore votes. Here as well we have a Democratic county and board, upon
whom the Gore folks were heaping praise less than two weeks ago, which
they're now suing.

In Seminole County, ""independent"" Democrats have sued to kill absentee
ballots certified for Governor Bush, who carried those votes by almost 2 to
1. Their case: The county's elections supervisor broke the law by letting
GOP office workers enter voter identification numbers left off of request
forms sent in by absentee voters, who had otherwise complied by signing the
form and listing the last four digits of their Social Security number. Want
more detail? Normally the ID numbers are preprinted on the forms before
they're sent out, which is what the Democrats did, but the GOP's software. .
. . Oh well, the Democrats are suing.

So let's review the story so far. We had a Florida count Nov. 7, then a
recount, and then we let Al Gore pick several famously Democratic counties
to hand-count; we've let various amounts of ambiguous chads be counted, let
his party officials eyeball the ballots, often going his way by a 2 to 1
vote, let a GOP counter in Broward resign, extended the pre-established
deadline and, let's see, what else? Oh yes, Mr. Gore still lost.

The Gore/Boies strategy now is essentially to sue everyone in sight, hoping
that some cache of votes reopens (Dade) or closes up (Seminole). His lawyers
argued yesterday that he'd already be ahead if so many military ballots
weren't counted. This is not ""counting every vote""; it's asking lawyers to
overturn an election, not once but several times. And it's becoming
increasingly apparent to the American people; two national polls put support
for a Gore concession at 60%, a strikingly high number given the close
election result.

As to the Democrats, a few have wavered publicly on joining the Gore long
march, but mostly the party is circling the two exhausted candidates, on the
one hand standing behind Mr. Gore's attempt to reverse the election, while
simultaneously demanding to share power with the incoming Bush
Administration.

All this said, we have in fact found one Gore gambit to really admire:
Identifying that five-minute seam of network time for a speech at 8:55 p.m.,
five minutes before the start of Monday night football. Pretty clever. The
dimpled-ballot standard may not stand up, but opening up that 8:55
prime-time window for political speech may last forever.

Hole-punch all of your information for your trip (and make copies  of 
anything you'll need), organize it by what you'll need chronologically,  and 
place it in a slim, bright, lightweight soft-side plastic binder.  It's very 
easy to find in your carry bag, and you can easily flip  through to find your 
itinerary, the address of the hotel you're  going to, the phone number of the 
person you're supposed to hook  up with, etc. - Anita Brienza 

If you have any great travel tips, stories, or photos send them  to me and 
you might just  see your name in the next issue of Here's The Deal!

15892,bass-e/all_documents/280.,<7395119.1075854581820.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Dear Eric,

We scored a major victory for election integrity this past
Sunday when Florida certified the election results in George
W. Bush's favor.  I want to thank you for being one of the
325,000 plus Americans who joined the petition campaign at
ElectionIntegrity2000.com to ""Certify the Bush
Victory.""

Unfortunately, Al Gore has flatly refused to accept the fair
and just election results.  Instead, he is pursuing a
calculated course of action intended to overturn the will of
the voters and the CERTIFIED election results.  Included in
these actions are his attempts to attack and discredit
military absentee votes cast for George W. Bush while
simultaneously using manipulative ""hand-counting"" techniques
to convert so-called ""dimpled chads"" into votes for Gore.

This is not fair, it is not right, and the American people
won't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent by
Al Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf.

What Gore is doing is WRONG.  And every day that he continues
to contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or in
the media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers a
clear majority of American citizens.

That's why Election Integrity 2000 has started up a new
campaign to collect online letters and send them to Al Gore
urging him to concede the election NOW!

Al Gore always claims to be ""listening to the will of the
people.""  The fact is, WE are the people, and he is about to
hear from us in a big way.

But just in case this isn't enough, we'll also be sending daily
press releases to the leaders in the House and Senate as well
as the major news media informing them about the overwhelming
response we are receiving from American people demanding that
Al Gore concede.

Eric, this is a personalized message just for you.
Please go to the link at the bottom of this message to sign your
letter to Al Gore.

Do NOT forward this e-mail.

In the couple of hours, I'll send you another e-mail for you
to forward to every friend who might be interested in sending a
message to Al Gore that America wants him to concede.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

It Costs So Little, And It Means So Much

As you are aware, if the voting results in
Florida stand as they are now, George W.
Bush will be our next President. This will
have catastrophic results in our vital,
indispensable, entertainment industry.

Barbara Streisand, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon,
Whoopie Goldberg, Alec Baldwin, among many
others have sworn to leave the country if George
W. Bush is elected President.

And this is where YOU can help. We need
volunteers to help pack and load moving vans.
We also need volunteers to provide airfare for
these irreplaceable national treasures so they
can relocate before they can change their minds.

For the cost of a small SUV you can sponsor
one of these celebrities and their unfortunate
relocation. You will know that your efforts are
helping when you receive postcards, letters and
pictures from your chosen ""refugee"" as they
learn to become a useful citizen in the
third world country of their choosing.

You will help, won't you? It costs so little,
but it means so much.

Call 1-800-deport-a-lib. Operators are standing by.
Major credit cards are accepted.

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Washington Wizards acquired Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday 
for forwards Cherokee Parks and Obinna Ekezie, both of whom came to the 
Wizards in an August 22 deal for center Isaac Austin. Nesby, who was third on 
the Clippers in scoring at 7.7 ppg, should immediately assume the small 
forward position for Washington.  

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/28/00 
 Geiger has been diagnosed with developing tendinitis in his right thigh, 
less than one week since he returned to action after undergoing knee surgery 
in the offseason.  The Sixers' center is listed as day to day. For those 
Fantasy owners who grabbed Geiger upon his return, it is time to put him on 
the shelf once again until he is healthy.   

 Erick Dampier , C GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/28/00 
 Dampier didn't practice on Monday because of soreness in his left knee.  He 
has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 10.4 points and 7.2 
rebounds per game for Golden State. Despite his condition, he is expected to 
play against the Clippers on Wednesday night.    

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Barros will likely be activated off the injured list in time for Wednesday's 
game against the Nets.  He will replace Cedric Ceballos, who was traded to 
Miami, on the Pistons' roster.  Barros likely won't see enough playing time 
to be very productive, so his Fantasy value is very slim.     

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 With the addition of Joe Smith, the Pistons are now reportedly shopping 
Williams.  The Detroit Free Press is reporting that Detroit is talking to the 
Los Angeles Clippers about a deal that would involve Williams and both Corey 
Maggette and Tyrone Nesby.  Williams has been a decent Fantasy player thus 
far, averaging 7.8 points and 8.4 rebounds over his first 14 games.  A trade 
to the Clippers would increase Williams' Fantasy value, so you may want to 
consider him for your roster if the deal becomes a reality.    

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/28/00 
 Miami Heat Head Coach Pat Riley plans to give Ceballos a course in 
motivation, adding that he wants the veteran forward to re-capture his 
scoring touch to help Miami get back on the winning track.  ""If he gets his 
mindset back to really being what he was last year and even a couple of years 
ago - that he is a real valued member of a rotation and is needed - that will 
inspire him,"" said Riley. If Riley's tactics work, Ceballos' Fantasy value 
could rise significantly, so keep your eyes on the box scores over the next 
few days.    

 Jonathan Kerner , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Kerner, who had missed all 14 of the Knicks' games this season, was waived 
by the team on Monday.  He has been hampered by patella tendinitis in his 
right knee, and became expendable when the Knicks signed guard Rick Brunson.  
Kerner was of no Fantasy value.    

 Rick Brunson , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Knicks on Monday, replacing the injured Charlie 
Ward on the roster.  Brunson appeared in 54 games for New York from 
1998-2000.  He was signed as a free agent by the Celtics this season but was 
waived on Nov. 21.  He averaged only 3.7 points and 3.4 assists in 20.3 
minutes per game in Boston.  Brunson's numbers likely won't improve with the 
Knicks, so don't waste a roster spot in him.  

 Stromile Swift , G VAN - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Swift is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks after 
suffering an ankle injury.  He hasn't been too productive lately since being 
removed from the regular frontcourt rotation.   

 Kevin Edwards , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Edwards is suffering from a thumb injury and is questionable for Monday's 
road game against the Knicks.  If he is unable to play Doug West will 
probably start at shooting guard.    

 Jason Collier , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Collier is expected to be sidelined three to four weeks with torn cartilage 
in his right knee and will undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday morning.  
With reserves Collier and Kelvin Cato injured, the Rockets will now have to 
search for a backup for C Hakeem Olajuwon.    

 Baron Davis , G CHA - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00 
 Davis was named the NBA's Player of the Week by the league on Monday.  He 
averaged 12.5 points, 10.5 assists and 8.8 rebounds per game in leading the 
Hornets to a 4-0 week.  Davis is turning out to be a real Fantasy star early 
in the season, so be sure to pick him up if he is still available in your 
league.    

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/27/00 
 Carter will be sidelined for at least the next two games after suffering an 
injured knee tendon on Sunday against the Bulls.  He won't travel with the 
team this week as they head to the road to face both Dallas and Washington.  
With only three games on the slate for Toronto, make room on your bench for 
Carter until he is healthy.       

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/27/00 
 Sprewell will replace the injured Charlie Ward at the point guard position 
in Monday's game against Vancouver.  In what has been called the ""big 
backcourt,"" Sprewell would play the one while Allan Houston remains the 
shooting guard.  Sprewell's numbers should remain the same at worst, but he 
could see a slight increase in scoring if he can post up smaller point 
guards.     

 Glen Rice , G NY - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Rice will get the start at small forward in Monday night's game against the 
Vancouver Grizzlies. The move was made in an effort to halt the Knicks' 
two-game losing streak while also giving the offense some much needed scoring 
punch. Look for Rice's production to increase as a result of the lineup 
change.      

 Marcus Fizer , F CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Fizer missed Sunday's game against the Raptors with a sprained right ankle.  
He had been receiving treatment for the injury in an effort to play, but felt 
that he would do the team more harm than good by playing.  Despite the 
injury, Fizer expects to return to practice on Monday.  With the success of 
so many forwards in the league this season, Fizer has lost some of his 
Fantasy value.  He isn't a viable Fantasy option as of right now, but owners 
in deeper leagues could do worse than keeping Fizer on their roster.    

 Doug Overton , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Overton sprained his right ankle during Sunday's loss to the Grizzlies.  He 
sustained the injury while chasing down a lose ball in the fourth quarter.  
Overton, who was signed by the Celtics last week, is of little Fantasy value 
in most leagues.  His availability for Tuesday's game against the Cavaliers 
is uncertain.     

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Atkins sprained his left ankle in the first half of Sunday's loss to the 
Jazz, but returned to the game 11 minutes after halftime.  X-rays on Atkins' 
ankle weren't required, but his status for Wednesday's game against New 
Jersey is still unknown.    

 Luc Longley , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Longley was activated on Saturday after missing New York's first 14 games 
with a knee injury.  He hasn't played since suffered the injury back on 
September 29 while playing for Australia in the Olympics.  Unless you are 
desperate for a center, Longley isn't much of an option in the world of 
Fantasy.     

 Felton Spencer , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Spencer was placed on the injured list after suffering a sprained right knee 
against Atlanta on Wednesday night.  He averaged 1.8 points and 2.6 rebounds 
in five games, and wasn't much of a factor in most Fantasy leagues.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00 
 The Miami Heat, looking for help off the bench, acquired Ceballos from the 
Detroit Pistons on Sunday night for a conditional second-round draft choice. 
The Heat have been hit by injuries this season, especially at small forward. 
Ceballos is expected to step into a bench role expected to be filled by 
swingman Dan Majerle, who has missed much of the season with a torn 
hamstring. To make room for Ceballos, the Heat waived forward Jamal Robinson. 
 

 Charlie Ward , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/26/00 
 Ward will have arthroscopic surgery Monday to clear loose cartilage out of 
his right knee. The procedure will be performed by team physician Dr. Norman 
Scott and Ward is expected to miss six to eight weeks. He likely will go on 
the injured list, with rookie forward Pete Mickeal to be activated.   

 Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/26/00 
 McGrady, Orlando's leading scorer with a 22.8-point average, missed Saturday 
night's game against the Atlanta Hawks because of an infected left hand. The 
fourth-year pro was replaced in the starting lineup by rookie Mike Miller.   
McGrady's status is day-to-day.    

 Anfernee Hardaway , G PHO - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/26/00 
 Hardaway underwent arthroscopic surgery on his ailing left knee Saturday to 
repair frayed cartilage.   Team doctors believe the flap of cartilage was the 
source of irritation in the knee. Doctors also said they also treated a cyst 
near the rear of the knee joint.   Hardaway, put on the injured list Oct. 30 
before the season started, is now expected to be sidelined another 3-to-4 
weeks.    

 Jerome Kersey , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00 
 Kersey, a veteran of 16 years in the NBA, signed Friday with the Milwaukee 
Bucks.  He will be a valuable player off the bench for the Bucks but has no 
real Fantasy value.     

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/25/00 
 Jackson, the Atlanta Hawks' leading scorer, was placed on the injured list 
with a sprained ligament in his right knee.   DeMarr Johnson will probably 
start at shooting guard in his place.  Besides for Mutombo, Jackson was the 
only Hawk putting up good Fantasy numbers consistently.     

 Sam Perkins , F IND - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00 
 The Pacers placed starting center Sam Perkins on the injured list Thursday 
before their game against Toronto.  Terry Mills was activated form the list 
to take Perkins' place on the roster.  Jermaine O'Neal will start at center 
in Perkins' absence.     

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/23/00 
 The Spurs placed Jackson on the injured list Wednesday with a sprained left 
ankle. He has played in just one game this season, scoring two points, and is 
probably not worth holding onto for your Fantasy team.  

 Gary Payton , G SEA - Fear Updated 11/23/00 
 Payton had his team-imposed suspension lifted Wednesday, the same day it had 
been dished out. He played last night against San Antonio, so by all means, 
keep him in your active lineup.  

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/23/00 
 Fortson had successful surgery on his broken right foot Wednesday, and will 
be sidelined for at least two months. He had been leading the NBA in 
rebounding when he suffered the injury, and was placed on the injured list 
November 15. His rehabilitation program will consist of an immobilization of 
the foot for about eight weeks, after which point he will enter the final 
phase of recovery. Fortson will likely not return to the Warriors until after 
the All-Star break.

1   Talking Points to Set the Record Straight
2   Statement by Secretary James A. Baker, III
3   What They're Saying...
_________________________________________________________________


1
TALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT

MYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have
never been counted.

BOIES:  ""[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been
counted once for the presidency of the United States.""  [Today
Show, 11/27/00]

FACT:
~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once
  on election night and again during the automatic recount.

~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots
  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in
  every race on the ballot, including races for President.

~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,
  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in
  Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.

~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)
  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute
  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.  These ballots
  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for
  President.

~ This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote
  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be
  undecided about the choice for President.  In particular, a
  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may
  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable
  with his or her party's choice for President and yet
  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  So he or
  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for
  President.


MYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been
counted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead
by 9 votes.

FACT:
~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and
  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach
  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by
  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of
  the certified votes from Nassau County.

~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday
  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory
  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.

~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme
  Court's deadline.

~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not
  proceeding with a manual recount.

~ The 157 ""interim gain"" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a
  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.  Gore won
  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while
  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  It would be
  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican
  precincts, too.  Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those
  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,
  favored Bush.  The Gore approach would treat these minorities
  in a discriminatory fashion.

~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and
  federal law should be counted.  Counties recognized this and
  counted them.  Even Joe Lieberman said that such military
  ballots should not be rejected.


MYTH:  Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not
for the Republican ""mob"" that ""intimidated"" the canvassing board.

   KLAIN:  ""We think already almost 160 votes were counted in
   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...  But I think
   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a
   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a
   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept
   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the
   kind of end that we have to American elections.""
   [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]

FACT:
~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's
  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it
  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit
  the recount to only a select set of the votes.

~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the
  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated
  clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd.

~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,
  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  The crowd was
  quieted promptly.


MYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by
adding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by
the board as illegal.

FACT:
~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the
  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from
  the rest, and not counted.  As a result, Bush received 124
  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election
  night.

~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor
  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.  Because the
  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final
  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of
  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the
  count to make it accurate.

~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to
  certify the original election night count - which included the
  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which
  mistakenly omitted those ballots).

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Regrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit
contesting the certified election results in Florida.  Their
aim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of
counts and recounts.

As I said last night, America has never had a presidential
election decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.
This is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,
uncertain, and controversial territory.

Therefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of
the litigation team who will be defending the vote of
Floridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.

I have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,
Florida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.  Mr.
Richard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of
Florida, has 33 years of trial experience.

Other members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of
the law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.  Together they
bring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.

The other two members of our senior litigation team are law
partners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.  Together,
Daryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience
practicing in court.

These five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the
overall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on
four issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize.

WHAT THEY'RE SAYING...

Quotes from Democrats:

""It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last
legal limit to get the election...I don't think he should.""
  - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin;
    Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00


U.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, will vote for
Texas Gov. George W. Bush if the presidential race is ultimately
decided by the U.S. House of Representatives.

""I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth
Congressional District voted.  And in this case, Governor Bush
carried [my district].""
  - The (Mississippi) Sun Herald, 11/28/00


Monday, Indiana House Speaker John Gregg, D-Sandborn, called on
Gore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election
in doubt for 20 days.

""He needs to pick up the phone, call Austin and say, 'Mr.
President, congratulations. I support you as president 100
percent.""
  - Indianapolis Star, 11/26/00


Self-described liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBC's ""Hardball
with Chris Matthews,"" 11/27/00:
""They're talking about 26,000 people that they said their votes
didn't count.  There are 35,000 other people in Florida who's
votes were not counted that lie in George Bush country...Many,
many more are Bush votes and they don't say a word about that.""


Quotes from Media:

Peggy Noonan on Fox News Channel's ""Hannity and Colmes,"" 11/27/00:
""...a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without
having that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of
thought and logic and argument...

""You cannot say of the ballot, just because nobody voted for Bush
or Gore, that it's really a secret Gore vote that didn't get
counted...""


Salon.com's Joan Walsh, 11/28/00:
""His condescending, singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday
night was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was
almost insulting.""


Don Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBC's ""Imus in the Morning,""
11/28/00:
Imus:  ""What if Gore had won, and Bush...I mean, what if the
roles were reversed, how would, I wouldn't want to include you in
this, but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be
treating all this if the roles were reversed.""

Fineman: ""Oh my God, ...you kidding?!  That George Bush
was a cry baby, that he was the spoiled son of a failed
President.  You know, you can just here it.  The personal attacks
on Bush would be just absolutely vicious.""


Ceci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC, 11/27/00:
Connolly:  ""But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore, that
you sometimes get, that has turned off many Americans over time.
And you also got a little bit of whining, frankly, when he
started talking about voter intimidation.""

Reid:  ""Some thought it very odd, why they had all the
photographers in there flashing.  It was a bit distracting.  And
the flags, some people think maybe it's an overdose on the flags.
And another question:  a very formal setting for a very personal
conversation with the American people.""


Howard Fineman on MSNBC, 11/27/00:
Fineman: ""He (Gore) had to make clear to people that there was
something about him, some essential goodness in him, that made
it worth fighting this fight.  And when he said, 'If I lose, so
be it,' he had to be convincing on that point.  And I must say,
after all the arguing in this very divided election, it's going
to be hard for most Americans to agree with that...

""...most Americans think that this election was fair.  He's got
to make the case that it isn't, and it's hard for him to do it.

""...political terms, I'm not sure how much time he really has...""

Print up a sheet of address labels with the name/address/phone  of your 
destination hotel, and your own name and email address.  Using the airline 
counter luggage tags, affix a label on each suitcase,  including carry-on. 
When traveling around your vacation spot, the  extra labels are very handy in 
a variety of ways and your luggage  is less likely to be lost. -Robert P.

AL GORE WENT DOWN TO FLORIDA

Al Gore went down to Florida He was lookin' for an election to steal.
He was in a bind Cause he was way behind, And he was willin' to cut a
deal. When he came across a Gov'ner Knawin' on a victory and chewin' hard,
Veep Gore jumped up on a hickory stump and said, ""Gov, let me tell you what""

""I bet you didn't know it but I'm a contender in Florida too, and if you
care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.
Now you ran a good campaign down here, but give Al Gore his due.
I'll bet a nation of gold and the white house it holds, that I got more
votes than you!""

The gov'ner said, ""My names Dubya and it might be a sin....  But I'll
take that bet, you're gonna regret, cause this Texan always wins""

(Chorus)

Dubya rally up your troops and fight for that vote hard.  Cause Al
Gore's loose in Florida and Bill Daley holds the cards.  If you win you get
that shiny nation, made of gold, but if you lose, then Al Gore gets con-trol.

Al Gore opened up his mouth and said ""I'll start this show""
And fire burned in the eyes of lawyers, who knew they'd make some dough.
And he pulled his hand across his lips, and he made an evil grin.
Then in walked all the Palm Beach voters, Dubya's chances were lookin'
thin.

(Guitar/bass solo)

When Al Gore finished, Dubya said...  ""Well, your pretty good ol' son.
Now plant your butt in that chair right there and let me show you how it's
done!""

(Chorus II)

Dems in the orange groves, Run George, Run.  You can't lose now in the 
land of the sun.  Your dads on your side and your brothers' in tow, Gore in 
the White
House, God, Please NO!

(Fast Fiddle/Guitar solo)

AL Gore bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.
He conceded that golden nation on the Ground at Dubya's feet.
Dubya said, ""Gore, just come on back if ya ever wanna try again, cause I
told you once you tree huggin' dunce, this Texan always wins!""

Subject: WINNING TICKET


Dear  State 
Lottery Commission,

??? I know I chose the  
winning numbers for Wednesday's Lotto drawing.? But
upon further  review, 
it appears the incorrect numbers appeared on my
ticket.
How  could this 
happen?? The root cause of this dilemma is the form I  filled
out to get 
my ticket.? The form is very confusing.? I  thought I 
was
choosing
one set of numbers, (the winning numbers), when  in reality I 
chose a
completely different set of numbers.? The  numbers and boxes on 
the form are
so close together, it's impossible to  determine which box to 
fill in for
which number.
??? I  checked with at least 3,000 
other people, and they all had the exact
same  problem.? I'm sure if you 
review the form I filled out, it will  become
very clear that I'm entitled to 
the money from Wednesday's  drawing.? Please
reply with the date, time, 
and location, for me to  collect the winnings due
to me.

Thank you for your assistance in this  
matter.

Al  
Gore

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 11/28/00 
 Connell's status for Sunday's game against the Giants is seriously in 
doubt.  He sprained his knee in last week's game against the Eagles, and Head 
Coach Norv Turner has already stated that Connell will not start.  This 
should serve notice to Fantasy owners who have Connell on their roster not to 
put him in their lineup this week.      

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Head Coach Norv Turner has stated that Fryar will get the start this week 
against the Giants.  He had four catches for 50 yards in last week's loss to 
the Eagles, and could see extended playing time if Albert Connell is unable 
to play for the 'Skins.  Fryar isn't the type of receiver you want to depend 
on for production, especially with the Fantasy league playoffs looming.  
Consider another option if your roster allows it.      

 James Thrash , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 The Washington wideout caught five passes for 121 yards and a touchdown in 
last Sunday's loss to the Eagles.  He seemed to thrive with Jeff George under 
center, but now that Brad Johnson is back from injury, it may be a return to 
mediocrity.  Thrash could, however, see some looks this week if Albert 
Connell's knee injury keeps him from playing extended minutes.       

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Harris sprained his left knee in last week's loss to the Vikings.  However, 
the injury shouldn't keep Harris from playing this week as Dallas travels to 
Tampa Bay to face the Buccaneers.  After a fast start, Harris has really been 
quieted by opposing defenses in recent weeks.  He is a good backup tight end 
in most Fantasy leagues, but his inconsistent numbers keep him from being an 
every week starter.      

 Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 The Doomsday Defense has now become The M.A.S.H. unit.  The Cowboys lost yet 
another player on Monday when defensive end Peppi Zellner tore his ACL in 
practice, effectively ending his season. Zellner now joins Leon Lett (knee), 
George Teague (foot), Chad Hennings (neck) and Darren Woodson (arm) on the 
long list of defensive players who have been injured this season.  Only 
Woodson is still available to the team, but his status for this week's game 
at Tampa Bay is still uncertain. With all of the injuries on defense coupled 
with a brutal final four weeks of the season, it would be a good idea to drop 
Dallas' unit before the playoffs.    

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/28/00 
 Smith, who suffered a concussion on Thanksgiving Day against the Vikings, is 
expected to start this Sunday at Tampa Bay.  He was held out of practice on 
Monday for precautionary reasons but will return to the field for Dallas' 
first full practice of the week on Wednesday. Dallas is likely to give Smith 
the ball quite a bit on Sunday, as they attempt to establish the run against 
a tough Bucs' defense.     

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/28/00 
 Head Coach Norv Turner has indicated that Davis should be ready to play in 
this week's pivotal NFC East matchup against the Giants.  Davis missed last 
week's game against the Eagles with a hairline fracture of his right forearm. 
The return of Davis is great news for Fantasy players who own his rights, 
especially with the playoffs just around the corner.      

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 11/28/00 
 It's official - Rams Coach Mike Martz has announced that Warner will be his 
starting quarterback against Carolina on Sunday. This is good news for 
Fantasy owners of Rams players, as the team is a lot stronger offensively 
when Warner is taking the snaps.  

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 
 Price caught six passes for 44 yards in Sunday's loss to the Buccaneers.  He 
has been a major disappointment this season to Fantasy owners who took a 
chance on him.  In fact, Price hasn't caught a touchdown pass since Week One 
against the Titans. Unless you are involved in a deep league, look elsewhere 
for a reserve wideout.     

 Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Riemersma caught five passes for 82 yards in Sunday's 31-17 loss to the 
Buccaneers. Although he may not post solid numbers every week, his production 
is consistent enough to warrant a starting spot in many Fantasy leagues.  
Keep Riemersma on you roster as the playoffs approach.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 The Bengals have upgraded Mitchell's condition from questionable to probable 
for next Sunday's game against Arizona. Coach Dick LeBeau has not yet named 
his starter for that game, although Mitchell would give the Cincinnati 
offense its best shot at solid Fantasy numbers.  

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Smith completed 10 of 20 passes for 129 yards and a touchdown Sunday against 
Pittsburgh, and the Bengals applauded his efforts in the game. His teammates 
said he was as sharp and confident on the field as he's been all season. 
Coach Dick LeBeau hasn't yet named his starter for next Sunday, although we 
wouldn't recommend either Cincinnati quarterback at this stage of the Fantasy 
season.  

 Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 
 Moulds had a huge day against the Bucs, catching eight passes while 
accounting for 122 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Look for Moulds to 
post good numbers this week against the Dolphins, a team who he has 
absolutely killed in the past.      

 Kevin Johnson , WR CLE - Top Dogs Updated 11/27/00 
 Johnson led the Browns with four catches for 85 yards Sunday against 
Baltimore, although most of that was due to a 67-yard reception that set up a 
Browns touchdown on the game's first drive. He's the closest thing to a 
viable Fantasy starter on the Browns, although the lack of a reliable passing 
game will limit his value over the season's final weeks.  

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Coach Chris Palmer has become increasingly frustrated with Northcutt in 
recent weeks, according to the Akron Beacon Journal . Northcutt has been 
dropping too many passes and committing costly fumbles, including one on a 
punt return Sunday against Baltimore. He had no catches on the day. Palmer is 
likely to start Northcutt the rest of the season, but he's not a recommended 
Fantasy receiver.  

 Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Alexander had a productive day for Washington, catching four passes for 39 
yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to the Eagles.  The 'Skins tight end 
hasn't been consistent at all this season, however, so use another option at 
the position if at all possible.    

 Doug Pederson , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Pederson completed just eight of 16 passes for 108 yards and an interception 
Sunday against Baltimore before being lifted in the second quarter for backup 
Spergon Wynn. We don't recommend Pederson over the season's final weeks, as 
the Browns' offense is showing how much injuries have depleted it this year.  

 Spergon Wynn , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Wynn, who replaced Doug Pederson at the start of the second half of Sunday's 
game against Baltimore, wasn't overly successful in the 18 plays he was a 
part of. He completed five of nine passes, but they went for just 30 yards, 
and he was sacked four times, losing a fumble once. Coach Chris Palmer 
continues to say he wants to bring Wynn along slowly, and the Browns' offense 
is reeling, so don't expect much from him over the season's final weeks.  

 Chris Redman , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Redman was called upon during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against 
Cleveland, although he did not attempt a pass. Unless Baltimore runs away 
with any of its next three games, he will likely not see any more action this 
season.  

 Matt Stover , K BAL - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 
 Stover kicked three field goals Sunday against Cleveland, breaking his 
single-season mark of 29 and passing the 1,000-point mark for his career. He 
added five extra points and now has an NFL-best 116 points on the season. 
Unless you hear otherwise, Stover should be a permanent fixture in your 
starting lineup for the remainder of the season.  

 David Akers , K PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Akers kicked two field goals against the Redskins, including what turned out 
to be the game winner.  He connected on boots of 33 and 30 yards, and has now 
kicked nine field goals in his last three games. Look for Akers' success to 
continue this week against the Titans, in game where the placekickers could 
play a major role in the final score.    

 Jeff Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Talk about a good touchdown percentage - Thomason has caught only nine 
passes all year, but five have been for a touchdown.  Although he does seem 
to get into the end zone quite a bit, don't let the numbers fool you.  Unless 
you are in a deeper Fantasy league, Thomason won't be a reliable option when 
it comes time for your playoffs to begin.  

 Sam Gash , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Gash, making his sixth start in place of injured Obafemi Ayanbadejo, had a 
two-yard touchdown pass in yesterday's game against Cleveland. Don't take 
that to mean he's a sleeper over the remainder of the season; Gash had just 
one other catch (for six yards) in the game and will continue to serve almost 
entirely as a blocker, a role he is perfectly-suited for.  

 Shaun King , QB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/27/00 
 King was rather mediocre against the Bills Sunday.  He completed 10-of-18 
passes for 106 yards.  King has now gone two consecutive games without 
throwing a touchdown pass.  That should change this week when he faces a 
Dallas defense with an almost nonexistent pass rush.  The Cowboys have a 
league worst 17 sacks this season.  King's offensive line will provide him 
with plenty of time to pick the Cowboys' secondary apart.    

 Ravens , DT BAL - Eric Bass Updated 11/27/00 
 Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming 
the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted 
yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its 
record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just 
seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, 
an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to 
say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore 
has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense 
during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and 
Arizona coming off the bye.  

 Charles Johnson , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Johnson has been very unproductive over Philadelphia's last five games, 
compiling only only eleven catches and 94 yards receiving.  None of 
Philadelphia's receivers, including Johnson, is worth wasting a roster spot 
on at this point.  Look for better reserve wideouts before your playoffs 
begin.    

 Torrance Small , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Small could only haul in one pass for 18 yards against the Redskins.  He has 
been a real disappointment to Fantasy owners who took a chance on him, 
catching only one pass in four of his last five games.  It's time to look for 
an alternative to Small if he is still on your roster.    

 Tony Banks , QB BAL - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 
 Banks was called on during the third quarter of Sunday's game against 
Cleveland after it was well out of hand. He completed just two of three 
passes for 45 yards, but looked respectable in a reserve role. Although 
that's good news for the Ravens, don't read into this as a sign he'll get 
much, if any, playing time during Baltimore's final three games.  

 Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Top Dogs Updated 11/27/00 
 Johnson is struggling once again.  He had just two catches for 15 yards 
against the Bills Sunday.  After catching four TDs in three games, Johnson 
has just four catches in the last two.    

 Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Lewis was solid in Sunday's win over Washington, catching six passes for 53 
yards in the game.  He has had three consecutive productive games after a bit 
of a mid-season slump, and should get a number of looks this week against 
Tennessee. Keep him in the starting lineup as your Fantasy playoffs 
approach.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 With the injury to Joe Jurevicius, Dixon will take over as the Giants' third 
down receiver. He has no Fantasy value.  

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Fear Updated 12/12/00 
 An MRI performed on Monday revealed a sprained medial collateral ligament in 
Jurevicius' left knee. Head Coach Jim Fassel says that Jurevicus is expected 
to be sidelined for at least three to four weeks.  Ron Dixon will take over 
as the Giants' third down receiver. At this point, neither player has any 
real Fantasy value.     

 Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Cowboys' defensive line played its best games of the season, sacking 
Redskins' quarterback Jeff George five times while limiting Stephen Davis to 
only 57 yards rushing. Dallas' unit, which has been ravaged by injuries, held 
the 'Skins to only 13 points on the afternoon and looked much more like a 
cohesive unit than in recent weeks. Expect the Cowboys to follow up this 
effort with another solid performance against the Giants, but look long and 
hard before giving Dallas' D the start this week.   

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 With the announcement that Jeff George will remain Washington's starter for 
the last two games, Johnson's season and Fantasy value is all but gone. Don't 
be surprised to see Johnson in a new uniform come training camp.    

 Brian Griese , QB DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00 
 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale.  Coach 
Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning 
to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23.  Fantasy owners should look 
elsehwere for a Fantasy QB.  Griese hasn't played in almost a month.  A 
player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team.      

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that 
have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to 
be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible.  

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar 
has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards 
and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four 
games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to 
Fantasy owners in deeper leagues.   

 Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them 
going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also 
dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up 
against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much 
as a result.  

 James Thrash , WR WAS - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00 
 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the 
Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, 
so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league 
uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three 
man.   

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more 
than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games 
prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by 
being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take 
this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over 
the final two games.  

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win 
over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.   

 Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run 
a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy 
value at this point in the season.   

 Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He 
missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year 
career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't 
start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 12/11/00 
 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the 
Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being 
bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in 
your Fantasy season.   

 Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He 
rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was 
walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to 
play next Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00 
 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in 
two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback 
situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea.   

 R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several 
team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made 
several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a 
October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder 
of the season.  

 Larry Centers , RB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/11/00 
 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' 
Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk.   

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, 
allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the 
Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by 
this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of 
injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati 
next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs.  

 Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 
carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks 
to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point.   

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 12/11/00 
 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing 
for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a 
touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm 
is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to 
try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as 
Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.   

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Risk Managers Updated 12/11/00 
 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 
346 yards.  Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from 
the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week.  If you are one 
of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to 
Fantasy glory.   

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this 
week's game against Dallas.  The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 
passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the 
starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday 
against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins 
this week.    

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 12/11/00 
 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns.  He 
gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards.  With his 
performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back.   
 

 Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Murder Inc. Updated 12/11/00 
 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also 
bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers 
are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team 
when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday.  

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams.  He 
will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter 
will be up for the task.  He struggled in their first meeting but still 
managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown.    

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game 
against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went 
down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving 
Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in 
the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' 
quarterbacks all together.   

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game 
against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven 
carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the 
game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of 
the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy 
value to help you at this important stage of the season.   

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/11/00 
 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday.  Look for 
Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week.  He had six catches 
for 130 yards in their first meeting this season.    

 Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three 
opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, 
could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham 
(groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. 
Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should 
hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a 
better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' 
D this week.

**************************** November 28, 2000  ************************

If you were one of the millions who dealt with the crowds during
Thanksgiving travel, you may be ready for another vacation. If that's the
case, you don't want to miss out on our $158 roundtrip coast-to-coast
super sale (travel through March 1) or our 50 percent off Caribbean sale
(travel through June 15, including the peak winter season). With cold
weather settling in across many parts of the country, 85-degree beaches
and a tall tropical drink sipped under a warming sun sounds pretty good.
If sunshine and beaches are not your cup of Long Island Tea, pick the spot
that hits your fancy and fly between over 58 U.S. cities coast-to-coast
for only $158-198 through March 28 (Florida travel is valid through March
14). As an added plus, check an offer that can make you an elite-level
frequent flyer with just one trip. Most frequent flyers have to rack up a
minimum of 25,000 airmiles to hit the first level of elite status, but we
can tell you how to do it quick and easy. We're posting many other goodies
on our News Desk by the hour. Add it to your bookmarks and visit regularly
to be among the first to know what's up in low fares.

COAST-TO-COAST FROM $158 THROUGH MARCH 1, 2001
Just in time for the holidays, we have coast-to-coast airfares as low as
$158 roundtrip. Chances are, we have the route you need. Please be aware
that travel to Florida will be almost impossible December 18-29 for those
who have not already purchased. Even First Class is almost completely sold
out. That leaves the rest of the country at your disposal on Bestfares.com
bargain fares, or you can book Florida for a welcome post-holiday stay.
We'll even waive that ferocious $40 fuel surcharge to add to your savings.
For example, travel to and from the West Coast--Los Angeles, San
Francisco, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle or Portland--to Baltimore,
Hartford, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, New Orleans, Houston and many more
cities for just $158 roundtrip. From the West Coast to Dallas, Minneapolis
or Milwaukee is just $190. From the West Coast to Boston, New York City,
Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or Miami is only $238. Don't miss out on
these holiday and winter fares. Go home for the holidays (or relax
afterward) on these tempting fares. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898.

LAST 4 DAYS: $198 RT BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES THROUGH MARCH 31
If we don't have the coast-to-coast sale fare you need in one category,
we'll try another. This one requires fast action, with just four days left
to book, but it gives you an extra month of travel (March 1-31) plus
another bucket of fares to draw from. Business travelers face walk-up fare
increases of as much as $370, added since the first of the year. Leisure
travelers can use this sale to fly for slightly more than half of what
business travelers are paying in fare hikes alone. If you live in Seattle,
Portland (OR), Reno, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix or Los
Angeles, head east to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach (the home
of the challenging chad), Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Houston or
Chicago. There are many additional choices. Availability for December
travel is as tight as the smile on a Supreme Court Justice's face, but we
should be able to get you what you need for the remaining months. Don't
miss out on a sale that can save you hundreds of dollars. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898 and scroll to the applicabl=
e
headlines.

RT TO 15 CARIBBEAN CITIES FROM $328 THROUGH JUNE 15, 2001
They said it couldn't be done, but that's the kind of challenge we rise to
meet. The result--$328 roundtrip airfares from 40 U.S. cities to your
choice of 15 cities in the Caribbean for the 2001 peak winter travel
season. These fares can be 50 percent (or more) off standard published
fares. Think warm fun and island breezes in Cancun, St. Maarten, Aruba,
San Juan, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Montego Bay, Grand Cayman, Nassau and
four other Bahamas Islands. Golfers, how about Bermuda's extraordinary
courses? These fares are valid from over 40 U.S. cities starting at $328
roundtrip. Departure cities include New York City, Atlanta, Boston,
Buffalo, Philadelphia and Washington (DC). Our most expensive ticket
(still cheap) is from the West Coast, and it's only $458 roundtrip,
including Denver, Phoenix, San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San
Francisco and Seattle. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10088489.

RT BETWEEN 50 CENTRAL AND EAST COAST CITIES $198-218 THROUGH AUGUST 31
If you live in an expanded Central U.S. area that stretches from Texas to
Minnesota, in Atlanta, or in almost any major city to the east, fly to
dozens of destinations for $198-218 roundtrip. This deal includes New York
City, Boston, Myrtle Beach, many more southeast, southern and Texas cities
and over 50 cities in the Midwest. You can save up to 65 percent and lock
in sale fare travel through August 15, 2001. If you know where you'll be
heading for summer vacation, book now and cross one big planning problem
off your list. These fares also cover New Year's, Spring Break, Easter,
Memorial Day weekend and the Fourth of July. If you've checked out the
fares offered to the general public during these travel periods, you'll
realize what bargains we've negotiated. For details, visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10089324.

ELITE STATUS ON TWA AFTER ONLY ONE TRIP
If you've been considering discretionary leisure travel in December, this
deal could give you the inspiration to confirm. If you have to travel in
December, this deal gives you a bonus that lasts long after you land. Fly
just one roundtrip by December 31, 2000 and we will jump your TWA Aviators
frequent flyer status to elite level--a level that usually requires 25,000
airmiles in one year. If you like free, space-available upgrades to First
Class and bonus miles on all your future trips, you're going to like this
benefit. we'll even show you how to do it on reduced fares. For full
details, visit http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10108936.

Hi  Folks,

I gotta say  before I get started that Monday Night Football=01,s =01&Pack""=

""Cats=018 in the  scoring box was one of the more annoying moves they=01,ve=
 made=20
this season.? =01&Cats=018?? That=01,s so  lame.

Enough of that,  let's jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded  Players=
.?=20
As we head down the home stretch, identifying those  players moving up or=
=20
down can be the difference between making the playoffs or  watching from th=
e=20
sidelines.? As we  head into our 14th week of listing these players, it=01,=
s=20
inevitable  that some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade=

list.? Make sure you understand, what we=01,re  talking about is players th=
at=20
are moving.?  In other words, a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on t=
he=20

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving  Up?

QB Kordell  Stewart (Pit)? Time to give props where props are  due.? Kordel=
l=20
looks like a new  man.? Actually, he looks like the  old Kordell.? The GOOD=
=20
old Kordell.  Over the last three weeks, he ranks as the # 5 QB in my=20
Performance / TD system  based on FF points per game.? Gotta  hand it to Bi=
ll=20
Cowher as it took some guts to bench the starting? WRs like that but Hines=
=20
Ward has  delivered.? It=01,s probably not the  best thing for Jerome Betti=
s=20
owners but Stewart=01,s 3 rushing TDs over the last 3  weeks are huge.?

QB Aaron  Brooks (NO)? Brooks made my upgrade list last week  and I put my=

money where my mouth was outbidding the other owners in my league  to pick=
=20
him up? last week as a free  agent.? I said last week that we=01,d  see how=
 he=20
does with the pressure on all week.? Obviously, this is one cool kid.? If y=
ou=20
saw the footage of him in the  tunnel before the game he looked like he was=

ready to go out and play a game of  flag football or something.? He made =
=20
some mistakes and fought back from adversity several times.? The obvious=20
comparison is a young  Randall Cunningham.? He=01,s skinny and  has a littl=
e bit=20
of those Cunningham crazy legs.? Plus he=01,s got a big arm with that whipp=
y =20
motion.? But the biggest thing that  impresses me about Brooks is his poise=
.?=20
 Grab him if he=01,s available in your league.?

I asked my  friend Tony Pauline from the TFY Draft Preview about Brooks.?=

yards, averaging 2.8 yards per carry with five more  scores.? Led the ACC i=
n=20
passing efficiency two seasons ago, throwing for  57% / 2,282 / 20 / 7.? Go=
od=20
athlete who has shown great improvement in his  quarterback skills the last=
=20
season and a half.? Smooth and fluid, sets his  feet in the pocket, shows=
=20
good strength and stands his ground when being  rushed.? Has a live arm; ca=
n=20
thread a needle, throws ropes and his deep  passes have speed.? Effective=
=20
throwing on the run, squares his shoulders  and quickly releases the ball.=
=20
Eludes or side steps oncoming rushers, pulls the  ball down, running betwee=
n=20
the tackles.? While he has improved his accuracy  and places his passes wel=
l,=20
he often overthrows receivers.? The further  down the field or out to the=
=20
flanks he must get the ball, the more his accuracy  struggles.? Must do a=
=20
better job reading and recognizing defenses, stop  staring down his primary=
=20
target and not hold the ball so long while in the  pocket.? A player who=20
turned himself into a good prospect with a solid  senior campaign.? Mid to=
=20
late Sixth Round.?

Thanks  Tony.? Be sure to check out Tony=01,s  great info at=20
www.TFYDraftPreview.com?

QB Kurt  Warner? (StL)?? Warner=01,s chomping at the bit and has been named=
 the =20
starter this week relieving Trent Green.?  Keep an eye out on how he looks =
in=20
practice.? Coach Mike Martz said last week he was  concerned about Warner=
=01,s=20
grip strength and ability to put rotation on the  ball.? I=01,m thinking he=
=01,ll=20
be good to  go.?

QB? Donovan McNabb (Phi)? What  else can you say about this guy??  Take awa=
y=20
his running game??  No problem.? Give him WRs  that would? struggle to make=
=20
a  division I team? ?No problem.? He finds a way to get it done.? He looks =

at=20
LaVarr Arrington  was injured early and he was the designated =01&spy=018 b=
ut=20
still, it was an  impressive performance against a very good Washington=20
defense.? I see little reason why he won=01,t  continue although he really =
needs=20
help at WR.?

QB Trent  Dilfer (Bal)? I said a couple of weeks ago that Dilfer  might pla=
y=20
the late season 1999 Tony Banks role as coach Brian Billick revives  anothe=
r=20
struggling? QB=01,s  career.? Dilfer seems very  comfortable with what Bill=
ick=20
is asking him to do and brings a little fire and  attitude to the offense=
=20
that had been missing.? I like what they=01,re doing and don=01,t see  why =
it won=01,t=20
continue.? Although  don=01,t forget they=01,re off this week.



QB Brad  Johnson (Was)? Jeff George yields to the young man from  Florida=
=20
State.? His knee is  reportedly good to go and he=01,s been cleared by the=
=20
trainers as fit to  start.? Considering the troubles the  team endured with=
=20
George at the helm, Johnson has already been named the  starter.? He=01,ll =
be=20
working with a  nicked WR corps so we=01,ll see how he fares.?

QB Ryan Leaf  (SD)? Kordell Stewart, Trent Dilfer and Ryan  Leaf?? You gott=
a=20
be kidding me.? But after another solid outing, you  can=01,t deny Leaf is=
=20
making plays.?  Granted, he still throws the ugly interception(s) and he ge=
ts=20
hurt almost  as much as Rob Johnson but the kid could make a difference for=
=20
you if you need a  spot QB.? He=01,s got one of the top 3  TEs in the game =
with=20
Freddie Jones and Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham are  veterans who can make =
a=20
difference.?  This win will have to buoy the spirits and  enthusiasm.

??

RBs Moving Up?

RB Mike  Anderson (Den)? Once is a coincidence.? Twice is a trend. You=01,v=
e got=20
to start  handing credit to Mike Shanahan, Offensive Coordinator Gary Kubia=
k,=20
and that  offensive line. Like everyone else, I marveled at the way Olandis=
=20
Gary was able  to run last year when Terrell Davis went down.? What a great=
=20
job of scouting we all  thought.? But hey, Gary was a pretty  highly touted=
=20
back.? But Mike  Anderson???? Anderson=01,s a  fine back but I=01,ve got to=
 believe=20
it=01,s a team deal here.? The good news is that Anderson=01,s team  isn=01=
,t going=20
anywhere without him and he looks to remain a factor while Terrell  Davis=
=20
recovers from the mystery lower leg ailment.? Watch this during the week, b=
ut=20
it  wouldn=01,t surprise me a bit to see Davis miss another game. ?And as l=
ong=20
as Anderson rolls up 195  rushing yards a game like he did Sunday, you won=
=01,t=20
see Shanahan crying over TD  being out.? Granted 80 of those  yards came on=
=20
one big run but he had a great game any way you slice  it.?

RB Jamal  Lewis (Bal)? I=01,ve been eating crow (Raven?) for a  while now a=
s I=20
was one of those guys not convinced Jamal Lewis would excel at  this level=
=20
after a very disappointing 1999 season at Tennessee.? Lewis is running like=
=20
he did as a  Freshman and Sophomore before the knee injury and he may have=
=20
the best blend of  speed and power in the league this side of Eddie George.=
?=20
Coach Brian Billick has the Raven  offense firing on all cylinders and Lewi=
s=20
remains a huge part of it.? His only down side is that he=01,s off this  we=
ek=20
with a bye.? But that week 16  matchup against Arizona is looking very=20
tasty=01(?

RB Corey  Dillon (Cin)? Considering what he does with that  surrounding cas=
t,=20
I could make a strong case that Corey Dillon is the best back  in the NFL.?=
=20
There have been few  passing attacks in recent memory as impotent as the=20
Bengals, yet Dillon  continues to pound out the yards when defenses know=20
exactly what=01,s coming at  them.? It=01,s amazing to watch.? I don=01,t k=
now how=20
long he can keep it up  but he=01,s got the woeful Cardinals this week and =
you=20
have to like  that.?

RB Warrick  Dunn (TB)? Dunn made the upgrade list last week in  the wake of=
=20
Mike Alstott=01,s knee injury and he delivered in a big way for his  owners=
=20
Sunday with 129 total yards including 2 TDs.? There was some talk about him=
=20
sharing  carries but he was the only guy besides QB Shaun King to run the=
=20
ball for Tampa  Bay.? Look for more of the same from  the Bucs and new=20
offensive coordinator Warren Sapp=01(? Seriously, Dunn showed he could hand=
le =20
20 rushing attempts and I think you=01,ll continue to see them go with what=
=01,s =20
working.? =20



RB Michael  Pittman (Ari)? Pittman may be the lone bright spot on  the=20
Arizona team.? I told you last  week that coach McGinnis loves the guy and=
=20
you saw the results last night as  Pittman rambled for 77 yards on only 13=
=20
carries (5.7 ypc)? Like Corey Dillon, the surrounding team  kills his value=
=20
but if he ran for a team that held a lead, he=01,d be awesome.? Unfortunate=
ly, I=20
don=01,t see Arizona  turning into such a team anytime soon so don=01,t get=
 too=20
excited.? But overall, I like the guy a  lot.?

RB Richie  Anderson (NYJ)? Each year, there are always unheralded  guys who=
=20
post nice numbers but remain well below the radar of many owners.? Many tim=
es=20
they are RBs who quietly post  yardage (and FF points) receiving the ball.?=
=20
Anderson is a prime example of one such  player this year (as?are Tony=20
Richardson and Stanley Pritchett)? He=01,s caught 15 passes over the last 3=
 =20
games and with Curtis Martin nursing a sore gluteus maximus, that trend wil=
l =20
likely continue.???

RB Robert  Holcombe (StL)? It doesn=01,t take a rocket scientist to  see th=
at=20
Marshall Faulk isn=01,t 100%.?  Red flags went up across the country when M=
ike=20
Martz elected to give  Holcombe that shot at the goalline Sunday.?  6 weeks=
=20
ago, that would have been Faulk=01,s carry all day long.? Holcombe looks to=
=20
benefit if Faulk=01,s  workload continues to be decreased.? =20



RB Brad  Hoover (Car)? Aside from having one of those cool  names the fans=
=20
can yell whenever he does something good, Hoover has shown to be  a capable=
=20
replacement for candybone Tshimanga Biakabutuka.? He doesn=01,t have the=20
physical tools of a  Biakabutuka but you can=01,t deny he hasn=01,t been=20
effective.? It wouldn=01,t surprise me a bit to see  Hoover continue to see=
=20
action.

WRs Moving Up

	Reforms in India Are Tantalizing,
But Debates Cool Investor Ardor
	By DANNY PEARL 
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
	NEW DELHI, India -- The tumblers of economic reform have slowly but surely 
been turning in India over the past decade, each click resonating through 
this nation of a billion people. Lately the prospect of unlocking its markets 
has seemed a bit brighter -- but not bright enough to impress foreign 
investors.
	Every day, India's financial pages are filled with news of a new opening: a 
plan to sell the government's stake in a big car company, the lifting of 
controls on the textile industry. But the fine print tells another story: 
stubborn hurdles to foreign investment, insistence on public control and open 
battles among ministers that could force Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 
to protect his diverse coalition government rather than take fresh economic 
gambles.
	""The debate over reforms will be endless unless there is a crisis, and there 
is no crisis around the corner,"" says Mahesh Vyas, executive director of the 
Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, a private organization. India is 
still coasting along with economic growth above 6% a year.
	
	Still, there are some worrisome signs. Last month, Standard & Poor's lowered 
its outlook on the Indian rupee because of the darker prospects for economic 
reform. Foreign investment, already a pittance compared with the rest of 
Asia, has slackened recently, and a few big companies, including excelr Corp. 
of Houston and British Telecommunications PLC, are freezing some India 
investments as their focus shifts to more-developed markets. Just 14% of the 
multinational-company executives recently surveyed by AT Kearney said they 
were more likely to invest in India than in China; 56% said the reverse.
	Even critics think Mr. Vajpayee's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which 
one year ago won a mandate to lead its second coalition government, is 
sincere about pushing for further opening of India's statist economy. But 
what government officials call the second generation of reforms -- India's 
Congress Party launched the first in the early 1990s to allow more private 
enterprise -- is meeting stiff domestic resistance. Workers and traditional 
Indian businesses are as scared of competition as ever, and the Congress 
Party, now in the opposition, is playing on those fears. So the government is 
moving in small, often contradictory steps.
	""Their hearts are in the right place,"" says John Band, executive director of 
ASK Raymond James, an affiliate of the American investment bank.
	Here is how the reforms are shaping up in five critical areas.
	Privatization
	India's program of selling off government companies is still mostly talk, but 
much of it could come to fruition in the next few months. While the 
government probably won't meet its target of raising 100 billion rupees 
($2.14 billion) this fiscal year, it is likely India will shed some perennial 
money losers. The first could be Air India and its domestic counterpart, 
Indian Airlines, both of which have attracted expressions of interest from 
foreign airlines including Air France and Singapore Airlines. Divestment 
Minister Arun Shourie, who isn't revealing the full list, said on the first 
day of the World Economic Forum's ""India Economic Summit"" in New Delhi Sunday 
that before proceeding to formal bids, India will reject suitors who could 
pose national-security concerns. India, he said, wants to avoid buyers who 
might shut down the beleaguered airlines and keep the lucrative landing 
rights.
	Job padding is legendary in India, so fear of job losses is real. Bank 
workers fired a warning shot across privatization's bow this month with a 
one-day, midweek strike against government banks. The next day, the 
government announced it was moving forward anyhow, seeking a law that would 
allow it to reduce its stake in public banks below 50%. The move wasn't as 
bold as it seemed, though: The law wouldn't actually contemplate a sale of 
shares and wouldn't allow any single investor to buy more than 1%. Government 
officials pledged to keep the ""public character"" of the banks.
	Supporters of divestment within Mr. Vajpayee's cabinet are few but 
influential. They are concentrating their efforts on a plan to sell the 
government's 50% stake in car maker Maruti Udyog Ltd., a joint venture of 
Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. and India's government. But the cabinet is divided 
over the sale, and Mr. Vajpayee has to keep all the members of his coalition 
happy, including hardline nationalists. This weekend, Mr. Shourie flew to 
Bombay to placate leaders of the radical Shiv Sena party who were upset about 
the prime minister's recent olive branch to separatists in the embattled 
region of Kashmir. One of their demands, he says, was that ""Foreigners should 
not come to acquire control of the Indian economy.""
	Budget pressure may force India to follow through with privatization. The 
World Bank has cited concern that India's budget deficit is a whopping 9.6% 
of its gross domestic product, though much of the red ink can be traced to 
state budgets. Mr. Vyas of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy 
believes the real benefits of privatization will come only when the states 
start to sell off their bus companies and electric utilities -- but ""that's 
not even being talked about.""
	Media
	India has an unrestrained local press but remains suspicious of foreign 
media, especially when they show naked flesh or give their own spin on the 
Kashmir dispute. Technology has brought paradoxes: Indians now get scores of 
channels by cable TV, but only government-controlled TV over regular antenna. 
Foreign magazines and newspapers enter the country freely by the Internet but 
cannot print in India. (The Wall Street Journal is among the papers that have 
made informal efforts to lift the barrier.)
	
	The newly appointed information minister, Sushma Swaraj, a BJP hard-liner, 
this month seemed to be resolving the issues in favor of openness. At her 
prodding, the government suddenly allowed programmers to serve homes directly 
by satellite -- but with some tight restrictions on foreign ownership. 
Equally worrisome was Ms. Swaraj's explanation for the government's decision 
to move forward. Before, she explained, the government had no satellite 
facility in India; now it did, and could cut off broadcasts that offend 
India's programming code. Ms. Swaraj is looking for ways to regulate Web 
sites, too. ""They are bound by this code,"" she said. ""As yet there is no 
complaint. If there is, we can take care of it.""
	Ms. Swaraj started a ""national debate"" over whether to lift the restrictions 
on foreign media; 10 days later ended it with a firm 'no.' But as one door 
closes in India, another often cracks open. Private FM radio is expected to 
make its debut in the spring. The government has also taken steps to help 
film studios get expansion financing, just as Hollywood starts to prowl the 
Hindi film industry for investments.
	Telecommunications
	The Vajpayee government has earned broad kudos for its liberalization of 
telecommunications, and the results may even help build domestic support for 
other reforms. Sales of new telephones have exploded recently as service 
improves. In Bombay, which once had five-year waiting lists for new telephone 
lines, the government's local-phone company, MTNL, now promises, even if it 
doesn't always deliver, hookups in two days. The reason is new competition 
from a private group that includes a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp.
	Telecom investment is vital for India because so much of the country's 
booming software and call-center business relies on fast communications with 
the U.S. The government only recently loosened its control over international 
data gateways, a move that Indians hope will alleviate heavy daytime data 
traffic jams. Idika Solutions, a software company based in Hyderabad, got in 
the habit of downloading files at 6 a.m. to avoid the rush.
	Further reforms should speed up improvements. Next year, Parliament is 
expected to pass a ""convergence"" law, allowing telephone, wireless and data 
services to come under the same license. And the following year government 
phone company VSNL is scheduled to lose its monopoly on long-distance phone 
service.
	Trade
	In theory, India, a member of the World Trade Organization, has no choice but 
to open its borders to foreign products, and so far it is sticking to 
schedule, passing a new patents law and so forth. But rather than investing 
to get ready for free competition, many business families are simply getting 
out of manufacturing. Their worry isn't so much luxury goods from the West, 
which will still face steep duties even after quotas are lifted in the 
spring, but goods like batteries from China and palm oil from Malaysia. The 
government is starting to heed the call for more protection: Last week, it 
raised duties on cooking oil and listed 131 imported products that would have 
to list prices in rupees and register with the Indian bureaucracy.
	The government is also trying to prepare traditional businesses such as 
textiles for a world without quotas. Still, the industry is so thoroughly 
regulated that it is hard to see India's mild reforms having much effect. For 
example, the government just decided to allow big domestic producers to move 
into certain products that were reserved for small companies, but it still 
requires yarn-spinners to produce 10% of their yarn in a form that can be 
used by obsolete hand looms. With certain fabrics, ""if I produce it on a 
power loom, I'm breaking the law,"" says Ramesh Chander Kesar, president of 
the Textile Association India in New Delhi. ""Why should there should be a 
restriction?""
	The main reason is that textiles employs an estimated one of every six Indian 
workers, and the government is loath to throw them out on the street. 
Actually, even when mills close, as many have in central Bombay, mill owners 
often have to keep paying the workers and are restricted in their reuse of 
the land.
	""If we can fire a worker for not working, that will send a powerful signal. 
But there are no votes in it,"" says Gurchuran Das, former Procter & Gamble 
chief in India and occasional adviser to the Congress Party. ""Nobody has the 
courage to explain to the people the way Clinton had the courage to explain 
NAFTA: that jobs will be lost but, in the end, jobs will be created.""
	Some less courageous moves are possible: one idea under discussion in New 
Delhi is to give labor flexibility to companies that are exporting heavily.
	Finance
	India made some big financial reforms in the early '90s, with liberalization 
of interest rates, loosening of currency restrictions and encouragement of 
private banking. The country just needs some more money to prime the system.
	The government is approving new financial products, such as derivatives. The 
big prize, investment bankers say, would be opening of the 
government-controlled mutual fund and pension plans. Right now, they offer 
fixed returns. Private investment companies want the government to let them 
offer Indians more-aggressive private pensions.
	""They are listening,"" says Raju Panjwani, managing director of Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter India. ""Maybe equities are considered risky, but we can't even 
invest in corporate bonds."" The government has a plan under study, called 
""Project Oasis,"" that would allow private pension fund management, with some 
restrictions.
	Another possible source of long-term capital is insurance, something there 
isn't much of in India. The government took a big step last year in allowing 
private insurance companies back into India after nearly 50 years. But as the 
race to start marketing policies begins, only half a dozen companies have 
jumped in. Foreign companies are limited to 26% of each insurance 
partnership. That is a problem, because launching an insurance company can 
take $75 million, and ""there are not that many Indian companies that can 
support 74% of that kind of a number,"" says Gary Benanav, chief executive of 
New York Life Insurance Co.'s international unit. The company, which is 
launching its India insurance venture in partnership with an Indian 
conglomerate, estimates the Indian market could support 50 insurance 
competitors.
	""They've made a decision which I don't think in the long run is in the best 
interests of India, though I understand it. The colonial era has left a few 
wounds here,"" Mr. Benanav says.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Brian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale.  Coach 
Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning 
to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23.  Fantasy owners should look 
elsehwere for a Fantasy QB.  Griese hasn't played in almost a month.  A 
player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team.      

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that 
have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to 
be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible.  

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar 
has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards 
and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four 
games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to 
Fantasy owners in deeper leagues.   

 Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them 
going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also 
dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up 
against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much 
as a result.  

 James Thrash , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the 
Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, 
so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league 
uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three 
man.   

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more 
than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games 
prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by 
being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take 
this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over 
the final two games.  

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win 
over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.   

 Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run 
a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy 
value at this point in the season.   

 Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He 
missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year 
career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't 
start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the 
Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being 
bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in 
your Fantasy season.   

 Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He 
rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was 
walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to 
play next Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 James McKnight , WR DAL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 
 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in 
two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback 
situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea.   

 R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several 
team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made 
several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a 
October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder 
of the season.  

 Larry Centers , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' 
Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk.   

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Klap Updated 12/11/00 
 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, 
allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the 
Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by 
this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of 
injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati 
next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs.  

 Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 
carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks 
to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point.   

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 
 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing 
for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a 
touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm 
is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to 
try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as 
Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.   

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 
 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 
346 yards.  Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from 
the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week.  If you are one 
of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to 
Fantasy glory.   

 Jeff George , QB WAS - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this 
week's game against Dallas.  The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 
passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the 
starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday 
against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins 
this week.    

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 
 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns.  He 
gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards.  With his 
performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back.   
 

 Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Top Dogs Updated 12/11/00 
 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also 
bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers 
are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team 
when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday.  

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 
 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams.  He 
will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter 
will be up for the task.  He struggled in their first meeting but still 
managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown.    

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game 
against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went 
down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving 
Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in 
the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' 
quarterbacks all together.   

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game 
against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven 
carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the 
game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of 
the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy 
value to help you at this important stage of the season.   

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday.  Look for 
Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week.  He had six catches 
for 130 yards in their first meeting this season.    

 Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three 
opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, 
could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham 
(groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. 
Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should 
hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a 
better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' 
D this week.   

 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Culpepper completed 21-of-33 passes for 221 yards and three touchdowns in a 
losing cause Sunday.  He also added an eight-yard scoring run of his own.  
Although the Vikings struggled as a team Sunday Culpepper will continue to 
help Fantasy owners for the duration of the season.    

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Coach Dick LeBeau was impressed enough with Mitchell's performance on Sunday 
against Tennessee that he named him the starting quarterback next Sunday 
against Jacksonville. The veteran QB was 12-for-26 passing for 131 yards with 
no touchdowns or interceptions, and was sacked four times. Mitchell should 
still be nowhere near your roster during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Brad Daluiso , K NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Daluiso ws good on all three of his field goal attempts on Sunday, 
converting from 38, 40 and 21 yards against Pittsburgh. He has now been 
successful on 12 consecutive attempts dating back to Week Seven against New 
York's next opponent, the Dallas Cowboys. Unless you have one of the league's 
top-notch kickers, starting Daluiso is a solid choice.    

 Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 
 Ismail seemed to be much more in synch with quarterback Trent Dilfer during 
Sunday's game against San Diego. He had six catches for 80 yards and a 
touchdown, a 28-yarder the two call a ""slugo"" (slant and go). Although it 
looked for a bit like Ismail wasn't worth a look during your playoffs, he 
could finally be at the point where he'll give you good numbers. Give him 
consideration next Sunday when he faces Arizona.

REACTION TO GOVERNOR BUSH'S STATEMENT

RE: What Gore needs to consider:
""The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like, and
that Gore requested.  Bush still won counting with Gore's
rules... [Gore has] to consider where reasonable people in the
center are going to look at this, and say, 'Guys you had your
shot, the count, the recount - they changed the rules for you
and you still did not win.'  It's time to be magnanimous.

RE: Governor Bush's Speech:
""...the tone...was perfect...

""There was a persistence and a determination in what
[Governor Bush] said, but it was also incredibly conciliatory.
It was the first kind of conciliatory speech that anybody has
given in this, and that probably goes to peoples hearts.""

     - Bob Woodward on Larry King Live, CNN, 11/26/00

STATEMENT BY GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH

The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones.  As our
nation watched, we were all reminded on a daily basis of the
importance of each and every vote.  We were reminded of the
strength of our democracy - that while our system is not always
perfect, it is fundamentally strong and far better than any
other alternative.

The election was close, but tonight, after a count, a recount
and yet another manual recount, Secretary Cheney and I are
honored and humbled to have won the state of Florida, which
gives us the needed electoral votes to win the election.  We
will therefore undertake the responsibility of preparing to
serve as America's next President and Vice President.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Shortly after I arrived here some 19 days ago, I said here in
this very room that the election process in - Florida and in
the country as a whole - needed to conclude with fairness and
finality.

I suggested that everyone step back, pause, and think about
what was at stake.  I warned that there might be no reasonable
end to the process of counts, challenges and contests if it
slipped away from us.

So here is the account of the past 3 weeks.

STATEMENT BY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER BOB CRAWFORD
Democrat Member of Florida's Election Canvassing Commission

Thank you, Madam Secretary. Let me first commend you on the job
that you and your office have done during these last almost
three weeks since the election.

This has been a tough election. It has not always been pretty.
But we got the job done, and we got it done right. People
called me and say--particularly from out of state--and say
what's going on down in Florida, and I have to keep reminding
people, the only thing that's going on here is that we've got
a razor-thin election for the most important job in the world.

And that's all it is. After all the jokes, after all of the
anguish, we've just got a close election. And any state that
had to go through this would've had the same problems, I think,
that we have had.

But I think it's over. It should be over. And maybe that's the
important word there, ""should."" You know, Yogi Berra once said,
""It's not over till it's over.'' Well, it's over, and we have a
winner, and it's time to move on.

There's one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have
enough legal talent to keep this tied up through  Christmas.
But one thing the lawyers can't do for us and one thing the
courts can't do for us: They can't bring this country together
again.

And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight,
it's going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this
country together again, and I hope we can get on with that work
soon.

And I'm proud of the job that we've done here in the state.

GORE JUST SPINNING ABOUT SUPREME COURT, SAYS EXPERT
Fox News Channel, 11/26/00

FOX NEWS' BRIT HUME: ""...does the Gore team not have something
to work with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court
coming up on Friday.  That-that creates sort of a period of
continuing, a sort of unfinality if such a word exists.""

NATIONAL JOURNAL'S STUART TAYLOR: ""...Unless I'm missing
something that is completely hollow spin.  There is nothing
what so ever, I think-that the Supreme Court of the United
States can do for Al Gore.  They could do some things for
George W. Bush, but Al Gore hasn't asked them to do anything
except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done.
But I don't think he's in the position to say, ""Oh by the way
could you order some more recounts?""  So I think there is
nothing, if...Gore runs out of ammunition.  Which I think he
may well do, before the Supreme Court of the United States gets
to a hearing.  I think he has to give up, because there's
nothing...""

Subject: Bush's Testimony


 The founder of the (web?)site said he called
Gore and  Bush  andasked them to send in their
testimonies for the web site-since they BOTH
""claim"" to be Christians.
 Gore's office said that he didn't have one in
typed  form - but Bush did.
Here it is...please pass this along!
 Very Important!!! This could change America.
 (Whether Democrat or Republican)
 If any of you are interested in what George Bush
says about his faith, here it is.
 (Alex Mooney, State Senator)
 From George W. Bush:
 ""Actually, the seeds of my decision had been
planted  the year before, by the Reverend Billy Graham.
He visited my family for a summer weekend in Maine.
I saw him preach at the small summer church,
St. Ann's by the Sea.  We all had lunch on the patio
overlooking theocean. One evening my dad asked Billy
to answer questions from a big group of family
gathered for the weekend. He sat by the fire and
talked.
  And what he said sparked a change in my heart. I
don't remember the exact words. It was more the power of
his example. The Lord was so clearly reflected in his
gentle and loving demeanor. The next day we walked
and talked at Walker's Point, and I knew I was in the
presence of a great man.  He was like a magnet; I  felt
drawn to seeksomething different. He didn't lecture
or admonish; he shared warmth and concern. Billy Graham
didn't make you feel guilty;  he made you feel  loved.
Over the course of that weekend, Reverend Graham
planted a mustard seed in  mysoul, a seed that grew
over the next year. He  led me to the path, and I  began
walking.
  It was the beginning of a change in my life. I had
always been a ""religious"" person, had regularly
attended church, even taught Sunday School.
But that weekend my faith took on a new meaning. It
was the beginning of a new walk where I would commit
my heart to Jesus Christ.
 I was humbled to learn that God sent His Son to
die for a sinner like me. I was comforted to know that
through the Son, I could find God's amazing grace,
a grace that crosses every border, every barrier and
is open to everyone.
 Through the love of Christ's life, I could understand
the life changing powers of faith.
  When I returned to Midland, I began reading the
Bible regularly.  Don Evans  talked me into joining him
and another friend, Don Jones, at a men's community
Bible study. The group had first assembled the year before,
in Spring of 1984, at the beginning of the downturn in the
energy industry.   Midland was hurting. A lot of people
were looking for comfort and strength and direction.
A couple of men started  the Bible study as a support group,
and it grew. By the time I began attending, in the fall of
1985, almost 120 men would gather. We met in small
discussion groups of ten or twelve, then joined the
larger group for full meetings.
  Don Jones picked me up every week for the meetings.
I remember looking forward to them. My interest in
reading the Bible grew stronger and stronger,
and the words became clearer and more meaningful.
We studied Acts, the story of the Apostles building the
Christian Church, and next year, the Gospel of Luke. The
preparation for each meeting took several hours,
reading the Scripture passages and thinking through
responses to discussion questions. I took it seriously,
with my usual touch of humor....Laura and I were active
members of the First Methodist Church of Midland,
and we participated in many family programs,including
James Dobson's Focus on the Family series on raising children.
As I studied and learned, Scripture took on greater meaning,
and gained confidence and understanding in my faith.
I read the Bible regularly.  Don Evans gave me the
""one-year"" Bible, a Bible divided into 365 daily readings,
each one including a section from the New Testament, the Old
Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs. I read through that Bible \
every other year. During the years in between, I pick
different chapters to study at different times.
I have also learned the power of prayer. I pray for
guidance. I do not pray for earthly things, but for
heavenly things,for wisdom and patience and understanding.
My faith gives me focus and perspective.It teaches humility.
But I also recognize that faith can be misinterpreted in
the political process. Faith is an important part
of my life. I believe it is important to live my faith,
not flaunt it.
 America is a great country because of our religious
freedoms. It is important for any leader to respect
the faith of others. That point was driven home when
Laura and I visited Israel in 1998. We had traveled to
Rome to spend Thanksgiving with our daughter, who was
attending a school program there, and spent three days in
Israel on the way home. It was an incredible experience.
I remember waking up at the Jerusalem Hilton and opening
the curtains and seeing the Old City before us,
the Jerusalem stone glowing gold. We visited the \
Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
And we went to the Sea of Galilee and stood atop the
hill where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount.
It was an overwhelming feeling to stand in the spot
where the most famous speech in the history of the world
was delivered, the spot where Jesus outlined the
character and conduct of a believer and gave
his disciples and the world the beatitudes, the
golden rule, and the Lord's Prayer.
 Our delegation included four gentile governors,
one Methodist, two Catholics, and a Mormon, and several
Jewish-American friends. Someone suggested we read
Scripture. I chose to read ""Amazing Grace,"" my favorite
hymn. Later that night we all gathered at a
restaurant in Tel Aviv for dinner before we boarded
our middle-of-night flight back to America. We talked
about the wonderful experiences and thanked the guides
and government officials who had introduced us to
their country.
 And toward the end of the meal, one of our friends
rose to share a story, to tell us how he, a gentile, and
his friend, a Jew, had (unbeknownst to the rest of us)
walked down to the Sea of Galilee,joined hands underwater,
and prayed together, on bended knee.
 Then out of his mouth came a hymn he had known as
a child, a hymn he hadn't thought about in years.
He got every word right:
         Now is the time approaching,
         by prophets long foretold,
         when all shall dwell together,
         One Shepherd and one fold.
         Now Jew and gentile, meeting,
         from many a distant shore,
         around an altar kneeling,
         one common Lord.

 Faith changes lives. I know, because faith has
changed mine."" Icould not be governor if I did not
believe in a divine plan that supersedes all human
plans. Politics is a fickle business. Polls change.
Today's friend is tomorrow's adversary. People lavish
praise and attention. Many times it is genuine;
sometimes it is not. Yet I build my life on a
foundation that will not shift. My faith frees me.
Frees me to put the problem of the moment in proper
perspective. Frees me to make decisions that others
might not like. Frees me to try to do the right
thing, even though it may not poll well...
The death penalty is a difficult issue for supporters
as well as its opponents.
 I have a reverence for life; my faith teaches that
life is a gift from our Creator. In a perfect world, life
is given by God and only taken by God. I hope someday
our society will respect life, the full spectrum of life,
from the unborn to the elderly. I hope someday unborn
children will be protected by law and welcomed in life.
I support the death penalty because I believe,
if administered swiftly and justly, capital punishment is a
deterrent against future violence and will save
other innocent lives. Some advocates of life will
challenge why I oppose abortion yet support the
death penalty.  To me, it's the difference between
innocence andguilt.
 Today, two weeks after Jeb's inauguration, in my
church in downtown Austin, Pastor Mark Craig,
was telling me that my re-election was the first
Governor to win back-to-back, four-year terms in
the history of theState of Texas.
 It was a beginning, not an end.... People are starved
for faithfulness. He talked of the need for honesty in
government. He warned that leaders who cheat on their
wives will cheat their country, will cheat
their colleagues, will cheat themselves.
 Pastor Craig said that America is starved for
honest leaders. He told the story of Moses,
asked by God to lead his people to a land of
milk and honey.  Moses had a lot of reasons to
shirk the task. As the Pastor told it, Moses'
basic reaction was, ""Sorry, God, I'm busy. I've got a
family. I've got sheep to tend. I've got a life.
""Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring
the sons of Israel out of Egypt? The people won't
believe me, he protested.  I'm not a very good
speaker. Oh, my Lord, send, I pray, some other person,
""Moses pleaded. But God did not, and Moses ultimately
did His bidding, leading his people through forty
years of wilderness and wandering, relying on God for
strength and direction and inspiration.
  ""People are starved for leadership, ""Pastor Craig
said, ""starved for leaders who have ethical and moral
courage."" ""It is not enough to have an ethical
compass to know right from wrong,""  he argued.
""America needs leaders who have the moral courage
to do what is right for the right reason.
It's not always easy or convenient for leaders to step
forward,"" he acknowledged. ""Remember, even Moses
had doubts."" ""He was talking to you,"" my mother
later said. The pastor was, of course,talking
to all of us, challenging each one of us to make
the most of our lives, to assume the mantle of
leadership and responsibility wherever we find it.
He was calling on us to use whatever power we have,
in business, in politics, in our communities, and
in our families, to do good for the right reason.
And his sermon spoke directly to my heart and my
life.... There was no magic moment of decision.
  After talking with my family during the Christmas
holidays, then hearing this rousing sermon,
to make most of every moment, during my inaugural
church service, I gradually felt more comfortable
with the prospect of a presidential campaign.
 My family would love me, my faith would sustain
me, no matter what. ""During the more than half century of
my life, we have seen an unprecedented decay in
our American culture, a decay that has eroded the
foundations of our collective values and moral
standards of conduct.
 Our sense of personal responsibility has declined
dramatically, just as the role and responsibility
of the federal government have increased.
The changing culture blurred the sharp contrast
between right and wrong and created a new standard
of conduct: 'If it feels good,do it.'
and 'If you've got a problem, blame somebody else'.
""Individuals are not responsible for their actions,""
the new culture has said. ""We are all victims of
forces beyond our control."" We have gone from a culture of
sacrifice and saving to a culture obsessed with
grabbing all the gusto. We went from accepting
responsibility to assigning blame.
As government did more and more, individuals
were required to do less and less. >The new culture said:
if people were poor, the government should feed them.
If someone had no house, the government should provide one.
If criminals are not responsible for their acts,
then the answers are not prisons, but social programs....
""For our culture to change, it must change one heart, one soul,
and one conscience at a time. Government can spend
money, but it cannot put hope in our hearts or a
sense of purpose in our lives.""... ""But government should
welcome the active involvement of people who are following a
religious imperative to love their neighbors through after
school programs, child care, drug treatment,
maternity group homes, and a range of other services.
Supporting these men and women - the soldiers in
the armies of compassion - is the next bold step of
welfare reform, because I know that changing hearts
will change our entire society.""
  ""During the opening months of my presidential
campaign, I have traveled our country and my heart has been
warmed. My experiences have reinvigorated my faith in the
greatness of Americans. They have reminded me that
societies are renewed from the bottom up, not the top down.
 Everywhere I go, I see people of love and faith,
taking time to help a neighbor in need... These people and
thousands like them are the heart and soul and greatness of
America. And I want to do my part. I am running for

America must lead. We must give our prosperity a

great nation of good and loving people.

Statement by Governor George W. Bush
November 22, 2000

""I am disappointed with last night's ruling by the Florida Supreme Court.  We 
believe the justices have used the bench to change Florida's election laws 
and usurp the authority of Florida's election officials.  We believe the 
court overreached. Writing laws is the duty of the legislature; administering 
laws is the duty of the executive branch.

""Two weeks after the presidential election, a court has decided that
Florida's deadline for counting votes and certifying votes was not a
deadline at all. The court has decided that the selective recounting of votes 
that have already been counted at least two times, and in some cases three or 
four times, will continue more than a week after the law says it should. And 
the court has ordered that the secretary of state must accept all this.

""The court had cloaked its ruling in legalistic language. But make no
mistake, the court rewrote the law. It changed the rules, and it did so after 
the election was over.

Statement by James Baker III, Senior Advisor, Bush-Cheney Recount

""At Monday's oral argument before the Florida Supreme Court,
Justice Harding asked a key question about Florida's electoral
laws and standards: ""Is it right to change the rules in the
middle of the game?""

""The Florida Supreme Court and some Democratic county electoral
boards have now decided to do just that.

Gore Has No Chance To Win Unless He Changes The Rules Again To Count
Dimpled Ballots, So...

 ~ For the past week, the Gore campaign has been saying that
   the Florida Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of
   this election.  But now that they didn't get a decision
   exactly to their liking, the Gore campaign is backpedaling
   and saying that they will leave all their options open.

 ~ In response to inquiries about whether dimpled chads can be
   counted as votes, the Florida Supreme Court cited the Hartke
   case in Illinois, but the Illinois case didn't talk about
   dimpled chads at all. It involved hanging chads, the
   standard that these three counties began using and the
   standard that they are now seeking to change.

 ~ There has been a lot of talk about statutes in Texas
   governing manual recounts.  In Texas this would all be over
   because Texas only allows one manual recount, and it has
   very clear and objective standards.  The first of those is
   when you see light coming through, and the second of those
   is where you have a hanging chad. It's only in the third
   instance that the statute in Texas speaks about any
   consideration of a dimpled chad, and it doesn't say that a
   dimpled chad can be considered standing alone. It says it
   can be considered only where it also is accompanied by a
   clearly ascertainable intent of the voter to vote.

 ~ With its decision, the Florida Supreme Court has decided
   to 'change the rules in the middle of the game.'

 ~ The Florida Supreme Court has now assumed the role of both
   the executive and legislative branches.  They effectively
   rewrote statutes that had been enacted by the Florida
   Legislature and took over responsibilities that rightly
   belonged to the Florida Secretary of State.

 ~ This decision by seven Democrat justices completely
   politicizes the vote-counting process by putting the fate
   of this election in the hands of the six Democrats, two
   independents and only one Republican that control the
   Canvassing Boards in the counties conducting manual
   recounts.

 ~ In a transparent attempt to overturn the results of this
   election, the Gore campaign is now trying to rewrite the
   rules in three counties that are still conducting manual
   recounts.

 ~ Statistical experts have said that under the current
   standards, Gore will not get enough votes to overcome
   Governor Bush's lead.  So now the Gore campaign is looking
   to change those standards in the middle of the process.

 ~ The Gore campaign wants to count ballots that have only a
   slight indentation.  No hole in the ballot is necessary.
   No single loose corner is necessary.  Not even seeing any
   light through the ballot is necessary.  This lenient
   standard has been proposed solely for Democrats to invent
   enough votes to overturn the election.

 ~ Ten years ago, the Democratic Supervisor of Elections in
   Palm Beach County issued a guideline about how ballots
   should be counted that stated, ""But a chad that is fully
   attached, bearing only an indentation, should not be
   counted as a vote.""  Now Democrats want to unfairly change
   those rules.

 ~ The Gore campaign knows that the only way to get the votes
   they need is to keep changing the rules.  This is unfair
   and unacceptable.  This election must be decided by the
   rules that existed on Election Day, not the rules
   rewritten by the Gore campaign in a politically charged
   environment two weeks later.

The Washington Post
SEND IN THE THUGS
Michael Kelly
11/22/00

Excerpt:
""Even if Gore ultimately loses in Florida, he will have come
very, very close to winning. Moreover, he will have done this
with his image-skin more or less intact. For Gore has already
won an astonishing propaganda victory: With the help of
reasonably sympathetic coverage from a largely Democratic and
liberal national press corps, he has managed to spin his
extraordinary, radical, unprecedented behavior as reasonable -
and legitimate. This probably ensures that future close
presidential elections will produce future Gore Losers,
marching off to the courts and the cameras with their armies
of lawyers and thugs, demanding recounts, rewriting the rules
and the laws, convincing more and more Americans that their
electoral system is, like those in most of the world, just
another rigged game.

Thanks, Al, we needed that.""

The Palm Beach Post
Gore's Point Man Argued Against Dimples in 1996
Joel Engelhardt, Palm Beach Post
11/22/00

Excerpts:
""Amid the swarm of the world press outside the county Emergency
Operations Center, Dennis Newman leads the charge to find new
votes for Al Gore in the dimples of the Palm Beach County
ballot.

""His argument, put simply, is that dimples show the true intent
of the voter. Voters caused those dimples. Dimples should count.

""Four years ago, in a similar election spat, Newman took a much
different stand. Employing his best legal tactics on behalf of
a Democrat holding a slight lead in a primary race for
Congress, Newman scoffed at the idea of counting the tiny
indentations as votes.

""Like the Republicans watching now, Newman wondered out loud how
ballots that had been handled over and over, in recount after
recount, could still be impartially judged. Couldn't the
ballots -- and therefore the votes -- be affected by all that
touching and grabbing?

Thousands more Americans have signed their Petition to
Certify the Bush Victory at
http://www.electionIntegrity2000.com . We=01,re building a tidal
wave of public support for fairness and integrity in the
aftermath of this presidential election.

Make no mistake, Al Gore=01,s team of lawyers and activists are
fighting to the finish in a desperate attempt to overturn the
results in Florida.  Here=01,s the latest:

After hand picking Florida counties to conduct recount after
recount and using the Florida Supreme Court to help them
rewrite the election rules, it still didn=01,t look like Al Gore
was going to be able to manufacture enough votes to win.  But
they want this election and they=01,re not giving up without a
fight.

Statistically, early returns from the manual recounts (hand-
counts) did not show Al Gore overtaking George W. Bush=01,s lead
in Florida.  So the Democrats have simply changed the
""hand-counting"" rules again.  The new rules say that ballots
with dimples, loose chad or any indentation in the area of
the box should be counted.

No punch hole in the ballot is necessary for Gore to gain
a vote!

This amounts to mind reading because the activists conducting
the recount are allowed to divine the intent of the voter.

Gore=01,s team argues that ""every vote should be counted"" hoping
to gain votes in their favor, but they use every technicality
to disqualify thousands of military ballots delivered without
a post mark.  Why?

Because these ballots likely favor Bush at a rate of 2 to 1!

And even though military servicemen abroad can=01,t control how
their mail is delivered, Gore=01,s allies are fighting to deny
their votes.

We the American people must fight this systematic and
calculated effort to overturn the election.  We must fight
in the media.  We must fight in the courts.  We must fight
in the Florida legislature.  We must fight for public
opinion.

One way you can help is by urging your friends and family to
join our online campaign to Certify the Bush Victory at

article   http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/brnx1121b.htm   ""This is the
kind of season it has been for Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis: He
has twice as many magnetic resonance imaging tests as touchdowns.
Davis underwent his fourth MRI on Monday and, like the previous three, the
results were negative. Yet Davis still is concerned enough about his lower
left leg, which has been bothering him for nearly a month and wants a
specialist in San Francisco to study the results.
""It's just kind of a cross-check with a guy that's known to be pretty good,""
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ""He's still quite sore, and we want to
make sure that we rule out all possibilities.""
But not even the specialist in San Francisco will be able to predict whether
Davis will be able to play Sunday in Seattle, or any time in the near
future.
""I thought he was going to play this last week; then he set it back and
didn't practice Saturday morning,"" Shanahan said. ""I don't think anybody
knows. We just have to wait and see.""
At this point, the Broncos are carrying on as if rookie running backs Mike
Anderson and KaRon Coleman will be carrying the load. ""You've got to,""
Shanahan said. ""If he's there, it's a plus, and we'd like him to be there
full speed.
""But he keeps on setting that leg back. How long that pain's going to be
there I don't think anybody knows. We'll just have to go on. Mike Anderson
did a great job last game, played exceptionally well, and he has got to pick
up the slack.''



My View:   Mike Shanahan is no Bill Belichick, when it comes to coachspeak,
but he's not far behind.  He's saying basically the only things he can say.
If I'm a Terrell Davis owner, I probably sit him this week unless I just
didn't have many other options.  I'd say the chances of him playing
effectively this week are in the 40% range.  Anderson had 138 total yards
Sunday.  He ran for 97 yards on 19 carries for a 5.1 yard per carry average.
And that was against a San Diego rush defense that was ranked # 2 in rushing
yards allowed per game over the last four games.  In other words, the
running game isn't a big problem for Mike Shanahan right now.  He's got
other things to worry about (like replacing CB Ray Crockett).  The fact they
haven't been able to nail down the exact problem is worrisome to me.  Bottom
line is I'm thinking Anderson as of right now.

Good Luck!

Joe

I know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a
crazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a
lot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a
mad dash on weeks like this.


Here's the latest on Stephen Davis:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa
shingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington
Post.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a
hairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen
Davis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play
Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.
According to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack
in Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the
Redskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the
injury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point
at which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.
""It hurts now,"" Davis said. ""It's something I have to overcome. They told me
it's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.
[But] I'm hopeful.""
Davis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But
Tyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent
another yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for
85 yards on 19 carries.
""It didn't affect me at all,"" he said. ""We ran the ball a couple times after
it happened and did okay.""
Skip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the
Eagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on
the inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is
sidelined or limited.
The Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive
starters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,
center Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's
third-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with
10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.
Turner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to
the ball. ""That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury,"" Turner
said. ""Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it.""

My View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's
going to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes
anyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll
see Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on
it, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the
Eagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing
allowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the
""tough guy"" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played
Monday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he
played with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about ""leaders stepping
up"" and such.  Stephen Davis' injury appears to be primarily an issue of
managing the pain and I'd be very surprised to see him sit after Green's
performance.
Thanks to my friend J.D. Gardner for his help on this one.

 Trent Green , QB STL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/22/00 
 Green will get one more week as the team's starter.  He will start this 
Sunday vs. New Orleans, but Kurt Warner  is expected to return for the 
December 3rd game at Carolina.  This won't be the last you've heard from 
Green.  There has been talk that he will take his services elsewhere next 
year in hopes of obtaining a starting job.  For now look for Green to put up 
big numbers against the Saints defense this week.  New Orleans has a strong 
pass rush but their corners won't be able to contain the Rams' receivers long 
enough for them to pressure Green.    

 Lions , DT DET - FDIC Updated 11/22/00 
 Detroit had one of the top pass rushes in the NFL last year but are 
currently among the worst garnering a mere 22 sacks.   The Lions could be 
primed for a turnaround in the final games of the season.  Detroit's pass 
rush has been much improved since the resignation of head coach Bobby Ross.  
Robert Porcher has played especially well in the last two games tallying five 
sacks and forcing a fumble.  Look for them to have a field day against the 
Patriots Sunday.  New England has allowed an astonishing 38 sacks this 
season.     

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 An MRI on Bates knee showed no structural damage and he is expected to play 
against the Patriots Thursday.  Bates has been a reliable third-down back for 
the Lions but hasn't provided much help for Fantasy teams this season.  Don't 
expect that to change when he faces the Patriots Thursday.     

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/22/00 
 Stewart was able to practice Tuesday and will play in Thursday's game 
against the Patriots.  He suffered a hip-pointer injury Sunday that forced 
him to miss Monday's practice.  Don't be surprised if Stewart struggles 
against the Patriots.  If he isn't full strength he may have a hard time 
avoiding New England's linebackers.   

 Marlon Barnes , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Barnes gained 11 yards on three carries against the Buccaneers Sunday.  
Starter James Allen will be back in the lineup once again this week after 
cutting his hand in last Sunday's game.  Barnes will resume his role as a 
third-down back.  He has played sparingly this season but could have a larger 
role in the offense next year.      

 Eddie Kennison , WR CHI - Murder Inc. Updated 11/22/00 
 Kennison has been a major disappointment as the Bears' second receiver this 
season catching just one touchdown pass through 11 games.  Things won't get 
any better this week when he faces a stingy Jets pass defense.  New York has 
only given up 11 passing TDs all season.  Kennison may get a few catches this 
week but don't expect him to score for your team.  At this point it would be 
wise to bench him if you haven't already.     

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Edinger has been on a roll lately making nine of his last ten field goals.  
He could have another big week against the Jets this week.  The Bears 
shouldn't have any problems moving the chains -the Jets have given up a lot 
of yards this season but have managed to keep the opposition out of the end 
zone.  New York's defense has also seen opposing offenses attempt an 
NFL-leading 28 field goals.  If Edinger can remain accurate in the swirling 
New Jersey winds, he will have a big game.     

 Bears , DT CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Look for the Bears secondary to contribute a few interceptions for your 
Fantasy team this week as Chicago faces the Jets and QB Vinny Testaverde this 
week.  Testaverde has thrown two or more interceptions in his last five 
games.  But if the Bears don't put any pressure on Testaverde and Curtis 
Martin they will rip the defense apart.  Chicago has a weak pass rush and an 
even softer run defense.    

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Hearst has been added to the 49ers' active  roster.  Head coach Steve 
Mariucci says he probably won't get into a game this season, so it wouldn't 
be wise to pick Hearst up as a free agent.  He had spent the entire year on 
the physically-unable-to-perform list after missing all of last season while 
recovering from a career-threatening ankle injury.  Keep an eye on Hearst 
though.  If his condition continues to progress he could be a sleeper pick 
next year.    

 Tony Horne , WR STL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Horne, one of the league's best kick returners, will be out for four to six 
weeks after breaking a bone in his right foot during Monday night's game 
against Washington. He had a 24.2-yard average on kickoff returns, including 
a 103-yard touchdown. The Rams may use Az-Zahir Hakim, their punt returner, 
on kickoffs, but are more likely to sign someone.  

 Charles Kirby , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Mike Alstott now out for at least the remainder of the regular season, 
Kirby is the only remaining true fullback on the Buccaneers' roster. Still, 
he was promoted from the practice squad just two weeks ago merely to serve as 
a blocker in short-yardage situations, so don't expect him to come close to 
the 12 carries per game Alstott was averaging. Warrick Dunn will be the 
primary focus of the running game.  

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 Faulk made an impressive return from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee 
last night against Washington, making nine catches for 88 yards and a 
touchdown while rushing for 33 yards on nine carries. He had the surgery just 
14 days prior, so the Rams were light on his rushing load, but Faulk looked 
solid in his first game back. Expect him to be close to full strength when 
the Rams play New Orleans on Sunday.  

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Steelers have activated Blackwell from the physically unable to perform 
list and placed him on their 53-man roster. He was placed on that list July 
16 after suffering a May knee injury, and is an unrestricted free agent after 
the season. Still, don't count on much, if any, Fantasy value from Blackwell. 
 

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Lions are awaiting results of an MRI performed on Bates' injured knee, 
which he sustained during Sunday's game against the Giants. He is less likely 
to play Thursday against New England than first-stringer James Stewart.  

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/21/00 
 Stewart was unable to practice with the team yesterday after suffering a hip 
pointer in Sunday's game against the Giants. With the Lions' next game coming 
Thursday against New England, there isn't much time for him to heal. Coach 
Gary Moeller thinks Stewart will be able to play through the injury. His 
status is more critical with backup Mario Bates also ailing. If neither can 
go, fullback Cory Schlesinger, running back Sedrick Irvin and special teams 
member Brock Olivo would fill in.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Despite a sprained left knee that required a brace and had him limping 
yesterday, Mitchell is still hopeful he can play Sunday against Pittsburgh. 
He is listed on the injury report as doubtful after suffering a sprained MCL 
during last Sunday's game against New England, but an MRI performed yesterday 
revealed no damage. If Mitchell can play, he will get the start. He'll very 
likely play if it's physically possible.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Allen will not miss practice this week 
after suffering a cut on his right hand during Sunday's game against Tampa 
Bay. He should be ready to play next Sunday against the Jets.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Shane Matthews performing well as the starter, the Bears can afford to 
be patient with McNown as he recovers from a separated left shoulder. He 
threw 15-yard passes with Matthews before Sunday's game against Tampa Bay and 
will participate in some drills tomorrow. McNown could serve as the third 
quarterback next Sunday against the Jets.   

 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/21/00 
 Chandler might lose some playing time over the season's final weeks, as the 
Falcons try to evaluate rookie Doug Johnson for their future. This isn't a 
condemnation of the veteran Chandler, but his owners should make sure he's 
going to start each week before giving him the nod.  

 Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Falcons might consider giving Johnson some playing time over the 
season's final weeks, as the team decides whether he can serve as the QB of 
the future or if one will need to be taken in next year's draft. If he is 
given a shot, those in keeper leagues should keep a close eye on his 
performance.  

 Obafemi Ayanbadejo , RB BAL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Ayanbadejo will likely be inactive for Sunday's game against Cleveland. With 
Baltimore's bye week coming up after that, he will get an extra week to rest, 
and should be ready to roll against San Diego in Week 15.  

 Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Meximullets Updated 11/21/00 
 The Eagles' signal caller is really maturing right before our eyes.  He 
completed 25-of-34 passes for 217 yards and accounted for two touchdowns in 
Sunday's win over Arizona.  He will need to keep his composure next week 
against the Redskins, as the two teams battle for first place in the NFC 
East.  The Eagles will need a huge performance from McNabb if they are to 
beat Washington, so give him a start this week in the big game.    

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 Connell caught five passes for 96 yards in Monday night's win over the 
Rams.  Washington will face a tough Eagles' secondary next week, which will 
be looking to keep their team in first place in the NFC East.  If the 'Skins 
can establish their running game early, Connell could have a big game.      

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/21/00 
 George was very impressive in Monday night's big win over St. Louis.  He 
completed 24-of-34 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns against the 
Rams, further clouding the quarterback situation in Washington.  Starter Brad 
Johnson should know by Thursday if he is able to play next week against the  
Eagles, so keep tabs on his progress in the coming days if you have either of 
these players on your roster.    

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis accounted for 106 yards of total offense but didn't score a touchdown 
as Washington defeated St. Louis 33-20 on Monday night. It was the first time 
in seven weeks that Davis had been held out of the end zone. Look for the 
'Skins to establish Davis early in the game next week against the Eagles in 
an effort to open up their passing game.     

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  ""We'll see Wednesday or Thursday,"" said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, ""but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play.""    

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.

He is listed on the injury report as doubtful after suffering a sprained MCL 
during last Sunday's game against New England, but an MRI performed yesterday 
revealed no damage. If Mitchell can play, he will get the start. He'll very 
likely play if it's physically possible.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Allen will not miss practice this week 
after suffering a cut on his right hand during Sunday's game against Tampa 
Bay. He should be ready to play next Sunday against the Jets.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/21/00 
 With Shane Matthews performing well as the starter, the Bears can afford to 
be patient with McNown as he recovers from a separated left shoulder. He 
threw 15-yard passes with Matthews before Sunday's game against Tampa Bay and

the future or if one will need to be taken in next year's draft. If he is 
given a shot, those in keeper leagues should keep a close eye on his 
performance.  

 Obafemi Ayanbadejo , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Ayanbadejo will likely be inactive for Sunday's game against Cleveland. With 
Baltimore's bye week coming up after that, he will get an extra week to rest, 
and should be ready to roll against San Diego in Week 15.  

 Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 The Eagles' signal caller is really maturing right before our eyes.  He 
completed 25-of-34 passes for 217 yards and accounted for two touchdowns in 
Sunday's win over Arizona.  He will need to keep his composure next week 
against the Redskins, as the two teams battle for first place in the NFC

be looking to keep their team in first place in the NFC East.  If the 'Skins 
can establish their running game early, Connell could have a big game.      

 Jeff George , QB WAS - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 George was very impressive in Monday night's big win over St. Louis.  He 
completed 24-of-34 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns against the 
Rams, further clouding the quarterback situation in Washington.  Starter Brad 
Johnson should know by Thursday if he is able to play next week against the  
Eagles, so keep tabs on his progress in the coming days if you have either of 
these players on your roster.    

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis accounted for 106 yards of total offense but didn't score a touchdown 
as Washington defeated St. Louis 33-20 on Monday night. It was the first time 
in seven weeks that Davis had been held out of the end zone. Look for the 
'Skins to establish Davis early in the game next week against the Eagles in 
an effort to open up their passing game.     

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  ""We'll see Wednesday or Thursday,"" said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, ""but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good

 Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - FIBSABs Updated 11/21/00 
 The status of the Jets' running back for this week's game against the Bears 
is still uncertain.  Martin left Sunday's game in Miami with what was 
described as a strained back, and never returned to the field.  He had an 
examination by team doctors yesterday, and had some X-rays taken as well.  
The club hasn't released any information on the resluts of the exam.  If 
Martin is on your Fantasy squad, your best bet is to stay tuned as the week 
progresses.     

 Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/00 
 According to New York Newsday , Coles will be unable to play in this week's 
game against the Bears.  He was hit on the knee during the opening kickoff of 
the second half in Sunday's win over the Dolphins.  If Coles is an integral 
part of your roster, look to pick up Dedric Ward, who should get more playing 
time in Coles' absence.    

 Billy Joe Tolliver , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints re-signed Tolliver yesterday, after the 10-year veteran had been 
cut by the team during training camp. With Jeff Blake out for the season, New 
Orleans needed a No. 3 quarterback, so Tolliver will fill that role behind 
starter Aaron Brooks and backup Jake Delhomme.  

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints placed Blake on injured reserve yesterday, officially ending his 
season. He will have surgery on his fractured and dislocated right foot as 
soon as the swelling subsides and the extent of the damage is determined. 
Blake will be replaced by Aaron Brooks.  

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith's status is still not certain, but he does expect to return for 
Sunday's game against the Colts.  He left last week's game against the Jets 
after aggravating his strained right hamstring, an injury which he sustained 
a week earlier against the Chargers.  Smith has been one of the year's 
biggest Fantasy sleepers, and has become an everyday starter for those 
Fantasy owners who were lucky enough to grab him.  If he does in fact play 
this week, be sure to include him in your starting lineup.    

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/00 
 Although his status is still up in the air, Fiedler expects that he will be 
ready to play in Sunday's AFC showdown against the Colts.  Fiedler was 
injured on the first play of the Jets' game when linebacker Mo Lewis drove 
his head and shoulder into the turf. He suffered a slightly seperated 
throwing shoulder and developed muscle spasms in his back.  Fielder isn't one 
of the better options in the Fantasy game, so avoid playing him this week 
even if he does start.  

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - FIBSABs Updated 11/21/00 
 The Redskins should know by Thursday if Johnson can re-assume his starting 
job for this week's showdown against the Eagles.  He has started to test his 
injured left knee with some light dropbacks and will likely push the knee 
harder during practice on Wednesday and Thursday.    

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With the injury to Ike Hilliard, Jurevicius will likely start this week's 
game at Arizona.  With only 12 receptions on the entire season, Jurevicius 
isn't a solid Fantasy option, so don't pick him up unless your roster is 
really straped for receivers.

 Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon. =

Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by De=

Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy=
=20
when he returns before you pick him up.   =20

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When h=
e=20
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the=
=20
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a=
=20
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you=
=20
to let him go.   =20

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00=20
 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised=
=20
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't=
=20
played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want t=
o=20
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.   =
=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a=20
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to=
=20
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one =
of=20
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game t=
o=20
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy=
=20
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns=
=20
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.   =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game=20
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading=20
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has=
=20
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00=20
 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the=
=20
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of=20
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two=20
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per=20
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill shou=
ld=20
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis i=
n=20
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until=20
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major=20
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5=
=20
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another=
=20
viable option is open to you.   =20

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/11/00=20
 Marbury, who has missed New Jersey's last four games with a sprained ankle=
,=20
expects to return to the court for the Nets' Tuesday night contest against=
=20
his former team, the Minnesota Timberwolves. ""I'm playing Tuesday.=20
Absolutely,"" said Marbury. ""I know it's going to hurt. I've gotten to the=
=20
point where I feel like I'm confortable.""  Unless you have two solid guards=
=20
with four-game schedules, it would be wise to get Marbury back into your=20
starting lineup this week.   =20

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the=20
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't=
=20
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The=20
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scori=
ng=20
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to tho=
se=20
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit=
=20
Atkins if your roster allows it.   =20

 Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surger=
y=20
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured=
=20
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game=20
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland=20
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Mill=
er=20
and Brevin Knight.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00=20
 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games wi=
th=20
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in=20
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights=
=20
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes=
=20
occur. =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions=
=20
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on t=
he=20
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reported=
ly=20
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have=
=20
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will=
=20
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was=20
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who ha=
s=20
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive=
=20
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.  =20

 Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over =
a=20
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a ""leave"" by the te=
am=20
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds =
in=20
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is=20
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.  =20

 Kenny Anderson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 The Celtics activated Anderson on Sunday and placed guard Chris Carr on th=
e=20
injured list with a sprained left ankle.   Anderson had been on the injured=
=20
list since Nov. 6 with a fractured jaw. He had a wire removed from his jaw=
=20
Dec. 6 and was cleared to practice Dec. 7. He missed 16 games with the=20
injury.   =20

 Erick Strickland , G NY - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Strickland sat out Saturday's home game against Denver due to a bruised=20
leg.  He was a valuable Fantasy player as a member of the Dallas Mavericks=
=20
last season but is limited now by his lack of playing time with the Knicks.=
  =20
=20

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Davis missed his second straight start for the Sonics because of a spraine=
d=20
ankle. Forward Ruben Patterson started in place of Davis, with Rashard Lewi=
s=20
moving to shooting guard.  Davis is a solid ballhandler and defender but=20
doesn't have much Fantasy value.   =20

 Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primaril=
y=20
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game =
at=20
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use i=
n=20
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.   =20

 Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley. =20
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily =
as=20
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value. =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a=
=20
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven=
=20
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the=20
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotatio=
n=20
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.    =20

 Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He=
=20
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will=20
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positi=
ve=20
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt=20
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder und=

the current conditions.   =20

 Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injur=
ed=20
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing=
=20
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.    =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur=

on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rook=
ie=20
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for=20

with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of t=
he=20
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.   =
 =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return =
to=20
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  ""Oak,"" who wa=

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00=20
 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though=
=20
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State=20
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting abou=

15978,bass-e/all_documents/360.,<6972346.1075854584304.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Getting lots of questions on Martin.  Nothing definitive yet, but here's the
latest I have from the New York Daily News by By Rich Cimini:
http://www.nydailynews.com/2000-11-22/Metro_Sports/Football/a-89509.asp
From the article:  ""The Jets provided no update yesterday on Curtis Martin,
but his injury isn't believed to be serious. His status for Sunday's game
against the Bears remains in doubt. It appears that Martin was drilled in
the tailbone by a Dolphins defender. It swelled up on the team flight back
from Miami, and ice was applied. Al Groh has declined to provide specifics,
except to say the injury occurred in the ""general pelvic region.""
The Jets' star running back, who underwent intensive treatment yesterday,
has told several people that he's fine. He's known for his high pain
threshold, and it wouldn't shock teammates if he played this week.

My View:  Players are notorious for being optimistic but Martin is a tough
guy.  Another reason why these Thursday games are so tough.  If you wanted
waffling, you wouldn't be signed up for this newsletter so I'm going to say
as of Wednesday morning, I think the chances he plays effectively as
normally would are 75%.
Thanks to my friend Nicholas Bollini for assistance on this one.
Good Luck this weekend.

As promised, here are two deals you can gobble up for savings--$328
roundtrip to your choice of 15 Caribbean cities for travel through June 15
AND coast-to-coast U.S. travel for $198 roundtrip, or less.

Most of us are busy preparing for the Thanksgiving holiday and clearing
the decks for a  four-day weekend. Bestfares.com will be posting new deals
throughout the holiday, but we=01,ll make this newsletter short and sweet,
whet your appetite with the best of our specials and leave you with room
for delicious desserts of deals. Our hot, new Caribbean sale can save you
up to 60 percent in the most popular travel season, and you still have
time for last-minute savings on Turkey fares. Without further ado, we=01,ll
serve up our buffet of bargains.

50 U.S. CITIES TO 15 CARIBBEAN CITIES FROM $328 RT
Bestfares.com offers members a chance to perk up in a Caribbean paradise
with peak season fares beginning at only $328 roundtrip for travel through
June 15, 2001. We are having one knockout of a sale to 15 Caribbean cities
with airfares discounted by up to $500 for the high winter season, when
many travelers want to warm themselves under the tropical sun. We=01,ll war=
m
your body and protect your wallet with solar savings. From Eastern and
Southeastern cities, roundtrips are only $328; from the Midwest, $428; and
from the West Coast, just $458. These specials are valid to Caribbean
treasures including St. Maarten, San Juan, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Aruba,
Montego Bay, Grand Cayman, Cancun, Bermuda and Santo Domingo. We=01,ll also

SUPER $198 RT SALE COAST-TO-COAST BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES
This past week, we watched business travelers get hit with their sixth
fare hike of the year. Some routes of over 1,500 miles have increased by
as much as $370 roundtrip since January 1, 2000. Fight back with our
leisure fares from select U.S. cities that let you fly coast to coast for
as little as $198 roundtrip through March 30, 2001 (travel to Florida
markets is valid through March 14). For example, fly from Seattle to
Orlando or San Diego to Baltimore. You have many options for travel
throughout the nation. Tickets must be purchased by December 1, 2000. Get
back some of the money the airlines have gotten for your business trips by
using our coast-to-coast $198 Super Sale fares. Access more information at
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898

THERE=01,S STILL TIME TO FLY ON TURKEY DAY FROM $59 RT
The trick to getting a great fare for those last minute home for the
holiday flights is to travel on Thursday and return on Friday. These
specials are valid for travel throughout both days, but availability is
best for travel later in the day on Thanksgiving, and return travel early
in the day on Friday. You can enjoy a late meal with your family, pack up
some leftovers and be home in time to rest up over the weekend. These
deals start at $59 (New York City to Boston, for example). You can travel
coast to coast from $151. Fares are based on one-way mileage: 250 miles
for $64 to $79 roundtrip; 251-500 miles for $79 to $99 roundtrip; 501-750
miles for $103 to $129 roundtrip; 751-1,000 miles for $119 to $149
roundtrip; 1,001-1,250 miles for $139 to $169 roundtrip; and over 1,250
miles for $151 to $189 roundtrip. Get the big end of the holiday dinner

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Jake Voskuhl , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Voskuhl was placed on the injured list by Chicago with a right hip flexor 
strain today. One of the Bulls second-round picks in the June draft, Voskuhl 
was averaging 1.3 points and 1.5 rebounds in four games this season.  

 Dalibor Bagaric , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Bulls today activated Bagaric, the 24th pick overall in the June draft. 
He had missed Chicago's first 10 games with a bruised right knee. Bagaric 
averaged 18.3 points and 10.4 rebounds for Benston Zagreb of the Croatian 
League last year.  

 Randy Livingston , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Warriors waived Livingston today, less than one week after signing him 
as a free agent. He had appeared in only two games and was expendable with 
the return of Bob Sura from injury.  

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Warriors activated Sura from the injured list today. He had been 
sidelined all season with a lower back injury suffered during training camp. 
The 27-year-old was acquired in June from Cleveland via Milwaukee in a 
three-team deal, after he had posted a career-high 13.8 point-per-game 
average with the Cavaliers.  

 Bruno Sundov , C IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Pacers activated Sundov from the injured list after placing Tyus Edney 
on the same list today. The 20-year-old center had been sidelined all season 
with a sprained left ankle.  

 Tyus Edney , G IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Pacers placed Edney on the injured list today with plantar fasciatis in 
his left foot. The 5-10, 152-pound center will miss a minimum of five games. 
He was averaging 3.4 points and 1.9 assists in eight games this season.  

 Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Thorpe received a cortisone shot in his ailing left foot, and he will be 
sidelined another four weeks. He was placed on the injured list on Thursday 
after averaging 3.0 points and 1.7 rebounds in six games.  

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/21/00 
 Camby had an MRI during Sunday's game which confirmed that he only has a 
sprained ankle.  He turned the ankle in Friday night's win over Phoenix.  He 
is listed as day to day, and it is unclear whether he will begin playing 
tonight or tomorrow. Camby has been the best center in the Eastern Confernece 
thus far, so make sure to start him as soon as he returns to the lineup.    

 Terrell Brandon , G MIN - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 Brandon, who has missed four games with an ankle sprain, practiced for the 
first time on Monday since being hurt on Nov. 9.  He said he might return to 
the lineup when the Timberwolves host the Vancouver Grizzlies on Wednesday 
night.     

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 After initially expecting a return to the court tonight against Cleveland, 
it seems that Jones will miss at least tonight's game - and likely more. ""The 
doctor told me flat out,"" Jones said, ""it's going to be awhile.""  Jones tried 
to participate in drills yesterday, but his injured calf continued to tighten 
on him.  If Jones is on your roster, it's a good idea to keep him on the 
bench until his prognosis is a bit more clear.    

 Dirk Nowitzki , F DAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/21/00 
 Nowitzki re-aggravated a left shoulder injury in the third quarter of Monday 
night's game against the Jazz.  He left the game and did not return, but did 
post 20 points and 14 rebounds before exiting.  He is not expected to miss 
any time because of the injury.  Nowitzki is establishing himself as a real 
Fantasy star, so continue to start him as long as his shoulder holds up.    

 Rex Chapman , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Chapman announced his retirement Monday because of a series of injuries.  He 
underwent surgery on his right wrist before training camp and began the 
season on the injured list.  Chapman is also scheduled to have ankle surgery 
soon.     

 Todd Day , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Day was activated from the injured list Friday.  Guard Sam Jacobsen was 
placed on the list to make room for Day.  Day was a key reserve for the Suns 
in 1999-2000 but was sidelined for the first few weeks this season due to a 
knee injury.  He will be a valuable reserve for the T'Wolves as well but 
won't help a Fantasy team too much.     

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Skinner was placed on the injured list after hurting his ankle.  Zendon 
Hamilton was activated to replace Skinner on the roster.  Skinner has been 
somewhat of a disappointment this season averaging 5.8 points and 4.7 
rebounds per game.     

 Jeff McInnis , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 McInnis is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nets after 
suffering a bruised knee against the Sonics Saturday.  Rookie Keyon Dooling 
is expected to get his first start at point guard for the Clippers.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Williams played 26 minutes in Saturday's game against the Suns, scoring four 
points and grabbing seven rebounds.  He had missed Thursday's game against 
the Hornets because of a hip and groin injuries.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Del Negro played eight minutes in Sunday's loss to the Knicks.  He had 
missed the Warriors previous two games due to a sprained ankle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Buckner re-injured his right foot and is expected to be sidelined for at 
least a week.  Hubert Davis is expected to start at shooting guard in his 
absence.    

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Dickerson is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nuggets due 
to a sprained ankle.  Look for veteran Kevin Edwards to start at shooting 
guard in his place.    

 Doug West , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 West's strained right shoulder has healed and head coach Sidney Lowe is 
expected to activate him from the injured list this week.  Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 
is expected to be placed on the injured list to make room for West.  

 Shareef Abdur-Rahim , F VAN - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/20/00 
 Abdur-Rahim is expected to play in Monday's game against Vancouver.  He 
missed Saturday's game to be with his sick mother in Atlanta.  If he doesn't 
make it back to Vancouver in time rookie Stromile Swift could get a rare 
start at small forward.    

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 MacCulloch was placed on the injured list Monday with an ankle injury.  With 
the return of Matt Geiger, MacCulloch's already low Fantasy value diminishes 
even further.     

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/20/00 
 Geiger has been activated off the injured list, and could see some playing 
time in tonight's game in Boston.  With Geiger's return, the Sixers placed 
center Todd McCulloch on the injured list.  If you have Geiger on your 
Fantasy roster, give him some time to get back into game shape before putting 
him in your starting lineup.    

 Tim Thomas , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Thomas disclosed on Saturday that he is having some real discomfort in his 
left knee, and it is getting worse with each game that he plays. Thomas has 
started off slow, but didn't want to use the injury as an excuse.  ""It's very 
painful at times,"" said Thomas. ""The only thing I can do is keep getting rest 
as much as possible.""  The Bucks can ill-afford to lose Thomas; they have 
already lost starting forward Darvin Ham and backup forward Scott Williams 
this season.  If Thomas is on your Fantasy squad, it might be a good idea to 
keep in on the bench until his condition improves.      

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Jones has missed three straight games with a right calf sprain, but says 
that he expects to play on Wednesday night against Cleveland. Jones has 
averaged 16.9 points through his first seven games in Miami.     

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/20/00 
 Rose his hoping to make his season debut on Tuesday night against the 
Rockets, but he's not making any promises.  He was suppose to return to 
action last week, but the team's medical personnel advised him to wait a bit 
longer before hitting the court.  If Rose is on your roster, give him at 
least another week before putting him into your starting lineup.    

 Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 The Detroit Pistons announced on Monday morning that they had come to terms 
with Smith, on what is believed to be a one-year deal for the NBA's mid-level 
exception of $2.25 million (pro-rated after 11 games).  Smith had reportedly  
agreed to re-sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum 
of $611,000 last week.  He will eventually be the Pistons starting center but 
will probably spend the next few weeks inmproving his conditioning.  There is 
no need to rush and try to acquire Smith.  He has been a solid reserve 
at-best throughout his career.  If you have him on your Fantasy team wait 
awhile before you insert him into your lineup.     

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/20/00 
 Camby turned his ankle during Friday night's victory in Phoenix. X-rays 
taken on his ankle were negative, then Camby underwent an MRI as a 
precautionary measure. He missed Sunday night's game against the Warriors, 
and is listed as day to day.       

 Tim Hardaway , G MIA - The Old School Fools Updated 11/19/00 
 Hardaway, plagued by knee ailments for the past two seasons, sat out 
Saturday night's game against the Portland Trail Blazers with tendinitis in 
his right knee. Hardaway said he expects to play in Miami's next game 
Wednesday against Cleveland.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00 
 O'Neal, bothered by a sprained left ankle and a sore Achilles' tendon, was 
not in uniform Saturday night as the Los Angeles Lakers played the Denver 
Nuggets.  His status is day-to-day.  O'Neal said he was injured when someone 
fell on his leg in the first quarter of Thursday night's overtime victory at 
Sacramento. Greg Foster took O'Neal's place in the starting lineup.

15982,bass-e/all_documents/364.,<28270440.1075854584498.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Hi Folks, 
?
Just a few quick notes on this short Thanksgiving  week.
?
?
?
No Problems for Faulk / Kurt Warner  One more Week:? From USA Today's?Ram's 
Page:? ""In other  injury news, Marshall Faulk experienced no problems with 
his right knee the day  after the game. Martz said quarterback Kurt Warner 
almost certainly would miss  one more game before returning from a broken 
little finger on his throwing hand.  Two pins were removed from Warner's 
finger Monday and he'll throw Wednesday  through Friday in practice, but will 
not take any snaps. ''(The doctors) want  him to have another week before 
that hand is jarred by anything, just to make  sure it sets real well,'' 
Martz said. 
?
It should be noted that Warner is more optimistic  about playing than his 
coach is.? Don't take the coach's word as  gospel.? Remember, it was Martz 
who?a few days ago?was saying  Faulk likely wouldn't play Monday night and if 
he did, he'd be very  limited.? I'm not saying he's less than truthful.? I'm 
saying these  things change.? If I had to guess though, I'd say it's one more 
week of  Trent Green.
?
?
?
Tony Horne Out 6 Weeks:? From  USA Today: Tony Horne will be sidelined an 
estimated six weeks with a ligament  damage to his left big toe. Coach Mike 
Martz described the injury Tuesday as  ''severe turf toe.''? He'll likely be 
replaced by CB Dre Bly.
?
?
Ray Crockett Hamstring:?  Denver CB Ray Crockett tore his hamstring Sunday.? 
You may have seen it  when he went down and Ryan Leaf was able to hit Jeff 
Graham for the long  TD.? It looked pretty bad.? I thought he'd dislocated 
his hip the way  he pulled up.? Jimmy Spencer will fill in.?That hurts as the 
team gets  ready for Seattle.? The Seahawks are no passing juggernaut but 
neither were  the Chargers...
?
?
Mike Alstott Done? Tampa Bay  is calling Mike Alstott's knee injury a 3rd 
degree sprain of the medial  collateral ligament (MCL) and he'll likely miss 
6-8 weeks which of course means  he's done for FF purposes.? His leg is being 
placed in a cast for 10  days.? Surgery doesn't look to be required and it's 
a tough blow for the  big guy.? Look for more carries from Warrick Dunn.
?
?
Curtis Martin  Questions?? I've had a ton of requests for more info on the  
Curtis Martin situation which is now being called a hip injury instead of a  
lower back injury.? Coach Al Groh is being his usual guarded self with the  
""if he plays he plays"" type comments.? We'll know more here soon and will  
shoot it to you.? 
?

Scott Mitchell  Improving??? CBS Sportsline is reporting Scott  Mitchell's 
sprained knee is improving.?? He's listed as doubtful but  is reportedly 
making good progress.? With visions of Akili Smith in their  heads, I'm sure 
he's getting lots of encouragement.? Seems weird to be  getting excited about 
Scott Mitchell but the truth is he looked pretty good  Sunday.? His play was 
great news for Peter Warrick fans.? He makes  Corey Dillon better too.
?
?
Jeff George to Start??  Coach Norv Turner said today that unless Brad 
Johnson's knee is 100% healthy,  Jeff George would start.? Most reports are 
that Johnson's knee is not 100%  yet.? One more great game from George and 
this will be very  interesting.
?
?
Donald Hayes 50/50??  KFFL.com is reporting George Seifert said that WR 
Donald Hayes is questionable  for this week's game with a bad groin.?RB 
Tshimanga Biakabutuka is still  hobbled with a bad foot so the Panthers can 
ill afford to lose Hayes  too.
?
?
James Stewart Hopeful??  KFFL.com is reporting: ""James Stewart (hip pointer) 
and Mario Bates (knee) were  wearing red jerseys during Monday's practice. 
Red jerseys mean the players  aren't allowed to be hit. Lions head coach Gary 
Moeller stated he thinks Stewart  will be able to play Thursday against the 
Patriots. 
?
?
?
These are just a few quick ones for you.?  We'll have our full blown Players 
in the News Wednesday night.? See you  then.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  ""We'll see Wednesday or Thursday,"" said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, ""but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play.""    

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.     

 Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 The status of the Jets' running back for this week's game against the Bears 
is still uncertain.  Martin left Sunday's game in Miami with what was 
described as a strained back, and never returned to the field.  He had an 
examination by team doctors yesterday, and had some X-rays taken as well.  
The club hasn't released any information on the resluts of the exam.  If 
Martin is on your Fantasy squad, your best bet is to stay tuned as the week 
progresses.     

 Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 According to New York Newsday , Coles will be unable to play in this week's 
game against the Bears.  He was hit on the knee during the opening kickoff of 
the second half in Sunday's win over the Dolphins.  If Coles is an integral 
part of your roster, look to pick up Dedric Ward, who should get more playing 
time in Coles' absence.    

 Billy Joe Tolliver , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints re-signed Tolliver yesterday, after the 10-year veteran had been 
cut by the team during training camp. With Jeff Blake out for the season, New 
Orleans needed a No. 3 quarterback, so Tolliver will fill that role behind 
starter Aaron Brooks and backup Jake Delhomme.  

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints placed Blake on injured reserve yesterday, officially ending his 
season. He will have surgery on his fractured and dislocated right foot as 
soon as the swelling subsides and the extent of the damage is determined. 
Blake will be replaced by Aaron Brooks.  

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith's status is still not certain, but he does expect to return for 
Sunday's game against the Colts.  He left last week's game against the Jets 
after aggravating his strained right hamstring, an injury which he sustained 
a week earlier against the Chargers.  Smith has been one of the year's 
biggest Fantasy sleepers, and has become an everyday starter for those 
Fantasy owners who were lucky enough to grab him.  If he does in fact play 
this week, be sure to include him in your starting lineup.    

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Although his status is still up in the air, Fiedler expects that he will be 
ready to play in Sunday's AFC showdown against the Colts.  Fiedler was 
injured on the first play of the Jets' game when linebacker Mo Lewis drove 
his head and shoulder into the turf. He suffered a slightly seperated 
throwing shoulder and developed muscle spasms in his back.  Fielder isn't one 
of the better options in the Fantasy game, so avoid playing him this week 
even if he does start.  

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/21/00 
 The Redskins should know by Thursday if Johnson can re-assume his starting 
job for this week's showdown against the Eagles.  He has started to test his 
injured left knee with some light dropbacks and will likely push the knee 
harder during practice on Wednesday and Thursday.    

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With the injury to Ike Hilliard, Jurevicius will likely start this week's 
game at Arizona.  With only 12 receptions on the entire season, Jurevicius 
isn't a solid Fantasy option, so don't pick him up unless your roster is 
really straped for receivers.    

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Antoine Winfield has been lost for the rest of the season with a 
torn labrum in his right shoulder.  He suffered the injury three weeks ago 
against New England. Winfield has tried to play through the pain, but has 
aggravated the injury in each of Buffalo's last two games.  Head Coach Wade 
Phillips announced to the media that Winfield will have surgery on 
Wednesday.  His loss will hurt Buffalo's secondary, but they remain a solid 
defense in the world of Fantasy.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Huard the starter for this week's game 
against the Broncos.  Huard took all of the snaps with the first team offense 
after a bye week, and is ready to make his first start since sustaining a 
concussion on Oct. 22 in Oakland.  Huard isn't considered a solid Fantasy 
option, so don't start him until he shows some signs that he is ready to 
produce.    

 Cardinals , DT ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Arizona defense came out of Sunday's loss to the Eagles extremely banged 
up.  Linebacker Zach Walz, who just recently returned from knee surgery, is 
out with a broken left leg.  Defensive tackle Mark Smith hurt his shoulder 
and had his arm in a sling on Monday.  Safety Kwamie Lassiter was also 
injured in the game, suffering a sprained knee. With all of these injuries on 
defense, it's probably a good idea to keep the Cardinals' defense on the 
bench this week.      

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/20/00 
 Alstott probably will miss the rest of the regular season after spraining 
his left knee in Tampa Bay's 13-10 loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday.  The 
Bucs described Alstott's injury as a third-degree sprain of the medial 
collateral ligament and said he is expected to be sidelined six to eight 
weeks.  Charles Kirby, a third-year pro in his first season with Tampa Bay, 
will replace Alstott.     

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Meximullets Updated 11/20/00 
 Toomer posted a great day for his Fantasy owners against Detroit, catching 
eight passes for 108 yards in the Giants' 31-21 loss. He may have a more 
difficult time next week against Arizona's All-Pro cornerback Aeneas 
Williams, so start him at your own discretion.      

 Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Barber caught eight passes and compiled 129 yards of total offense in 
Sunday's loss to the Lions.  Look for Barber to get a number of looks out of 
the backfield this week against Arizona, as the Giants attempt to compensate 
for the loss of wide receiver Ike Hilliard.   

 Kerry Collins , QB NYG - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Collins threw a season-high 51 passes on Sunday, but it wasn't enough to 
tame the Lions.  Collins has been a more productive Fantasy option of late, 
throwing eight touchdown passes in his last three games. He may run into a 
road block this week against the Cardinals, however, especially if Ike 
Hilliard is unable to play.  Without Hilliard, Arizona can put All-Pro 
cornerback Aeneas Williams on Amani Toomer, leaving Tiki Barber and Pete 
Mitchell as Collins' only real receiving options. If you can find a better 
quarterback than Collins this week, it might be a good idea to use 
him.           

 James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 11/20/00 
 McKnight caught four passes for 50 yards in Sunday's loss at Baltimore.  He 
could, however, be a good sleeper pick this week against the Vikings.  
Minnesota's secondary can be beaten downfield, so look for McKnight to try 
and break a few long ones in an effort to spark a banged up Dallas offense.   
 

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Ramiro Updated 11/20/00 
 Smith had his second consecutive subpar performance on Sunday against the 
Ravens, rushing for only 48 yards on eleven carries. He has been held to only 
64 yards rushing in the past two weeks, which is significant when you 
consider that Smith is one of the league's greatest running backs of 
all-time.  The combination of a short week and the loss of center Mark 
Stepnoski will hurt Smith's production, so it might be a good idea to sit him 
this week if your roster allows it.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Aikman found out just how good the Ravens' defense is on Sunday.  He 
completed just 19-of-33 passes for 138 yards and three interceptions in 
Dallas' 27-0 loss in Baltimore. Aikman faces a Minnesota defense on 
Thanksgiving that has been solid in recent weeks, so don't expect any kind of 
Fantasy explosion from the Cowboys' aging quarterback.      

 Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/20/00 
 Hilliard, who left Sunday's game against the Lions with a bruised sternum 
and lung, will remain in the hospital for the next two days and will likely 
miss this Sunday's game against Arizona. Look for Joe Jurevicius to start in 
Hilliard's place, but don't expect him to produce the same type of numbers 
that Hilliard has posted.     

 Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/00 
 Anderson ran 17 times for 76 yards against the 49ers Sunday.  Although he 
has become more confident in putting weight on his bad knee, you probably 
won't see Anderson have a big game until next season.  Don't expect things to 
get any better for Anderson next week when he goes up against a tough Raiders 
run defense.     

 Johnnie Morton , WR DET - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/00 
 Morton awakened from his slumber to catch six passes for  78 yards against 
the Giants Sunday.  He only had one catch in each of the Lions last three 
games.  Morton will probably struggle once again this Thursday when the Lions 
face a formidable Patriots secondary.     

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 11/20/00 
 While completing 23-of-36 passes, Favre threw for 301  yards with two 
touchdowns and one interception.  He showed extreme toughness Sunday, 
starting the game despite suffering a sprained foot a week earlier.  He 
should be just as effective next week against a docile Panthers pass rush.  
Carolina won't put too much pressure on Favre, allowing him to dissect the 
secondary, and pile up Fantasy points.     

 Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Meximullets Updated 11/20/00 
 The Packers' wideout had what might have been his best game of the season 
against the Colts Sunday, racking up 155 yards on eight catches.  He won't 
continue to post numbers like this, but look for Schroeder to have some 
success against the Panthers this Sunday.     

 Ahman Green , RB GB - Ramiro Updated 11/20/00 
 Green ran for a career-high 153 yards on 24 carries Sunday against the 
Colts.  His success should continue in upcomings games against the weak run 
defenses of the Panthers, Bears, and Lions.   

 Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 In relief of Blake, the little-used Brooks completed 14-of-22 passes for 187 
yards, with two touchdowns and one  interception.  Owners of Jeff Blake may 
want to consider picking up Brooks.  It will take some time for Brooks to get 
used to playing in the NFL, but he could put up solid numbers in the final 
games of the season as the Saints face a plethora of weak pass defenses.

Dear Concerned American:

The major media are not telling the truth about this
election and the serious vote fraud that has taken place.

Al Gore is trying to steal this election and the liberal
media are helping them.

NewsMax.com has set up an Emergency Fund to take out ads
across America to directly inform the American people about
this election and Al Gore's attempt to overturn the election
results.

It's critically important we bypass the major liberal media.

Already NewsMax has taken ads out in major newspapers like
USA Today. We plan on more ads on the web, in major papers,
and even ads on TV and radio.

If you want to help or just want more information, please
read NewsMax.com's Urgent Letter.

This is important. Al Gore is planning to take this to the
Electoral College. We need to act now.

Thank you.

game is just good  enough to be a real worry for the defense but not so=20
dominant that it hurts the  QB.

QB Mark Brunell (Jac)? It's  really weird.? When the hype finally subsides=
=20
about this guy, he starts  delivering Fantasy numbers worthy of hype.? Go=
=20
figure.?=20

QB Kurt Warner (StL)? This may  have been the greatest QB performance in th=
e=20
history of the league without  scoring a TD.? The guy was incredible=20
completing 84% of his passes (27 of  32)? Completing 84% with an average pa=
ss=20
of 12.8 yards is sick.? The  TDs will come as Warner looked as good as I've=
=20
ever seen him placing the ball  perfectly and directing his offense.

QB Ray Lucas (NYJ)? Keep an eye  on Vinnie's groin.? Better yet, watch the=
=20
injury reports for news on  Vinnie's groin.? That's better.? We should know=
=20
more soon but if it's  serious, Lucas will get the start.

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Marshall Faulk (StL)? I know  you don't need me to list him here but it'=
s=20
worth noting I think he may be the  best player in the league right now.?=
=20
Martz fed him the ball 25 times and  he delivered.

RB Eddie George (Ten)? George  showed outstanding pass receiving skills and=
=20
added 2 receiving TDs to go with  his rushing TD.? He reinjured his sore to=
e=20
but looks to be ok.? Keep  an eye on it though.

RB Fred Taylor (Jac)? What a  shocker.? Taylor runs wild again as we=20
predicted.? He did tweak a knee  so watch that but if he can go full speed,=
=20
he's a no brainer starter against  just about anyone.

RB James Allen (Chi)? If  departed Offensive Coordinator Gary Crowton was=
=20
dead (don't get excited Bears  fans, he's not), he'd be spinning in his gra=
ve=20
to see Allen garner 37 carries  Sunday.? Be a little leery though as a 2.6=
=20
ypc carry average only works  when you carry the ball a ton.?=20

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)? After  fading badly, Prentice comes roaring back=
=20
with a 2 TD performance.? He only  had 46 yards on 17 attempts but the TDs=
=20
are huge.? The Brown offense  featured some crazy looks with Kevin Johnson=
=20
occasionally at QB but they looked  much better.

RB Mike Anderson (Den)? What  else can you say?? The Denver OL is having=20
another Pro Bowl season.?  Anderson is a must start vs any team right now.

RB Ahman Green (GB)? I'm very  nervous if I'm Dorsey Levens right now.?=20
Green's been an offensive stalwart  carrying the load week after week.?=20
Everyone always knew he had the  potential to be this good but now he's=20
delivering.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal)? As was  mentioned on the broadcast yesterday, ""Someo=
ne=20
forgot to tell the Redskins this  game is a rivalry""? You know the Cowboys=
=20
and Emmitt in particular had to  enjoy humiliating the Redskins.? It would =
be=20
a bold move even for him but I  wouldn't be surprised in the least to see=
=20
Danny Snyder fire Terry Robiskie  before his obligatory three games are up.=
?=20

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? Once  again, Lewis rolls over the opponents and makes=
=20
me look bad for dissing him this  Summer...? Against the Cardinals this wee=
k,=20
he has the chance to be even  better.

RB Warrick Dunn (TB)? If Dunn  had any help, the Bucs would scary.? Right=
=20
now, he's doing it all by  himself.? Which probably isn't a bad thing for=
=20
Dunn owners.

RB Tony Richardson (KC)?  Richardson netted 5.2 ypc on 17 carries.? Donnell=
=20
Bennett looks to have  cartilage damage to his knee so Richardson's workloa=
d=20
should increase.?  It's a shame someone has to get hurt for Gunther=20
Cunningham to give Richardson  more looks.

RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car)?  Don't hold your breath but Biakabutuka is=
=20
making noises about returning to the  lineup this week.? We'll see...

RB Terry Allen (NO)? In a  lesser version of Denver's OL, it appears most=
=20
anyone can run effectively behind  these guys.? Allen looked rejuvenated=20
Sunday and should only get better as  he gets familiar with the system.

RB Chris Warren (Phi)? Remember  that he's off this week but if your league=
=20
runs through week 17, he could be a  factor.?=20

?

WRs Moving Up

WR Sean Dawkins (Sea)??  Dawkins is quietly posting some very strong=20
numbers.? As is Jon  Kitna.? Dawkins is drawing a lot of looks and could=20
continue his  roll.

WR Torrance Small / Charles Johnson  (Phi)? Look what QB Donovan McNabb can=
=20
do when his WRs decide to  show up.? If they can continue to play well, thi=
s=20
team could be  scary.? Remember they're off this week but return in week 17=
.

WR Amani Toomer (NYG)? Of the resurging Giants,  Toomer's leading the=20
charge.? He's making plays all over the field and even  had a nice run agai=
n.

WR Terrell Owens (SF)? The  scary part is he could have been even better th=
an=20
the 129 yard / 1 TD  performance Sunday.? He looked very good coming back=
=20
from the toe injury  and should only get better.? The 49ers are trying to=
=20
nail down their WR  corps for 2001 and Owens is making a statement.

WR Ed McCaffrey (Den)? It's  easy to get excited whenever he outplays Rod=
=20
Smith but the truth of the matter  is that they're both excellent WRs.? I=
=20
love McCaffrey and his 6th grade  shoulder pads.? He's the anti-Eric=20
Dickerson when it comes to pads (or lack  thereof)? Easy Ed goes with prett=
y=20
much the Helmet and Pee Wee Shoulder  pads and that's it.? Oh yeah, he's al=
so=20
a great WR...

WR Darrell Jackson (Sea)?  Jackson made the Upgrade List last week and=20
delivered.? I see few reasons  why he won't continue to shine.

WR Torry Holt (StL)? It's tough  to predict which Ram WR will catch the=20
passes from Warner but as I said several  weeks ago, Holt may be the best W=
R=20
on the team.? And that's no sleight to  Isaac Bruce - Holt's that good.?=20

WR Terry Glenn (NE)??  Glenn's putting together one of his most complete=20
seasons.? And Bledsoe's  continuing to play pretty good football which help=
s.

WR Willie Jackson (NO)? 1  catch.? 1 TD.? You gotta like a guy who gets rig=
ht=20
to the point.?  Joe Horn is the clear #1 threat but Jackson is a serious=20
option too.

WR Germane Crowell (Det)? This  didn't look like a guy returning from a=20
broken leg.? He should continue to  get better as he becomes more involved =
in=20
the flow of things.=20

WR Bobby Shaw (Pit)? It seems  hard to believe, but Bobby Shaw is a=20
legitimate starter in many leagues.?  He's getting lots of looks and the=20
Steeler are throwing the ball.=20

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)? Hilliard  looked well rested as he roared back onto=
=20
the scene.? An sprained knee  suffered by Joe Jurevicius will likely increa=
se=20
Hilliard's playing time even  further.

WR Donald Hayes (Car)? Hayes  looked better as expected and turned in a nic=
e=20
game catching 5 passes for 77  yards.? The Panthers need to remain focused=
=20
but if they can, Hayes could  contribute.

?

TEs Moving Up

TE Johnny McWilliams (Min)?  McWilliams again was active catching 5 passes=
=20
for 53 yards.? I like any  receiver on this team.

TE Andrew Glover (NO)? Glover's  starting to become a very integral part of=
=20
the New Orleans passing game.?  It's hard to imagine this team losing=20
Ricky?Williams, Jeff Blake and Cam  Cleeland.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)? He's no  Wesley Walls but he's more than adequate.

TE Greg Clark (SF)? He only had  24 yards but the 4 receptions were a nice=
=20
bonus.?=20

?

QBs Moving  Down

QB Scott  Mitchell (Cin)? The clock struck midnight as Mitchell became the =
=20
guy we remembered.? This team is pretty much Corey Dillon and a roll of the=
 =20
dice with Peter Warrick for his big play potential.

QB Jeff  George (Was)? I've gotta say I'm really surprised George didn't =
=20
post some great numbers.? Albert Connell isn't nearly as good as he thinks =
=20
he is and that may be part of the problem.

QB Steve  Beuerlein (Car)? It's clear to everyone that 1999 was a career =
=20
year.? He's still subject to a great game here and there but he's just too =
=20
streaky to lean very heavily on.

QB Shaun  King (TB)? This guy just isn't very good.

QB Charlie  Batch (Det)? I've never been a big Charlie Batch fan although=
=20
he's  certainly had his days.? He looked a bit lost at times Sunday and=20
possibly  losing Herman Moore won't help.? (Although German Crowell is back=
)

QB Troy  Aikman (Dal)? I hope Aikman does himself a favor and gives Steve =
=20
Young a call.? A sore back is one thing.? Not remembering your kid's  names=
=20
is an entirely different matter. It's not worth it, Guy.

QB Ryan  Leaf (SD)? Part of it was Baltimore.? A large part of it was  Leaf=
.

QB Jay  Fiedler (Mia)? Fiedler suffered a torn rotator cuff on his non =20
throwing shoulder.? The Dolphins will make a decision Wednesday likely =20
whether it'll be Fiedler or Huard this week at QB.

QB Vinnie  Testeverde (NYJ)? Vinnie suffered a groin injury that may or may=
 =20
not be serious.? He's not getting any younger though so keep an eye on this=
 =20
one.

?

RBs Moving  Down

RB Ron  Dayne (NYG)? It's just hard to get excited about starting this guy =
=20
as he's such a risk to be taken out of the gameplan.? He's always liable to=
 =20
grab that short yardage TD but you just don't know when or where they'll =
=20
happen.

RB Jerald  Moore (FA)? Things change quickly in this league.? A few  weeks=
=20
ago, Moore looked to be the #1 RB.? Now he's unemployed.

RB Darnell  Autry (Phi)?? I'd expect that Chris Warren will cut into his =
=20
time when they return.

RB Jamel  White (Cle)? Travis Prentice carried the load while White watched=
 =20
this week.

RB Brad  Hoover (Car)? He came back to reality this week.? On top of  that,=
=20
it looks like his days may be numbered as Tshimanga Biakabutuka looks to  t=
ry=20
and return this week.

?

WRs Moving  Down=20

WR Herman  Moore (Det)?? Moore suffered?a neck stinger  Sunday.? He could=
=20
likely give way to Germane Crowell who looked very good  returning from his=
=20
injury.

WR Tai  Streets (SF)? Conventional wisdom had Streets seeing more action  a=
s=20
the 49ers tried to see what they had for 2001 but with the return of Terrel=
l =20
Owens, it looks like Streets will be limited.

WR  Courtney Hawkins (Pit)? He's losing time to Bobby Shaw.? The  Steeler W=
Rs=20
seem to be pretty well set with Hines Ward and Shaw.

WR Danny  Farmer (Cin)? Farmer had made a little noise pushing for a spot =
=20
alongside Peter Warrick but it doesn't look like it's going to make any =20
difference.

WR J.J.  Stokes (SF)? Like Tai Streets, Stokes suffers from the return of =
=20
Terrell Owens.?=20

WR  Sylvester Morris (KC)? Morris continues his regression which  should se=
nd=20
red flags as owners look towards 2001.

WR  Keyshawn Johnson (TB)? With Shaun King struggling, I don't see a  brigh=
t=20
future for Keyshawn ahead.? He sounds like a politician conceding  when he=
=20
speaks of the team finding it's identity in running the ball.?=20

?

TEs Moving  Down

TE Anthony  Becht (NYJ)? In the up and down season from Anthony Becht, it =
=20
looks like he's headed down a bit.? The injury to Testeverde affects his =
=20
stock in a negative way.

TE Tony  McGee (Cin)? Not that McGee was carrying many FF teams but he =20
suffered a broken ankle.

TE Jeff  Thomason (Phi)? Looks like Chad Lewis has resumed his role as the =
=20
primary TE.?=20

TE David  LaFluer (Dal)? Between injuries to himself and QB Troy Aikman, =
=20
LaFluer was limited and it looks like it may not be changing anytime soon.

Freeze it and use to keep perishable food cold. Put  in a zip lock bag to

 Latest NBA Player News 

 Rex Chapman , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Chapman announced his retirement Monday because of a series of injuries.  He 
underwent surgery on his right wrist before training camp and began the 
season on the injured list.  Chapman is also scheduled to have ankle surgery 
soon.     

 Todd Day , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Day was activated from the injured list Friday.  Guard Sam Jacobsen was 
placed on the list to make room for Day.  Day was a key reserve for the Suns 
in 1999-2000 but was sidelined for the first few weeks this season due to a 
knee injury.  He will be a valuable reserve for the T'Wolves as well but 
won't help a Fantasy team too much.     

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Skinner was placed on the injured list after hurting his ankle.  Zendon 
Hamilton was activated to replace Skinner on the roster.  Skinner has been 
somewhat of a disappointment this season averaging 5.8 points and 4.7 
rebounds per game.     

 Jeff McInnis , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 McInnis is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nets after 
suffering a bruised knee against the Sonics Saturday.  Rookie Keyon Dooling 
is expected to get his first start at point guard for the Clippers.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Williams played 26 minutes in Saturday's game against the Suns, scoring four 
points and grabbing seven rebounds.  He had missed Thursday's game against 
the Hornets because of a hip and groin injuries.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Del Negro played eight minutes in Sunday's loss to the Knicks.  He had 
missed the Warriors previous two games due to a sprained ankle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Buckner re-injured his right foot and is expected to be sidelined for at 
least a week.  Hubert Davis is expected to start at shooting guard in his 
absence.    

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Dickerson is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nuggets due 
to a sprained ankle.  Look for veteran Kevin Edwards to start at shooting 
guard in his place.    

 Doug West , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 West's strained right shoulder has healed and head coach Sidney Lowe is 
expected to activate him from the injured list this week.  Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 
is expected to be placed on the injured list to make room for West.  

 Shareef Abdur-Rahim , F VAN - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/20/00 
 Abdur-Rahim is expected to play in Monday's game against Vancouver.  He 
missed Saturday's game to be with his sick mother in Atlanta.  If he doesn't 
make it back to Vancouver in time rookie Stromile Swift could get a rare 
start at small forward.    

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 MacCulloch was placed on the injured list Monday with an ankle injury.  With 
the return of Matt Geiger, MacCulloch's already low Fantasy value diminishes 
even further.     

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/20/00 
 Geiger has been activated off the injured list, and could see some playing 
time in tonight's game in Boston.  With Geiger's return, the Sixers placed 
center Todd McCulloch on the injured list.  If you have Geiger on your 
Fantasy roster, give him some time to get back into game shape before putting 
him in your starting lineup.    

 Tim Thomas , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Thomas disclosed on Saturday that he is having some real discomfort in his 
left knee, and it is getting worse with each game that he plays. Thomas has 
started off slow, but didn't want to use the injury as an excuse.  ""It's very 
painful at times,"" said Thomas. ""The only thing I can do is keep getting rest 
as much as possible.""  The Bucks can ill-afford to lose Thomas; they have 
already lost starting forward Darvin Ham and backup forward Scott Williams 
this season.  If Thomas is on your Fantasy squad, it might be a good idea to 
keep in on the bench until his condition improves.      

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Jones has missed three straight games with a right calf sprain, but says 
that he expects to play on Wednesday night against Cleveland. Jones has 
averaged 16.9 points through his first seven games in Miami.     

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/20/00 
 Rose his hoping to make his season debut on Tuesday night against the 
Rockets, but he's not making any promises.  He was suppose to return to 
action last week, but the team's medical personnel advised him to wait a bit 
longer before hitting the court.  If Rose is on your roster, give him at 
least another week before putting him into your starting lineup.    

 Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 The Detroit Pistons announced on Monday morning that they had come to terms 
with Smith, on what is believed to be a one-year deal for the NBA's mid-level 
exception of $2.25 million (pro-rated after 11 games).  Smith had reportedly  
agreed to re-sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum 
of $611,000 last week.  He will eventually be the Pistons starting center but 
will probably spend the next few weeks inmproving his conditioning.  There is 
no need to rush and try to acquire Smith.  He has been a solid reserve 
at-best throughout his career.  If you have him on your Fantasy team wait 
awhile before you insert him into your lineup.     

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/20/00 
 Camby turned his ankle during Friday night's victory in Phoenix. X-rays 
taken on his ankle were negative, then Camby underwent an MRI as a 
precautionary measure. He missed Sunday night's game against the Warriors, 
and is listed as day to day.       

 Tim Hardaway , G MIA - The Old School Fools Updated 11/19/00 
 Hardaway, plagued by knee ailments for the past two seasons, sat out 
Saturday night's game against the Portland Trail Blazers with tendinitis in 
his right knee. Hardaway said he expects to play in Miami's next game 
Wednesday against Cleveland.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00 
 O'Neal, bothered by a sprained left ankle and a sore Achilles' tendon, was 
not in uniform Saturday night as the Los Angeles Lakers played the Denver 
Nuggets.  His status is day-to-day.  O'Neal said he was injured when someone 
fell on his leg in the first quarter of Thursday night's overtime victory at 
Sacramento. Greg Foster took O'Neal's place in the starting lineup.     

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00 
 Coleman, who missed the entire preseason because of an irregular heartbeat, 
was placed on the injured list Saturday so he can improve his conditioning.   
The move comes after Charlotte Hornets coach Paul Silas complained about the 
power forward's weight   

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Nesby made his fifth consecutive start at shooting guard for the Clippers 
Thursday.  Although he did not score in the game his defense against 
Vancouver's Michael Dickerson might have solidified him at the two-spot.  The 
switch has worked lately as the Clippers have won two games in a row.  Keep 
an eye on Nesby, if he starts scoring some points he will be a solid Fantasy 
pickup.      

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/17/00 
 McDyess appears to have overcome the back injury that stunted his production 
last week.  He scored 16 points and grabbed 11 rebounds against the Bulls 
Thursday.  McDyess is averaging 22 points and 10.6 boards in his last three 
games.  It is now safe to start McDyess again if you benched him last week.   
 

 Ruben Patterson , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Suffering from the flu, Patterson is questionable for Friday's game against 
the Mavericks.  Patterson recently rejoined the Sonics' starting lineup at 
shooting guard.  If he is unable to play Brent Barry will probably start.    

 Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 The Dallas Morning News reports that Smith has agreed to re-sign with the 
Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum of $611,000.  The deal, 
subject to league approval, could be formally announced later Friday or 
Saturday.  Smith's return to Minnesota will land him in his familiar role as 
a backup at the power forward and center positions.  His situation has 
created a lot of buzz but the truth is he is not much of a Fantasy player 
anyway.  If you already have a solid frontcourt don't try to pursue him.  If 
your Fantasy frontcourt is lacking then try to get him.  He will be a good 
addition to a Fantasy team but won't be a star.     

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Once one of the Spurs best outside shooters, Jackson has played in only one 
game this season, due in part to a lingering ankle injury.  At this point it 
would be wise to get rid of Jackson if you have him on your team and add 
another guard/forward.    

 Chris Webber , F SAC - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/17/00 
 Webber sat out Thursday's game against the Lakers due to a sprained ankle.  
Scott Pollard started at power forward in Webber's place.  Webber is listed 
as day-to-day and is expected to return for the Kings' next game on 
Wednesday.    

 Terrell Brandon , G MIN - Fear Updated 11/17/00 
 Brandon will miss his third straight game Friday when he sits out the 
T'Wolves home game against the Spurs.  Chauncey Billups will continue to 
start in his absence.  It may not be a bad idea to bench Brandon and add 
Billups to your team until he is back to full strength.     

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Williams missed Thursday's game against the Hornets due to a left groin and 
hip strain.  He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.  Shandon Anderson 
moved over to small forward in his absence and Cuttino Mobley moved into the 
starting lineup at shooting guard.  Williams remains one of the premier 
three-point shooters in the NBA connecting on 50 percent of his attempts this 
season.       

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Mills has missed Golden State's last two games because of a sore back.  He 
is questionable for Friday's game at Indiana.  When he does return he may be 
inserted into the starting lineup at small forward. Starting power forward 
Danny Fortson will be sidelined for the next few weeks due to a sore right 
foot.  Mills and Chris Mullin will be called upon to fill the void in the 
frontcourt.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Del Negro missed Wednesday's game due to an ankle injury and is doubtful for 
Friday's contest at Indiana.  Newly-acquired Randy Livingston will be the 
backup point guard in his absence.

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=

down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

?

QBs Moving Up

QB Gus Frerotte (Den)? You have  to love Frerotte stepping in and performin=
g=20
like he did.? Of course, when  you throw the ball 58 times, good things oft=
en=20
happen.? When you throw the  ball 58 times with a 62% completion percentage=
,=20
great things happen.? Look  for more of the same.

QB Kerry Collins (NYG)? The  Giants may be struggling but Collins continues=
=20
to put up excellent Fantasy  Football numbers.? With guys like Kurt Warner=
=20
and Daunte Culpepper, it's  easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs=
=20
come from great teams.? Not  always the case as Collins is showing.? Often=
=20
times, it's teams with  vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco=
=20
that provides the QB  motivation to play catch-up.? Collins looks comfortab=
le=20
in the pocket and  if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike=20
Hilliard healthy for four  quarters, who knows what might happen.

QB Brett Favre (GB)? He's  baaaaack.? I said last week that Favre coming ba=
ck=20
on the bad foot would be  storybook material for a storybook kind of guy an=
d=20
Favre delivered.? 2 TDs  and 301 yards have the Packers riding high and=20
believing they can?make some  noise.? WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an=20
excellent #2 WR and RB Ahman Green  is filling the void left by Dorsey=20
Levens.?=20

QB Aaron Brooks (NO)? I may be  in the minority (imagine that...) but I was=
=20
very impressed with Brooks taking  over for Jeff Blake.? He was not a #2 QB=
=20
like Jim Miller in Chicago that  knew he'd be inserted any minute.? Brooks=
=20
was thrust into the game and  responded very nicely.? He's skinny at #205 b=
ut=20
tall (6' 4"")? Big  league arm and nice mobility.? Of particular note was hi=
s=20
tendency to throw  to WR Willie Jackson.? We'll see if that continues.? Sur=
e,=20
he's a long  shot but if you're desperate for a QB, he could be a nice =20
surprise.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD)? Hold the  presses, Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade=
=20
list.? Seriously, he's an  easy target and I'll admit to taking my share of=
=20
shots but you can't deny the  guy has skills.? Yes, there were some fluky=
=20
plays with Crockett injuring  himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw=
.?=20
(although the 3 TDs on 13  completions did make for a wild looking box scor=
e=20
for Leaf)? He's got some  weapons in Jeff Graham, Curtis Conway and his bes=
t=20
receiver, TE Freddie  Jones.? He's as flaky as they come but he might be=20
worth a look if you're  dying at QB.

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Fred Taylor (Jac)? Taylor  put together one of the best performances of=
=20
the year Sunday night.? The  fact that he did it against the very tough rus=
h=20
defense of the Steelers makes it  even all the more impressive.? This isn't=
=20
like rolling up 200 yards on the  Cowboys or Cardinals.? Clearly, there's=
=20
reason for huge hope as if he can  do this against Pittsburgh, he can do it=
=20
against anyone.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? Once  again, Lewis ran hard.? He's got to be consider=
ed=20
one of the better RBs in  the game right now.? I still worry about how=20
durable he'll be but he's  looked great lately averaging 6.7 yards per carr=
y=20
Sunday for 187 yards.? If  it weren't for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturin=
g=20
a TD here and there, he'd be  even higher.

RB Darnell Autry (Phi)? Autry  refuses to hand over the #1 RB job to Stanle=
y=20
Pritchett or anyone else.?  He's not very flashy but he gets the job done=
=20
both rushing and receiving.?  The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in=
=20
the standings and Autry figures to  be a large part of that success.

RB Ahman Green (GB)? I'd be a  little worried right now if I were Dorsey=20
Levens.? Green averaged 6.4 yards  per carry Sunday as he rolled up 180 tot=
al=20
yards.? Most importantly, was  his number of fumbles: Zero.? No one's ever=
=20
doubted his incredible physical  skills, but now he seems to be bringing th=
e=20
mental game to go with  it.

RB Mike Anderson (Den)? I hate  to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a grea=
t=20
impression of Isaac Bruce's  maddening 1998 on again, off again season.? As=
=20
you know, Davis missed  another game and once again, Anderson stepped in=20
nicely.?? By now, you  know it's tough to predict what Davis is going to do=
=20
each week so it looks to me  as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup.

RB Jamal Anderson (Atl)?  Anderson's 4.5 yards per carry reminded many of h=
is=20
1998 season.? He's  running with power and speed and finally appears to be=
=20
over the knee  injury.? I think he's been over it physically for a while no=
w=20
but it seems  he's handling the mental aspect too.

?

WRs Moving Up

WR Willie Jackson (NO)? New QB  Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being=20
thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson  responded well with 4 catches and=
=20
85 yards including 2 TDs.? Often times,  you'll see a backup QB favor the=
=20
backup WRs as they're familiar with them.?  We'll see if this continues.? I=
'm=20
guessing Brooks will get comfortable  throwing to Joe Horn this week but=20
Jackson is still definitely worth a  shot.

WR Joe Jurevicius (NYG)? As I  mentioned above, QB Kerry Collins is playing=
=20
very well. With Ike Hilliard set to  miss some time, Jurevicius should get =
a=20
chance to show what he can do.?  He's long been a Fantasy Football tease=20
showing flashes but never really having  the opportunity for playing time.?=
=20
Let's see what he can  do.

WR Terry Glenn (NE)? I've  been?high on Glenn since June.? He made me look=
=20
good early on but had  cooled midseason.? He's now back warming up again an=
d=20
for you Glenn owners,  your patience is paying off.? QB Drew Bledsoe didn't=
=20
have a TD, but he did  roll up the yards.? Once again, Glenn was the prime =
=20
target.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)? Smith  looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as=
=20
the Jags awakened their  offense?Sunday night.? Smith seems back in synch=
=20
with QB Mark Brunell  and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game.=
?=20
There may not be  enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enoug=
h=20
for  Smith.

WR James McNight (Dal)? Yes,  he's a long shot considering the horrid play =
of=20
Troy Aikman Sunday but you have  to like a WR who's getting a ton of looks.=
?=20
And McNight's getting those  looks from Aikman.? Can't make plays without t=
he=20
ball...

?

TEs Moving Up

TE Jay Reimersma (Buf)? We've  been waiting for Reimersma to return to form=
=20
and he looks to be on his  way.? He was heavily involved and seemed=20
comfortable with ""new"" QB Rob  Johnson.? He can be a vital part of the=20
offense and you have to think  Johnson will continue to utilize him.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)? Mangum's  no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a=
=20
nice target.? 4 catches for 47  yards is an improvement from what they've h=
ad=20
at TE and it looks like he's back  and healthy now.

?

Players Moving  Down

?

QBs Moving Down

QB Steve Beuerlein (Car)?  There's only so much a QB can do by himself.? He=
=20
lost Wesley Walls a couple  of weeks ago. I thought Beuerlein could handle=
=20
losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but  losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injur=
y=20
proved too much.? His OL is less  than stellar and he's just not having muc=
h=20
time to throw.? =20

QB Shaun King (TB)? King swings  back toward the side of mediocrity after a=
=20
91 yard passing effort against  Chicago.? It looked that bad too.? Even for=
 a=20
Les Steckel  Offense.? Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a=
=20
positive as  teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson.

QB Steve McNair (Ten)? Not all  the turnovers Sunday were McNair's fault bu=
t=20
he certainly had a hand in  them.? His problem remains a lack of healthy WR=
s=20
and a stellar RB in Eddie  George who can carry the load.? Last year, it wa=
s=20
McNair vulturing TDs from  George but it doesn't seem to be a problem this=
=20
year.?=20

QB Jake Plummer (Ari)? If  you're a regular reader, you know I'm not a=20
Plummer fan.? I'm especially  not a fan now that he's hurt as well.? He may=
=20
get back soon but it won't  matter for this team that's in shambles=20
offensively.

?

RBs Moving Down

RB Thomas Jones (Ari)? Jones'  was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but=20
still, you like to see a better yards  per carry average than negative 2...

RB Kevin Faulk (NE)? Either  Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is=
=20
not a very good football  player.? How else do you explain Faulk earning on=
e=20
carry while his RB  partner J.R. Redmond was inactive?? Patrick Pass got th=
e=20
bulk of the work  but was ineffective.? I'm guessing, it's the fumbling tha=
t=20
earned his spot  in the doghouse.?=20

RB Ron Dayne (NYG)? As we've  said so often in the past, Ron Dayne's=20
productivity is tied directly to how well  the Giants are playing.? If New=
=20
York is leading, you'll see Dayne.? If  they're trailing, it's the Tiki=20
Barber show.? Lately, it's been more Tiki  than Dayne.? And if the Giants=
=20
don't make some improvements on defense, I  don't see that changing.

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)?  Prentice got folks excited early in the year but=
=20
he's been disappointing of  late.? Prentice is losing carries to Jamel Whit=
e=20
and that doesn't look to  change anytime soon.?=20

?

WRs Moving Down

WR Marcus Robinson (Chi)?  Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it=
=20
appears the QB rotation is  affecting his play.? With Shane Matthews=20
starting, Robinson had 5  receptions for 53 yards.? While those numbers are=
=20
certainly not horrible,  they're not quite what we expect from Marcus.? He=
=20
could improve with  another week of practice but I'm a little concerned rig=
ht=20
now.

WR Joe Horn (NO)? As I  mentioned above, I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but=
=20
there is no way that he's  anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff=
=20
Blake.? Of special worry was  the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable=20
throwing the ball to Willie  Jackson.

WR Donald Hayes?(Car)?  Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his statu=
s=20
for next week is  uncertain.? He's a vital part of the offense and will be=
=20
missed if he can't  go.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ)? As the  Jets have struggled, so has Chrebet.? He=20
turned in another small game  Sunday with 22 yards on 2 catches.? These=20
numbers just won't get it done  for a #1 WR.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)? 2 weeks  ago, it was Amani Toomer taking the hard=20
shot.? Last week it was Hilliard  with the highlight hit.? He looks like he=
=20
may miss a game or two which is  bad news for Hilliard owners but good news=
=20
of Joe Jurevicius  owners.

?

TEs Moving Down

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl)? Kelly's  just too up and down to rely on to any=20
degree.? When he's featured in the  gameplan, he's?a nice player and can be=

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

?

QBs Moving Up

QB Gus Frerotte (Den)? You have  to love Frerotte stepping in and performin=
g=20
like he did.? Of course, when  you throw the ball 58 times, good things oft=
en=20
happen.? When you throw the  ball 58 times with a 62% completion percentage=
,=20
great things happen.? Look  for more of the same.

QB Kerry Collins (NYG)? The  Giants may be struggling but Collins continues=
=20
to put up excellent Fantasy  Football numbers.? With guys like Kurt Warner=
=20
and Daunte Culpepper, it's  easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs=
=20
come from great teams.? Not  always the case as Collins is showing.? Often=
=20
times, it's teams with  vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco=
=20
that provides the QB  motivation to play catch-up.? Collins looks comfortab=
le=20
in the pocket and  if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike=20
Hilliard healthy for four  quarters, who knows what might happen.

QB Brett Favre (GB)? He's  baaaaack.? I said last week that Favre coming ba=
ck=20
on the bad foot would be  storybook material for a storybook kind of guy an=
d=20
Favre delivered.? 2 TDs  and 301 yards have the Packers riding high and=20
believing they can?make some  noise.? WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an=20
excellent #2 WR and RB Ahman Green  is filling the void left by Dorsey=20
Levens.?=20

QB Aaron Brooks (NO)? I may be  in the minority (imagine that...) but I was=
=20
very impressed with Brooks taking  over for Jeff Blake.? He was not a #2 QB=
=20
like Jim Miller in Chicago that  knew he'd be inserted any minute.? Brooks=
=20
was thrust into the game and  responded very nicely.? He's skinny at #205 b=
ut=20
tall (6' 4"")? Big  league arm and nice mobility.? Of particular note was hi=
s=20
tendency to throw  to WR Willie Jackson.? We'll see if that continues.? Sur=
e,=20
he's a long  shot but if you're desperate for a QB, he could be a nice =20
surprise.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD)? Hold the  presses, Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade=
=20
list.? Seriously, he's an  easy target and I'll admit to taking my share of=
=20
shots but you can't deny the  guy has skills.? Yes, there were some fluky=
=20
plays with Crockett injuring  himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw=
.?=20
(although the 3 TDs on 13  completions did make for a wild looking box scor=
e=20
for Leaf)? He's got some  weapons in Jeff Graham, Curtis Conway and his bes=
t=20
receiver, TE Freddie  Jones.? He's as flaky as they come but he might be=20
worth a look if you're  dying at QB.

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Fred Taylor (Jac)? Taylor  put together one of the best performances of=
=20
the year Sunday night.? The  fact that he did it against the very tough rus=
h=20
defense of the Steelers makes it  even all the more impressive.? This isn't=
=20
like rolling up 200 yards on the  Cowboys or Cardinals.? Clearly, there's=
=20
reason for huge hope as if he can  do this against Pittsburgh, he can do it=
=20
against anyone.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? Once  again, Lewis ran hard.? He's got to be consider=
ed=20
one of the better RBs in  the game right now.? I still worry about how=20
durable he'll be but he's  looked great lately averaging 6.7 yards per carr=
y=20
Sunday for 187 yards.? If  it weren't for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturin=
g=20
a TD here and there, he'd be  even higher.

RB Darnell Autry (Phi)? Autry  refuses to hand over the #1 RB job to Stanle=
y=20
Pritchett or anyone else.?  He's not very flashy but he gets the job done=
=20
both rushing and receiving.?  The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in=
=20
the standings and Autry figures to  be a large part of that success.

RB Ahman Green (GB)? I'd be a  little worried right now if I were Dorsey=20
Levens.? Green averaged 6.4 yards  per carry Sunday as he rolled up 180 tot=
al=20
yards.? Most importantly, was  his number of fumbles: Zero.? No one's ever=
=20
doubted his incredible physical  skills, but now he seems to be bringing th=
e=20
mental game to go with  it.

RB Mike Anderson (Den)? I hate  to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a grea=
t=20
impression of Isaac Bruce's  maddening 1998 on again, off again season.? As=
=20
you know, Davis missed  another game and once again, Anderson stepped in=20
nicely.?? By now, you  know it's tough to predict what Davis is going to do=
=20
each week so it looks to me  as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup.

RB Jamal Anderson (Atl)?  Anderson's 4.5 yards per carry reminded many of h=
is=20
1998 season.? He's  running with power and speed and finally appears to be=
=20
over the knee  injury.? I think he's been over it physically for a while no=
w=20
but it seems  he's handling the mental aspect too.

?

WRs Moving Up

WR Willie Jackson (NO)? New QB  Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being=20
thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson  responded well with 4 catches and=
=20
85 yards including 2 TDs.? Often times,  you'll see a backup QB favor the=
=20
backup WRs as they're familiar with them.?  We'll see if this continues.? I=
'm=20
guessing Brooks will get comfortable  throwing to Joe Horn this week but=20
Jackson is still definitely worth a  shot.

WR Joe Jurevicius (NYG)? As I  mentioned above, QB Kerry Collins is playing=
=20
very well. With Ike Hilliard set to  miss some time, Jurevicius should get =
a=20
chance to show what he can do.?  He's long been a Fantasy Football tease=20
showing flashes but never really having  the opportunity for playing time.?=
=20
Let's see what he can  do.

WR Terry Glenn (NE)? I've  been?high on Glenn since June.? He made me look=
=20
good early on but had  cooled midseason.? He's now back warming up again an=
d=20
for you Glenn owners,  your patience is paying off.? QB Drew Bledsoe didn't=
=20
have a TD, but he did  roll up the yards.? Once again, Glenn was the prime =
=20
target.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)? Smith  looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as=
=20
the Jags awakened their  offense?Sunday night.? Smith seems back in synch=
=20
with QB Mark Brunell  and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game.=
?=20
There may not be  enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enoug=
h=20
for  Smith.

WR James McNight (Dal)? Yes,  he's a long shot considering the horrid play =
of=20
Troy Aikman Sunday but you have  to like a WR who's getting a ton of looks.=
?=20
And McNight's getting those  looks from Aikman.? Can't make plays without t=
he=20
ball...

?

TEs Moving Up

TE Jay Reimersma (Buf)? We've  been waiting for Reimersma to return to form=
=20
and he looks to be on his  way.? He was heavily involved and seemed=20
comfortable with ""new"" QB Rob  Johnson.? He can be a vital part of the=20
offense and you have to think  Johnson will continue to utilize him.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)? Mangum's  no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a=
=20
nice target.? 4 catches for 47  yards is an improvement from what they've h=
ad=20
at TE and it looks like he's back  and healthy now.

?

Players Moving  Down

?

QBs Moving Down

QB Steve Beuerlein (Car)?  There's only so much a QB can do by himself.? He=
=20
lost Wesley Walls a couple  of weeks ago. I thought Beuerlein could handle=
=20
losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but  losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injur=
y=20
proved too much.? His OL is less  than stellar and he's just not having muc=
h=20
time to throw.? =20

QB Shaun King (TB)? King swings  back toward the side of mediocrity after a=
=20
91 yard passing effort against  Chicago.? It looked that bad too.? Even for=
 a=20
Les Steckel  Offense.? Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a=
=20
positive as  teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson.

QB Steve McNair (Ten)? Not all  the turnovers Sunday were McNair's fault bu=
t=20
he certainly had a hand in  them.? His problem remains a lack of healthy WR=
s=20
and a stellar RB in Eddie  George who can carry the load.? Last year, it wa=
s=20
McNair vulturing TDs from  George but it doesn't seem to be a problem this=
=20
year.?=20

QB Jake Plummer (Ari)? If  you're a regular reader, you know I'm not a=20
Plummer fan.? I'm especially  not a fan now that he's hurt as well.? He may=
=20
get back soon but it won't  matter for this team that's in shambles=20
offensively.

?

RBs Moving Down

RB Thomas Jones (Ari)? Jones'  was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but=20
still, you like to see a better yards  per carry average than negative 2...

RB Kevin Faulk (NE)? Either  Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is=
=20
not a very good football  player.? How else do you explain Faulk earning on=
e=20
carry while his RB  partner J.R. Redmond was inactive?? Patrick Pass got th=
e=20
bulk of the work  but was ineffective.? I'm guessing, it's the fumbling tha=
t=20
earned his spot  in the doghouse.?=20

RB Ron Dayne (NYG)? As we've  said so often in the past, Ron Dayne's=20
productivity is tied directly to how well  the Giants are playing.? If New=
=20
York is leading, you'll see Dayne.? If  they're trailing, it's the Tiki=20
Barber show.? Lately, it's been more Tiki  than Dayne.? And if the Giants=
=20
don't make some improvements on defense, I  don't see that changing.

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)?  Prentice got folks excited early in the year but=
=20
he's been disappointing of  late.? Prentice is losing carries to Jamel Whit=
e=20
and that doesn't look to  change anytime soon.?=20

?

WRs Moving Down

WR Marcus Robinson (Chi)?  Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it=
=20
appears the QB rotation is  affecting his play.? With Shane Matthews=20
starting, Robinson had 5  receptions for 53 yards.? While those numbers are=
=20
certainly not horrible,  they're not quite what we expect from Marcus.? He=
=20
could improve with  another week of practice but I'm a little concerned rig=
ht=20
now.

WR Joe Horn (NO)? As I  mentioned above, I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but=
=20
there is no way that he's  anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff=
=20
Blake.? Of special worry was  the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable=20
throwing the ball to Willie  Jackson.

WR Donald Hayes?(Car)?  Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his statu=
s=20
for next week is  uncertain.? He's a vital part of the offense and will be=
=20
missed if he can't  go.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ)? As the  Jets have struggled, so has Chrebet.? He=20
turned in another small game  Sunday with 22 yards on 2 catches.? These=20
numbers just won't get it done  for a #1 WR.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)? 2 weeks  ago, it was Amani Toomer taking the hard=20
shot.? Last week it was Hilliard  with the highlight hit.? He looks like he=
=20
may miss a game or two which is  bad news for Hilliard owners but good news=
=20
of Joe Jurevicius  owners.

?

TEs Moving Down

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl)? Kelly's  just too up and down to rely on to any=20
degree.? When he's featured in the  gameplan, he's?a nice player and can be=
=20
effective.? It's just that  it's so hard to guess what game that will be...

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ)? Another  Jet receiver that's struggling.? Becht is=
=20
frustrating as he'll show some  nice flashes and then disappear for long=20
stretches.? I'm afraid to say he's  starting to look like...a Jet's TE.

16010,bass-e/all_documents/39.,<4954860.1075854572567.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"ELECTION INTEGRITY UPDATE:

Thanks again for your support,  we've now sent over 270,000
letters to Al Gore urging him to concede for the good of the
country.  Keep the heat on by spreading the word!

Hopefully, the U.S. Supreme Court will throw out the
unwarranted decision of the Florida Supreme Court to force
new recounts of the so-called ""undervote.""  I'd hate to think
of our next president being decided by Democrat activists
divining the intent of voters who didn't cast a clear vote.

Unfortunately, even if the Supreme Court rules against Al Gore
today or tomorrow, many of his supporters are urging that he
still refuse to concede.

In fact, the Washington Times reports that former New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, wants the Gore camp to focus on persuading two or
three Republican electors to defect from Mr. Bush. That would
result in a tie in the Electoral College or even a win for
Mr. Gore.

Here is what Mr. Cuomo had to say:

""There's no guarantee that three or four electors who were
previously supposed to vote for Bush wouldn't turn around, out
of anger and confusion, perhaps, and say, we're going to go
with Al Gore,"" he said.

Mr. Cuomo openly suggested that if Mr. Gore loses the U.S.
Supreme Court case, the next step for Democrats ""could be to
convince some electors previously thought to be committed to
Bush. You only need three to make Al Gore president, even if
he loses Florida. Think about that.""

My friend, regardless of whether or not Al Gore officially
supports these actions, there will likely be many attempts to
sway individual electors to overturn the certified election
results.

Political pundits have suggested that if the Supreme Court rules
against him, Al Gore will end the contest of the election
results but will NOT fully concede.  That's not enough.  America
NEEDS a full concession from Al Gore so that we can finally
move on.

But -- as long as Al Gore thinks he has enough public support --
there's no telling how long he'll drag this thing out.  That's
why we are going to keep hammering away with our public call for
Mr. Gore's to concede.

Please continue to send your friends, family and anyone who will
listen to our call for action to sign their letter to Al Gore at
http://www.ElectionIntegrity.com  You're doing great work!


For Integrity,

Bruce Eberle
