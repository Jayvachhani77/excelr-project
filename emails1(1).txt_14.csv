is found guilty - he chose the jury.)  I am in the office now for an 8:30

(excelr's EVP of Investor Relations) was summoned for jury duty on Tuesday as

I had to report for jury duty today (along with 500 others from Harris

The case will continue on Wednesday, so our scheduled time for a conference

I am president of my sorority at OU and because of my obligations to it, I
have to be back in Norman by the 23 of July, making my last day of a summer
job the 20th of July.  I did notice that the summer analyst program is 12
weeks long and I wouldn't be able to work  a full 12 weeks.
The dates I am available are May 14-July 20.  I don't know if this presents
a problem, but I wanted to check with you.  I would really like to take the

Sally 

This is great but you are right in that we probably do not have time to cross 
calibrate for the full global population of Risk Ops - perhaps next year. 
Also, from discussions with Fernley the higher grades will form part of Rick 
Causey's PRC ranking process - so we are left with lower risk post that ( 
Fernley said he would forward his note to Rick to yourself ).

My remaining concern is that any promotions, particularly in the risk group, 
which are not matched across Houston/London or indeed between EGM London and 
EEL London may create people risk. Can I suggest we compare promotions from 
senior specialist ( up to manager ) upwards ?

Hope everything is going well

Subject: Re: Cross calibration for Operations people globally  

I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be 
held in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be 
held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC 
meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary 
due to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed 
in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  

The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM 
and EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior 
Specialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review 
meetings mirror the ""preferred distribution"", which as you probably know 
suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should 
therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work 
has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not 
be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the 
managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good 
jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing 
suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I 
still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss 
my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of 
course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels 
that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my 
direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda 
Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to 
attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  

Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this 
year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the 
year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in 
Houston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would 
make sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.

I have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about 
checking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) 
which raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross 
calibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?

The off-cycle department of the Associate and Analyst program needs your 
help!  

We are looking for volunteer interviewers for the following dates:

Thursday, December 7th from 9:00 a.m. -12:30 p.m.

Over 50 candidates will be interviewing this day.  The candidates will be a 
combination of Associates and Analysts representing schools such as Harvard, 
Princeton, SMU, MIT, University of Illinois, Emory and many others.  Each 
candidate will have 4 interviews.  Pending the outcome of their interviews we 
will invite them to stay and attend Super Saturday that weekend.  If for some 
reason we decide not to further pursue the candidate, we will fly them home 
that Friday morning.

In addition to the interviews on December 7th there will be a breakfast 
buffet from 7:45 a.m. to 8:45 a.m.  and a luncheon from 12:30 p.m. - 2:00

and both breakfast and lunch will be held in the Regency Room.

We are asking excelr employees associate (associates who have been with the 
program for at least one year) level or higher  to volunteer at least ONE 
HOUR to interview candidates (this will be 2 interviews).  If you can 
volunteer for more than an hour or for more than just one of the stated 
dates, that would be great!  Your help is needed!  Please contact my 
assistant, Cathy Lira, at cathy.lira@excelr.com or x54049 as soon as possible, 
if you can volunteer any time for interviewing.  Please include the times 
that you can interview and whether or not you will be able to join us for

previous conversation she was a new Sen Dir at the start of the year - right?

Thanks.

Elisabeth,

Could you get me a phyiscal copy of the review please.

Thanks.

one week extension of the Temporary VaR allocation of $5MM to UK Power that 
was made last week in the e-mail referenced below.  So the limit changes as 
of 12/12/00 for excelr Europe:
  
   through 12/22/00 12/23/00 - 12/31/00 1/1/01
1) UK Power VaR $20.3MM  $15.3MM  $13.95MM
     UK Power NOP 68 Twh   68 Twh   59.5 Twh

If UK Power feels they need a VaR limit in excess of the schedule above, they 
will need to meet with Ted Murphy and Rick Buy to discuss it further.  
Currently, we have no Discretionary VaR available for allocation, but 
re-allocation from another commodity group may be technically possible at 
some point.  Although
several other commodity groups are vying for the same VaR capital.

2) European Gas - NOP and Maturity/Gap Limits revert to permanent limits on 
1/1/01 (as previously scheduled),  of 60 Bcf and 90 Bcf, respectively

3) Credit Trading - now includes the Debt Trading commodity group, and has 
one combined limit structure:
  NOP                  Maturity/Gap  VaR 
 $750,000 DV01/bp total        N/A   $5 MM
 $  50,000 DV01/bp individual


4) Commodity Group Loss Notification requirements were changed as follows 
(note: business units are encouraged to establish sub-limits):
      Effective 12/12/00  Previous
Daily Loss in any Commodity group or Portfolio:

? Report to Business Unit Office of the Chairman 100% of VaR   not 
specifically stated
? Report to excelr Corp. President   125% of VaR   50% of VaR
? Report to excelr Corp. Chairman   150% of VaR    75% of VaR
? Report to Audit Committee   no reporting at commodity  all are reported 
quarterly
group level   

Cumulative 5-day Loss in any Commodity Group or Portfolio:

? Report to Business Unit Office of the Chairman 125% of VaR   not 
specifically stated
? Report to excelr Corp. President   150% of VaR    75% of VaR
? Report to excelr Corp. Chairman   175% of VaR    100% of VaR

I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be 
held in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be 
held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC 
meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary 
due to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed 
in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  

The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM 
and EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior 
Specialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review 
meetings mirror the ""preferred distribution"", which as you probably know 
suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should 
therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work 
has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not 
be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the 
managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good 
jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing 
suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I 
still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss 
my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of 
course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels 
that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my 
direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda 
Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to 
attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  

Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this 
year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the 
year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in

Subject: excelr Metals FX

Rick,

I thought you might be interested in some information brought to me today by 
Andy Cornfield (Director with the London Risk Management Operations team), 
with regard to FX positions at excelr Metals:-

The overall FX exposure of the metals business is not yet routinely laid off 
with the FX / Interest rates desk.  

Euro currency exposure associated with a Euro Aluminium option is managed by 
Tim Jones, the Head of the Metals Financial Trading desk.  This position is 
managed under a limit of $30m, which was MG's old FX limit.   excelr Metals is 
treating this limit as an excelr Corporate FX limit for the purposes of 
managing this position and all other FX exposure.

Proprietary FX positions are occasionally being taken - most recently, Andy 
has found that yesterday a metals trader opened a long Euro 5 million 
position for value 28/11.  The trader is not the principal FX trader on the 
metals desk, although he was formerly an FX trader with Billiton (acquired by 
MG in 1999)  and he became MG's assistant FX trader prior to excelr's 
acquisition of MG.

With regard to the last item, Risk Management and RAC discussed this with 
Mike Hutchinson and it was agreed that the Euro 5m position will be closed 
out tomorrow. 

As far as the first two items are concerned, RAC and Risk Management will be 
working with Commercial heads to help ensure that excelr Corporate policy is 
clearly communicated and applied.

FYI - no action required

This note and an earlier email ( forwarded separately ) highlights issues 
around some transactions originated within Metals that arose due to 
'misunderstanding' of limits - which was work in progress for Andrew 
Cornfield ( Risk ), Lloyd Fleming ( RAC ) and Shane Dallman ( FX desk  - 
reporting to Gary Hickerson ) working with the Metal Commercial MDs on the 
subject of an exemption from Corp policy for IR and FX hedging.

It is pleasing that people in the control environment picked up the issues on 
a timely basis but disappointing that a firm conclusion between the 
Commerical groups on 'delegated' limits took longer than anticipated.

Subject: excelr Metals FX status

The following issues have been resolved today following discussions with 
Metals Commercial, Risk Management and RAC:

5m Euro prop trade:  It has been agreed that this will be closed out 
immediately.  Metals traders will be advised that FX exposure may only be 
generated as part of a hedge position to an underlying metal trade, and that 
any FX exposure must be laid off via Roger  Murray-Evans (Metals FX trader) 
and the Global Markets desk.

Averaging trades (FX and Bullion): Change method of booking trades so that 
the averaging leg of all trades is booked as it arises (i.e. daily) and the 
resulting FX exposure is captured daily and laid off with Global Markets as 
part of the metals aggregation.

A number of other matters, which have been under discussion for some time, 
were also agreed:- 

Euro / Ali option:  Currently operates under a $30m FX limit and is managed 
by Tim Jones.  It has been agreed that this limit will be reduced to $20m 
(EMRAC to approve) and be a part of Gary Hickerson's limit.  As the options 
expire, the limit will be progressively reduced.  The limit applies only to 
this transaction and does not cover any other FX dealing by excelr Metals.  
Any subsequent transactions of this nature will be covered under separately 
proposed limits.

Overnight exposure: excelr Metals to apply for a small overnight limit to 
cover trades booked after the end of day cut-off.   $2m total net open 
position has been proposed, to be agreed with Gary Hickerson and form part of 
his limits.

FX position management:  FX exposure generated through the day to be 
aggregated and passed to the Global Markets desk.

concerns regarding swaptions and asian options are accurate.  IT is currently 
working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use.  IT is also working on 
correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly.  London trades 
many more swaptions and asian options than the US; therefore, the impact of 
not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them.  
The majority of options in the U.S. are European monthly and daily exercises

idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the US, but other 
more material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal

financial market) we will need to enhance Enpower to follow suit.  Swaption 
vols and asian options are two of these enhancements. 

Also, it is difficult to get option data out of Enpower.  We have in stage an 
option sensitivity matrix that, once implemented into production. I will be 
sure that James knows about.  It probably will not solve all his problems, 
but it will give him a starting place.

Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power 
volatilities and correlations

As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power 
traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option 
portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that 
the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in 
their mark.

In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light. 
Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as 
this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a 
matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you 
may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the 
deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. 

The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue 
for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at 
the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot 
use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise 
options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any 
way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the 
few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' 
piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of 
worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the 
correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) 
the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  
underlying. 

They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel 
who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most 
experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). 
This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of 
excelr's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the 
volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that 
different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value 
the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns 
over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it 
does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc 
calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike 
price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the 
forward price of the underlying itself. 

We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in 
Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start 
to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.

Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or 
gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no 
there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure 
given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what 
the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have 
Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega 
or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to 
work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like 
to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem 
(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the 
implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current 
system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we 
validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?

Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher 
volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their 
VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily 
remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol 
curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any 
testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). 
The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the 
impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.

I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing 
the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been 
covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having 
to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and 
are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies 
of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have 
not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in 
gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that 
it is not for a lack of trying.

Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived 
inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.

approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :



The primary control issues are:
? Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had 
not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)

approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.

27818,beck-s/all_documents/881.,<26690998.1075855765247.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"In the past few months, the procedures for setting up new curves and books 
have not been followed by everyone. 

The following memo documents the procedures to 1) set up a new curve, 2) set 
up a new book, and 3) change a portfolio hierarchy.  Please note that risk 
management (for each commodity group), ""risk management""  is responsible for 
ensuring that information is flowing appropriately between the valuation 
systems and RisktRAC (Risk Analysis and Reporting can help, but do not have 
all of the ERMS information to be able to ensure the completeness of 
RisktRAC).

I have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of 
this memo.  Please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy. 

The procedure to set up a new curve is as follows:

Trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new 
curve set up
Trader communicates this to risk management
Risk management constructs new curve in ERMS (with the help of the IT 
department)
Risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in 
RisktRAC
Curve form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up curve in RisktRAC
A system generated message is sent to people on the ""curve list"" indicating a 
change in the RisktRAC curves has been made

If the curve is not set up in RisktRAC the positions are not captured in the 
VAR or engine, thereby making VAR inaccurate.  As a side note, Risk Analysis 
and Reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new 
curves set up in ERMS are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in 
RisktRAC.  We did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in 
ERMS that are not in RisktRAC - which we are working with you to resolve.

The procedure to set up a new book in RisktRAC is as follows:

Trader/risk management determines new book is needed
New book request form (for RisktRAC) is completed by risk management
New book request form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up book in RisktRAC
Risk Analysis and Reporting forwards request to ERMS administrator and global 
counterparty group to request that book is set up in valuation and 
counterparty systems
Once all groups have completed their individual set ups, a final e-mail is 
sent to personnel on the ""books list"" and the book administrator in the risk 
management department who requested the book

It is important that there is a one to one link between the ERMS and RisktRAC 
books, or not all positions will be captured in RisktRAC (two commodities per 
ERMS book does not flow properly into RisktRAC).

The above two processes have formally existed for a number of months.  
Additionally, we are formalizing the procedure for changing portfolio 
hierarchies.  The procedure now is:

Risk management is responsible for requesting all portfolio hierarchy 
changes.  Previously, changes could be made through a request by Risk 
Analysis and Reporting or RAC.  These two groups are no longer allowed to 
submit change requests.  All requests must come through risk management.
Risk management completes a request, including the reason for the requested 
change in structure
Risk management forwards the request to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting makes the change and notifies risk management 
that the change has been made.

James,

It appears only the UK Gas MTM made it for the V@R run in Houston today.

UK Power:  (despite the spotlight  being on this feed due to the first run of 
the new evaluation system) was officialised late and required the below 
mentioned adjustment.

Contintental Power : Officialised late ?

Nordic Power : was officialised around 11am London time - the slowness of the 
current feed to Houston prevented the feed reaching there on time (feed has 
been rewritten by IT to speed up the process  and is currently in UAT) 
however, it appears the normal time for officialisation this book is around 
10.30am which allows the feed to hit to normally hit on time. 

Appreciate if you could looked into the above.


Regards

David

Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

excelr WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming excelr Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
excelr=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

excelr Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include excelr=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) excelr Global Assets.  In addition, excelr=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of excelr Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of excelr Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of excelr APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of excelr Global Assets. excelr Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of excelr=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of excelr APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of excelr India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
excelr=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into excelr Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of excelr Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of excelr Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

excelr Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of excelr Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

excelr Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to excelr Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating excelr=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, excelr Americas.  excelr Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for excelr=20
Americas.

excelr Europe
The excelr Europe organization, which includes excelr=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and excelr Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

excelr Global Markets
excelr Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for excelr=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
excelr Global Assets.  excelr Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

excelr Industrial Markets
excelr Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of excelr Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other excelr businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=

Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
excelr Net Works, and excelr Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for excelr Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20

=20
well as providing support for excelr Global Markets and excelr Global Assets.=

Sally,

I have not worked directly with Sheri Thomas until last week.  I work with 
members of her group and we have successfully managed to take care of 
trader's wishes for more flexibility related to logging in one time and 
having the trades mapped to the appropriate system depending on commodity 
traded.  The process is still taken care of through 'back-screen' programming 
and in my opinion should be easier to apply to all traders with 
cross-commodity portfolios.  The only one on one contact I have had with 
Sheri was to request that Power Risk be involved in the approval process when 
a trader was requesting an EOL login id.  There have been instances when 
traders will get set up on EOL but have not been set up in Enpower.  When 
this happens their transaction will not bridge because there is no place for 
them to go as Enpower has no way of recognizing them as a trader.  Sheri 
talked to one of her group members and had them include myself and my leads 
(for back-up) into the approval process of EOL trader setup.

She was understanding and responsive to my request.  I do not feel that I 
have had the appropriate exposure to her work to give her a formal rating, 
but I wanted to share the minimal experience I have had for your reviewal 
process.

Since a majority of the activity is power related, I would imagine that

Scott

With all our reporting changing to London Office and now it appears some 
restructure of risk and the broadening of Sally's role, what are we going to 
do for the second report for our new risk manager, Justin Den Hertog - he has 
taken over from Alan.

He reports to me locally, but functionally he would traditionally have 
reported to you on behalf of Sally's area. I assume this has now moved with 
the rest of us and would therefore be either James New or Mike Jordan in 
London? Can you please advise me via return email as we are working on our 
PEP stuff, reviews etc.

supporting more risk on an inferior platform is close to zero.  More 
importantly in the global competition for capital of all kind, the standard 
is not controlled spreadsheets, i.e., last time I spoke to Peter Lynch, Jim 
Rogers, and Archie McCallister, they were on more sophisticated platforms 
with infinitely more functionality.

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.

Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel 
knowledge to come up with a different solution.  Everyone will have to 
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Steve

With all our reporting changing to London Office and now it appears some 
restructure of risk and the broadening of Sally's role, what are we going to 
do for the second report for our new risk manager, Justin Den Hertog - he has

areas of needing some spot ""1-on-1"" training for users, more experience in 
overall information retrieval, editing of some reports, our security process 
and the difficulty of getting information from various and sundry databases 
(since SAP is interfaced) to get the full picture.

We have passed all these items on to the appropriate Solution Mgr, so that 
they can specifically address them.

As I think I mentioned several months ago we had complaints about 
nonresponsiveness (calls not being returned, being passed around alot, etc).  
Hopefully we've turned the corner there.

Subject: ENA Summary

Kathy,

Please find the highlights below from my ENA customer meetings:

Bryce Baxter

Pleased overall with the support provided by the ISC

Small issues voiced by Bryce, not strong sources of contention :
Feels the response time does not happen with 'lightning speed', but works 
fine once they agree to a deadline with Pamela LeBrane
Zcash specification changes delayed due to errors identified by both groups, 
but they are still moving forward
Payment runs are generated early on occassion and it is tough to cancel a 
payment (they are blocking all payments now to avoid this issue)
Unify to SAP interface - files are not being picked up at least once a week 
(certain files 'drop off'); Mary Tyler Marz (ENA) and Teresa Mira (ISC) are 
working on this issue 

Leslie Reeves
Pleased overall with the support provided by the ISC

Areas Leslie would like assistance from the ISC:
Further editing on reports; understanding what information is available and 
how they can extract the information from SAP
Further training (coaching sessions) by members of the ISC Solution Teams to 
help with the following areas:
How to pull data from SAP (data mining)
Explanation of how to find all the pieces required to complete their monthly 
reconciliation process (balancing cost centers, reconciling the P&L to the G/L
Explanation of the interface reconciliation process for financial out of 
balances
Explanation of the steps required for new accounts, business areas, cost 
centers, allocation process (needs to fully understand the process in SAP)
Follow up with Debbie Brackett in Credit to determine if she is receiving the 
credit information from SAP in a timely manner
I told Leslie that I would follow up with Susan B. and Brandee and ask them 
to call her directly.  Leslie would like to meet with each of them and then 
determine the correct individuals on her team to become involved in the 
process.

Both Bryce and Leslie were very appreciative of the customer focused 
attention from the ISC.  They both thought it was great that we scheduled 
time to visit with them and understand their questions/issues.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you for taking time to meet with me today about the ISC and SAP.  I 
appreciated your explanations and your feedback.  Please see if I have 
captured the main points below.  If so, no need to reply.  If not, please 
provide corrections or elaborations.  

I will talk with Sheila and Brandee about the best course of action to get 
Laura Scott's feedback about the issues in Canada.  I'll also check on the 
status of Hyperion.

I passed along your comments about Michael Gilmore to both Michael and his 
manager Vince Cacaro.  Both were pleased to receive positive customer 
feedback.

Regards,

ENA's (Financial) SAP ""Wish List""

Earlier inter-company cutoffs in month-end close, to facilitate the overall 
close process.
Clarity around the status of Hyperion -- will it be here beyond the end of 
the year?  If so, will the process for mapping between FI/CO and Hyperion be 
addressed?
Getting all the information for our customers into the same repository.  Brio 
should be the answer to many of our issues, as it should ultimately integrate 
data from the Tag database (ERMS), Empower, Unify, CPI, and Solark.  
A different type or level of support during month-end close, at least through 
1Q 2001.  In order of criticality, the issues/needs to be addressed are:
security (making sure people have the correct security and have it prior to 
month-end close)
cost center & profit center set-up (ultimately, centralized set-up is the 
right thing, but the process during close needs work)
reporting (quicker/better access to the right data post close)

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Steve

Duong,
Per our phone conversation, below is the list of people that would need 
access to EnPower production.

Currently, the Argentine Power group has in total about 20 physical forward 
deals  which will be done under excelr Comercializadora De Energia Argentina 
S.A.(Co. 027W) and one financial deal which will be done under excelr North 
America (Co. 0364). Given the fact that we'll also have deals on ENA, I would 
think that we could be on the Houston server. Just let us know.  
In the mean time, we'll be working with the various Global groups to have the 
proper desk, portfolio, facilities etc.... set up.

Thanks for your help,
Trang x3-6996

With all our reporting changing to London Office and now it appears some 
restructure of risk and the broadening of Sally's role, what are we going to 
do for the second report for our new risk manager, Justin Den Hertog - he has 
taken over from Alan.

He reports to me locally, but functionally he would traditionally have 
reported to you on behalf of Sally's area. I assume this has now moved with 
the rest of us and would therefore be either James New or Mike Jordan in 
London? Can you please advise me via return email as we are working on our 
PEP stuff, reviews etc.

is to identify the source of competitive advantage.  To my mind it's the same 
line of thought that leads us to see EOL as sustainable, but neutral B2B 
marketplaces as temporary.  Our only competitive advantage is that we are the 
largest principal member of the potential club, making our participation most 
critical.  Given this, our timing and positioning relative to potentially 
joining others may be the single most important strategic decision we make.  
I would enjoy hearing your thoughts on any other elements of competitve

sustainable.

Dear Kathy & Darren,
     I've spoken with Marcelo Parra here in New York regarding phone 
recording for the excelr Metals offices.  The RAC group insists that recording 
is done ASAP and I need to report back to Marcelo the install dates of the 
equipment in Montreal and St. Louis.  If you have such info or know who is 
responsible, please let me know.  
     I understand that we are several months away from the installation of a 
new switch with central recording capability here at the 520 Madison office 
in New York.   As an alternative, I can install a refurbished digital 
recording system for 24 telephones on the Concentrates and Metals trading 
desks for approximately $45,000.   The recording device will be located in 
our telephone room and is not accessible to the traders.  All equipment is in 
stock and we can have the desks recorded by December 1.   I need a quick 
approval since the vendor will only hold refurbished equipment until Friday 
afternoon for us.  Barry, can you give the OK?
    Also, recording for the Chicago office should not be an issue since the 
excelr Metals people are moving to the existing excelr Chicago facilities 
before the end of the year.

shown in the FRS.  The team would be happy to show you a demo at your 
convenience, perhaps early next week.  We anticipate our back office using 
FIX in parallel with existing systems for December 2000, and then using FIX 
""under fire"" for January 2001 invoices.

The demo uses actual data from Sempra, our largest volume natgas financial 
counterparty.  In about a minute, FIX is able to compare excelr data and 
Sempra data (received electronically as an excel spreadsheet and stored on a 
mini version of our Deal Database), immediately matching about 1450 of the 
1500 deals.  It then helps the user to manually match those 50 deals that the 
primary match engine could not.  This whole process, if it were purely 
manual, would take more than a day.  Using excel spreadsheets (and sort 
functions), excelr currently spends 4 to 8 hours per month matching Sempra 
invoices. FIX allows the user to perform all matching in about 10 minutes.

Our next deliverable is the Confirm Central module v1.0, due 1 December.  We 
anticipate delivering it on time, as we have with FIX.

potential liabilities of EOL were discussed.  Given our ASP model, we have to 
offer a system even more robust than EOL.  In a related area, we began to 
discuss security, including some of the latest, inexpensive biometrics 
stuff.  Feel free to partcipate in this discussion. Tommy will be the lead on 
these topics.....

Subject: Disaster Recovery / Business Resumption for Commodity Logic

One of the calculated risks ENA has lived with is the potential 
unavailability of systems given a disaster strikes the Houston area such as a 
hurricane that knocks out power, etc.

Have you given any thought on the commodity logic side of providing a 
hot-backup / fail-over capability from another location ?  This could be 
particularly critical with the Contract Exchange module and might be one 
assurance customers would want before signing up.

For that matter, is there a market in providing disaster recovery / 
hot-backup capability to companies in high-risk areas?  It has traditionally 
been thought of as too expensive to warrant implementing such a capability 
for our own purposes.  Perhaps there are economies of scale that can be 
recognized when providing this capability for many.

Cool--although I did tell little C that since I was big C Richard and I were
taking the guest room!  I am such a lovely sister, yes?

Richard really, really loves pecan pie--I may try and make it and bring it
if that is ok with you....or I may just bring one from Luby's....

Really--a pound of coffee would make him very happy for his birthday...

See you soon--

Thanks for the suggestions for Richard.  Let me know if you think of other
ideas - I need b'day and Christmas ideas.

Probably the easiest thing to bring for Thanksgiving could be a dessert --
or something else that is a favorite of your family.  I know that it is
really kind of hard to travel with food -- particularly since you will
probably be working on Wednesday morning.  I have made Thanksgiving dinner
for so many years (one of the few times that I really like to cook), that I
will be glad to cover it.  Your company will be the very best thing that
you can bring.  We are looking forward to having you all here.  (The
sleeper sofa for the media room will arrive this Friday!)

Hi...

Still trying to think of things for Richard.  Electric can opener,
Guatemalan Antigua coffee, new shirt for racquetball--he says XXL--hard to
find but most chain sporting good stores have that size--probably white or
something very basic with a collar.  He really does need this--his
racquetball duds are looking pretty bad...

We are looking forward to Thanksgiving--can't believe it is next week!
What
can we bring?

Subject: Head Trader Authorization

Greg -

We haven't met yet - I joined Market Risk Management working for Ted Murphy 
about a month ago, focusing on the Risk Management Policy.  One item I'm 
working on is documentation of the Head Traders and Authorized Traders.    It 
seems after the organizational anouncement last week that you are the top 
management and focal point for all of the trading activities in excelr 
Wholesale Services.  As such, would you please review the draft memo below 
(also attached) and confirm whether this appropriately documents your wishes 
as far as designation of Head Traders for each commodity group authorized in 
the policy?  We'd like to get Skilling/Buy to sign this top level of trading 
authority delegation.  Then I'll obtain from each of the Head Traders their 
respective lists of Authorized Traders to whom they've further delegated 
trading authority.  This will support Rick Buy's goal that RAC maintain a 
list of authorized traders, with the appropriate documentation of that 
authorization.

Please don't read anything into the assignments themselves if I got them 
wrong - we made an educated guess with all the recent reorganizations.  For 
example - who is the Head Trader for Southern Cone Gas and Power - is it 
really Kishkill?  And as McMahon and Bowen aren't traders, do trading 
activities for Pulp & Paper, Lumber and Steel fall to Sherriff or someone 
else?  

If you prefer me to obtain Head Trader names for each commodity group from 
Lavorato/Sherriff/Shankman, I can do so, but please confirm I have the 
commodity group responsibilities correct among the 3 of them.

Subject: 

Now that we have implemented SAP, the BUs have come together to form teams to 
fill the gaps and explore opportunities to make more efficient use of SAP in 
the areas of Financial, Human Resources and Global Sourcing.  Melissa Becker 
will coordinate the efforts of the various teams.

The Financial teams, including process leveraging (with Jan Johnson as lead) 
and reporting (led by Mark Frank), will be working together over the next 6 
to 12 months since their objectives touch or overlap in many areas.  
Together, this effort is Project Sunrise.  The teams will be gathering 
information from accounting personnel in each BU about key information needs 
and key processes, to identify opportunities that would benefit all BUs as 
well as to identify BU-specific opportunities that the BUs may wish to pursue.

The teams' objectives are to work with the BUs to:

1. Create better, more user-friendly reporting capabilities
A. Implement short term measures to address current ""hot"" reporting issues 
(e.g., labor distribution and project management) (Susan Bellinghausen is 
spearheading this effort.)
B. Develop and implement medium term measures to improve access to 
information (e.g., data warehouse with web-based access)
C. Develop and implement longer term web-based tool addressing 4 key areas 
(costs, P&L, counterparties and cash)
2. Improve processes to provide better quality, more timely information
A. Implement process changes required to execute reporting objectives
B. Shorten close process
C. Improve basic ""blocking & tackling"" related to controls 
D. Share best practices among BUs

Representatives from the BUs working on these two teams will be:

Steve Thatcher  ENA
Caroline Lothian Europe
Joe Darensbourg International regions
Howard Selzer  International regions
Steve Frazier  EES
Madeline Chan  EBS
Dave Wittenburg ETS
Jill Erwin  Corp Acctg and EGF

The following are subject matter experts (SMEs) in various BUs and functional 
groups who will spend varying amounts of their time in addressing specific 
issues.

James Weitekamp ETS (planning)
Sayed Khoja  EGM 
Allen Ueckert  International regions (project systems)
Glenn Kobes  Tax
Brandee Sanborn ISC

We will continue to identify others who will share their expertise.

The following people will be working specifically on data warehouse and 
web-based reporting initiatives:

Beverly Fennesey ISC 
Li Chan   ENA
Pat Cagney  EES

The teams will begin by interviewing persons identified by the CAO of each 
BU, to determine their information needs and to review their processes, while 
continuing to develop the data warehouse and creating the web-based reporting 
tool.  The efforts of the process leveraging and reporting teams are vital to 
our being able to quickly obtain key information to run our businesses.  I 
appreciate all of your efforts to date with regard to SAP and now, Project 
Sunrise.  The ultimate success of these efforts depends on all of us working

Sally - Plse see the attached summary that Risk Ops prepares for 
Frevert/Sherriff/Brown on excelr Europe every week.  Do your business unit 
controllers prepare something like this for the Americas, EGM, & EIM that we 
could use in our weekly briefing to Rick Buy?  What's happening is we try to 
prepare our own analysis of the trading P/L, and it really doesn't make much 
sense to do that since Ops is probably already doing it.  I'd love to get 
looped in to similar analyses for the other business units.  Also, do you 
know who I'd contact in  EES?  I'll call Barry Pearce for EBS.

As this report contains the same information as the Rick Buy report, I

The report is usually produced on Monday mornings UK time, so should be ready

Subject: Ops Weekly Update

Ted mentioned to me that you guys receive or participate or just know of some 
type of weekly excelr Europe update on Fridays for Sherriff??? or some top guy 
over there, and that Risk Operations (New/Jordan etc.) prepare a report for 
that update.  Meanwhile, back in Houston we (MRM) independently prepare a 
weekly update for Rick Buy on Thursdays.  I'd like to get a copy of the 
report done last week, and talk to whoever in MRM participates, if anyone 
does, or if it's just Ops then whoever that is.  I think Ted was thinking we 
could leverage off this report and maybe move Rick Buy's weekly update back a 
day to coincide.

Do you know what I'm talking about?  Or should I talk to Lloyd or Oliver? I'd 
like to discuss after the morning meeting tomorrow if you have a minute - 
maybe you can also fax or e-mail the report?  

Thanks,
Cassandra.

fill the gaps and explore opportunities to make more efficient use of SAP in 
the areas of Financial, Human Resources and Global Sourcing.  Melissa Becker 
will coordinate the efforts of the various teams.

The Financial teams, including process leveraging (with Jan Johnson as lead) 
and reporting (led by Mark Frank), will be working together over the next 6 
to 12 months since their objectives touch or overlap in many areas.  
Together, this effort is Project Sunrise.  The teams will be gathering 
information from accounting personnel in each BU about key information needs 
and key processes, to identify opportunities that would benefit all BUs as 
well as to identify BU-specific opportunities that the BUs may wish to pursue.

The teams' objectives are to work with the BUs to:

1. Create better, more user-friendly reporting capabilities
A. Implement short term measures to address current ""hot"" reporting issues 
(e.g., labor distribution and project management) (Susan Bellinghausen is 
spearheading this effort.)
B. Develop and implement medium term measures to improve access to 
information (e.g., data warehouse with web-based access)
C. Develop and implement longer term web-based tool addressing 4 key areas 
(costs, P&L, counterparties and cash)
2. Improve processes to provide better quality, more timely information
A. Implement process changes required to execute reporting objectives
B. Shorten close process
C. Improve basic ""blocking & tackling"" related to controls 
D. Share best practices among BUs

Representatives from the BUs working on these two teams will be:

Steve Thatcher  ENA
Caroline Lothian Europe
Joe Darensbourg International regions
Howard Selzer  International regions
Steve Frazier  EES
Madeline Chan  EBS
Dave Wittenburg ETS
Jill Erwin  Corp Acctg and EGF

The following are subject matter experts (SMEs) in various BUs and functional 
groups who will spend varying amounts of their time in addressing specific 
issues.

James Weitekamp ETS (planning)
Sayed Khoja  EGM 
Allen Ueckert  International regions (project systems)
Glenn Kobes  Tax
Brandee Sanborn ISC

We will continue to identify others who will share their expertise.

The following people will be working specifically on data warehouse and 
web-based reporting initiatives:

Beverly Fennesey ISC 
Li Chan   ENA
Pat Cagney  EES

The teams will begin by interviewing persons identified by the CAO of each 
BU, to determine their information needs and to review their processes, while 
continuing to develop the data warehouse and creating the web-based reporting 
tool.  The efforts of the process leveraging and reporting teams are vital to 
our being able to quickly obtain key information to run our businesses.  I 
appreciate all of your efforts to date with regard to SAP and now, Project

John Sherriff writes.......

excelr Trading is all about a unique combination of being ""tight"" and 
""loose"".  We give the managers of our trading books tremendous freedom 
(""loose"")
to make decisions on the spot and manage for profitability.  We can do this 
because we have a standard way of controlling (""tight"") that is consistent
from trading book to trading book.

Summarized below are the highlights of our fundamental risk management 
standards.  These standards are an integral part of our trading discipline 
and culture and we expect all our employees both commercial and noncommercial 
to absolutely understand these control standards.  These standards will 
evolve over time (especially as we move to new electronic trading methods) 
but the basics of separation of duties and accurate reporting are at the 
cornerstone of
our business.  So please ask plenty of questions about these standards, make 
sure you understand them and let us know when we are not living up to them.  

Questions and feedback should be directed to Mike Jordan on extension 34703.



RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS IN A TRADING ENVIRONMENT

To manage operational risk in a trading environment excelr has designed and 
implemented operational control standards. These standards, which are common 
for all businesses, aim to prevent errors and inaccuracies and ensure the 
timely recording of trading transactions. 

What standards does excelr have in place?

excelr has six fundamental standards for risk management that cover:
- Recording transactions
- Reporting daily profit & loss and risk positions
- Confirmation and execution of transactions
- Settlements with counterparties
- Risk management and settlement system information reflected in the general 
ledger
- Implementation of business and control infrastructure

What else is important when controls are implemented?

Implementing segregation of duties within the trading environment ensures 
that no individual has control over all phases of a transaction.   This 
allows incompatible functional responsibilities to be kept separate, 
specifically:
- Authorization and execution of transactions
- Recording and performance of transactions
- Monitoring and review of trading activities 

Why do we need to standardised controls?

To assimilate new or build existing commodity businesses excelr needs to be 
nimble and responsive. A robust and stable control process can be duplicated 
or flexed quickly and confidently, providing scalability and the capability 
to assess and manage operational risk.

How do we measure successful control?

By identifying and reporting metrics for all standards we build an 
understanding of compliance across all businesses and seek continual 
improvement. This compliments the qualitative cross-checking process 
facilitated by communication between Commercial, Risk Management Operations 
and RAC.

The control measurement process will be part of a global initiative across 
all commodities and locations.

Where can you find details of our fundamental standards?

Shona

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the 
transparency and accountability of issues raised. 

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient' 
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin 
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the 
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from 
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get 
an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we 
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a 
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their 
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down 

Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns 
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems 
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues
Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate 
that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date. 
Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict 
systematically with the above instructions
All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls 
exist and function in NY
Marcelo / Me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business 
communications on roles and responsibilities
Myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and 
monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens

Will call later

Subject: Rollout of ATHENA (Formerly known as the DPR database)


Dear All,
 
Risk Analytics, has recently finished developing ATHENA (the database that 
warehouses all of the official DPR data of excelr), which is designed to make 
your work easier by giving you the following tools and breakdowns:

1. P&L Component Breakdowns
? Hedge Management
? Prudency
? Curve Shift
? New Deals

2. Risk Analysis Tools
? VARs
? Maturity Gap Risk
? Net Open Position
? Daily loss limits

The warehoused information, which is broken down by books and parts (P&L 
component breakdowns/risk analysis tools), now has the visual aid of numerous 
bar graphs and pie charts used to represent the information listed above - 
provided to you at the touch of a button.  These charts are not only very 
easy to understand, but will be helpful in your daily work analyzing trading 
information.  

Now that all commodity groups are performing additional analysis and 
providing reports other than P&L and positions to both MRM RAC and commercial 
departments, the tools provided by ATHENA have been proven to be extremely 
useful.  

ATHENA makes analysis of the time trend of data an effortless process, as it 
has warehoused data for the past year for each commodity.

The rollout of ATHENA is currently underway, according to the following 
timeline:

? From now until Friday November 10th, access to the database is being given 
to the beta testers (testers already chosen).
? Monday November 13th - First instructional training class from 4-5pm. 
Conference room 3270.
? Thursday November 16th - Second instructional training class from 3-4pm.  
Conference room 3270.  
? Subsequent classes will be scheduled depending on need.
? Production users will have access to the database within the few weeks 
following November 16th.
  
Each of these sessions will hold up to 15 participants, and attendees are 
taken on a first come first serve basis.  Please contact Pamela Sonnier (ext. 
37531) to sign up for one of these training sessions.

We expect that all business controllers will want to have access to ATHENA. 
Additionally, there may be other employees in your group who need access.  
Please send all requests for access to ATHENA to Maria Teresa Aguilera-Peon 
(ext. 35257), Jennifer Nguyen (ext. 57590), or Eugenio Perez (ext. 35828) 

For further information on ATHENA, or to set up a one on one demonstration, 
call Eugenio Perez (X35828), Maria Teresa Peon (X35257) or Jennifer Nguyen 
(X57590).

Best regards and looking forward to working with you,

Shona

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the 
transparency and accountability of issues raised. 

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient' 
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin 
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the 
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from 
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get 
an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we 
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a 
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their 
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down 

Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns 
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems 
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues
Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate 
that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date. 
Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict 
systematically with the above instructions
All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls 
exist and function in NY
Marcelo / Me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business 
communications on roles and responsibilities
Myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and 
monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens

Will call later

the US press) and thought you might find it interesting in light of our 
inroads into Japan.

The presidents of Tokyo Power and Chubu Power announced that in the spring, 
they and eight other Japanese power companies would merge their 
telecommunications and Internet businesses into a new company.  This company 
seems to be based on a telecommunications joint venture (PNJ Communications) 
that they formed last year.  They are hoping to get 20% of their capital from 
the American company Qwest Communications International.

It is not strange to see Japanese companies cooperating with competitors.  
Joint ventures with Western companies are still rare, but less so recently, 
given the longevity of the economic malaise in Japan, and the severe 
profitability and balance sheet problems of some Japanese companies.  
Nevertheless, as far as I know, this is the first time that power companies 
have made such an effort.  In the past, they have generally maintained 
mutually respectful local monopolies.  I think that deregulation has them 
very worried.  I imagine that they will continue with this cooperation as 
they feel more and more threatened by excelr and other Western companies.

27947,beck-s/all_documents/999.,<384442.1075855768159.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Thanks for your comments on the standards.  Our approach in creating a global 
exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there.  Our 
initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical 
standards by the end of this year.  That will be a first, to on a daily basis 
have a view into the exceptions outside the global  standards.  Many of the 
measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the 
level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence 
of those that are managing these services.  Some of these may be more 
appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted 
within ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the 
wholesale merchant services companies.  Give me a call and we can set a time 
to get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with 
you.  

We spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations 
controllers reviewing and discussing these standards.  Shona has taken a stab 
at the format of these exception reports.  It is likely that we will have a 
rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of 
these reports, so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these 
reports.  

Yes, we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for 
these activities.  My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute, 
but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as 
needed to clear the exceptions.  It is invariably the deals that are 
exceptions in some way that create the problems.  For instance, small power 
deals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up.  These 
were ""on the side"" and not captured in total power exposure because they 
didn't have a book to put them in (a discovery during the doorstep review).  
If this goes on the exception report, then we can highjack someone in risk in 
Houston to help Calgary set up a new book, or get IT resources focused 
quickly on any solution that may require their input to fix.  By having a 
prescribed elevation of these exceptions, we should get the appropriate 
attention to correct them.  The spur for making sure that all exceptions are 
appropriately noted, will be that if there is a problem with any deal that 
was an exception (not in the books, no confirm, etc.) and was not included on 
the exception report, that this will be grounds for termination for the 
appropriate operations controller.  I will make sure that as we start this 
reporting process that this is well understood.  The other impetus will be 
that during doorstep reviews the operational activities will be gauged 
against these standards.  The AA internal audits should also access adherence 
to these.

Subject: Fundamental Operating Standards


This is the first time I have seen these - have they been rolled out ?

I would be interested to see the format of the exception reporting that 
attaches to these standards that you mentioned - did you have anything 
particular in mind ?

I had a few of my own ideas for some diagnostic measures of the extent to 
which these standards are being adhered to - see what you think:

Transactions are recorded accurately and timely (completeness, accuracy)

Daily report of ""holdovers"" by commodity group (trades not booked in time for 
daily cut - off, including counterparty, volume, price etc)
Report of P&L effect of booking errors as they transpire, including 
responsibility

Daily Management P&L and Position reporting is accurate and timely 
(completeness, accuracy)

Periodic qualitative review by RAC (i.e. Is it sufficient by reference to the 
Risk Management Policy - does it show delta gamma vega as a term structure 
etc....)

NB: the point about ""Reports issued on next day of trading at a commercially 
pre-determined time"" conflicts with the Risk Managemet Policy, which says 
""...before any subsequent trading ocurrs"". I think the diagnostic measure 
should be, for each commodity DPR a report daily of all those signed off as 
final (note I do not neccessarily mean ""officialized"") after the relevant 
market opening time (usuaully 7.30 am)

Timely confirmation and execution of transactions (completeness, accuracy, 
existence)

Monthly report of all unmatched confirmations:

- outstanding inward confirmations (i.e. sent out, not signed) 
- outstanding outward confirmations (i.e deal done, confirm not sent) 
- outstanding mismatched or disputed confirmations

showing deal trade date, start date, commodity, counterparty, MTM value, aged

Settlements with counterparties occurs accurately and timely (non CACS, non 
Dashed deals)

Monthly report of cumulative amounts of all unmatched or unapplied cash:

Unapplied cash by counterparty, in original denomination, including deal 
reference if any
Unmatched amounts by deal, where settled amount differs from maturing forward 
MTM value

One additional thing that ocurred to me was the fact that those responsible 
for supplying the information are also those responsible for the operation 
underlying it in some sense, so the obvious pitfalls of self - assessment 
will come into play here. Perhaps the ""pilot"" report should be put together 
somehow independently.

Views ?

As all of you know we are in the midst of the Fall recruitment process for 
the Analyst and Associate Program - the Super Saturday process.  A major part 
of the process is the Saturday interview which has been changed this year.  
Interviewers now only review five candidates and the ""offer "" decision is now 
completed on the same day as the interview.  This decision process is 
facilitated by a member of excelr's executive committee and should be 
completed by 3:30 pm.  ENA is one of the major users of the Analyst and 
Associate pool and needs to be well represented at Super Saturday (which we 
are not at this time).  The Program still needs additional interviewers and 
the Office of the Chairman of ENA needs you to support the Program and the 
interview process.  Signing up is now easier than ever and all you need to do 
is access the following web site and fill in a few blanks.  The web site is 
as follows:  http://axis.excelr.com/notice/ssinvite.asp.  The dates of Super 
Saturday's are listed below:  

     Associates:   Analysts:
     October 28   November 4
     November 11   November 18
     December 2   December 9
     December 15

The selection of qualified candidates is important to ENA  and excelr.  Your 
participation is needed, now especially for the October 28th and November 4th 
dates.  Please respond accordingly.

I received your voicemail this morning and I believe the following will 
answer all your questions:

1.  We are actually fine on Friday night dinners and really only need 
interviewers at this time.

2.  For the first weekend - Oct. 28th - To date, I don't see that anyone from 
your area has signed up to interview.  This may be because this is an 
Associate weekend.

3.  For the second weekend - Nov. 4th - The only person signed up is Pat 
Clynes from Logistics.  The second weekend is really large and we still need 
about 67 interviewers.  We are looking for Managers and above to interview.


4.  Attending schools  October 28th - approx. 55 students (Associate) 
    Georgetown
    Rice - Grad
    Michigan
    Thunderbird

    November 4th - approx. 100 students (Analyst)
    UT- Undergrad

Just want to provide a summary of our discussion on Wednesday, 4/19/2000 
regarding the analyst program and the conclusions reached.

Discussion item #1:  Similarities and differences between the commercial and 
commercial services analyst position.  Concluded that the only difference 
between the two analyst profiles is the difference in merit and bonus 
compensation.  Both have the opportunity to rotate across commercial and 
commercial services areas, return to business school after two years, stay 
and be promoted either to a commercial services professional position or take 
a commercial route and ultimately be promoted to associate.

Agreed:  There is one analyst program and we will immediately eliminate the 
compensation differences.  All analysts will receive the same 5K yearly merit 
increase and be eligible for the commercial bonus range.

Discussion item #2:  Morale of analysts in program.  Due largely to 
compensation differences making the program feel as though it is still two 
separate programs.  Commercial services needs more attention and focus.  Need 
someone of a Celeste Roberts calibre to focus on the staffing piece.

Agreed:  Eliminating the compensation differences will help boost morale.  
Additionally, there needs to be more focus and attention paid to the career 
development of analysts.  

Discussion item #3:  UT Spring recruiting.  Did not feel there were enough 
events and concerned that executive leads were not asked to participate.

Agreed:  Celeste Roberts will follow-up with George Hope and Shelly Jones to 
confirm number of events and whether dates were booked on executive lead's 
calendars.  Bottom line, we want to ensure that presence on campus is not 
minimized.

Discussion item #4:  Off-line discussion with Sally Beck regarding the 
Performance Review Process and whether all analysts would be reviewed as one 
pool

Agreed:   Per Sally Beck it was agreed that all analysts would be reviewed 
together.  We will not separate commercial from commercial services but will 
put all analysts on the table and review as one analyst pool.

 Please let me know if there are additional items that need to be captured.

Dolores Muzzy, Celeste Roberts' assistant was attempting to schedule a 
meeting to discuss the Commercial Services program.  The reason that Dolores 
is trying to schedule a meeting is follows:
(1)  Celeste and I were scheduled to speak briefly at Rick's staff meeting on 
Tuesday, April 11th as we had at Cliff Baxter's on March 27th.  However, we 
were not going to have a significant amount of time and because the 
discussion may have been extensive, Rick agreed that it made more sense to 
schedule a meeting in which the Commercial Services program was the sole 
topic of discussion.

(2) You and I had exchanged voice mails on March 27th, immediately after 
Cliff's staff meeting where you indicated that you had a group of individuals 
who were involved in recruiting and who would like to meet with us regarding 
questions about the management of the program.  You indicated that you would 
facilitate scheduling the meeting.  However, given that I had not heard from 
you and Celeste had told Rick we would schedule a meeting, it seemed to make 
sense to combine the meetings since they would most probably include some of 
the same individuals and cover the same questions.

I have no problem with you facilitating the scheduling of the meeting as you 
expressed to Dolores.  However, given that we told Rick that we would 
schedule a meeting, we are just trying to make sure that it does not slip 
through the cracks.  We will attempt to be available whenever it is 
convenient for you and the group that you wish to pull together.  If you wish 
to schedule a meeting immediately, our availability is as follows:

Friday, April 14th from 2:00 - 5:00 p.m.
Monday, April 17th from 9:30 - 11:30 a.m.
Tuesday, April 18th from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. or 2:30 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.

forward to meeting with you.

Jeff/Larry,

To follow up on my voicemail, the Associate and Analyst Program is in great 
need of interviewers for October 28th and November 4th Super Saturdays.  
These weekends are the most critical at this time.  To date, we are in need 
of an additional 38 interviewers for October 28th and 67 for November 4th.  
In order to have a successful recruiting season, we would greatly appreciate 
your assistance in getting more EGM executives to participate in this 
effort.  Please contact me at x39233 with any questions.  Thanks for your 
continued support.

I have personally called each of the 38 candidates to let them know they have 
been selected.  They will also receive a formal letter through the mail later 
this week.  This letter will include details regarding November 4.

Shin, and Xuemei Lang
1 Summer Internship offer: Chia-Lin Lee
2 Full Time Office Visits: Andrew Susman and Amanda Ostrander

The next step is cultivation.  I will assign candidates to targeted team 
members for telephone follow-up calls.  I would also like to have volunteers 
to go to Austin next week to take these candidates to dinner.  Please let me 
know if and when you will be available so that I can begin planning.

If you recall, several months ago we held a meeting to discuss the bonus 
planning needs for Commercial and Commercial Support Analysts now that they 
have been combined into one program under the A/A Program umbrella.

I was asked to put together some information on how bonuses in 1999 compared 
between Merchant Service Analysts, Commercial Analysts and Commercial Support 
Sr. Specialists (and possibly even Managers) so that we could determine if 
there would be a 2000 bonus compression problem in Analysts being placed in 
Commercial Support positions and then having lower bonuses.  Attached below 
you will find the results of that research.

In short the conclusions are these:
The 2000 system allows a difference between Commercial and Commercial Support 
Analyst bonus matrices preventing the compression problem.
In 1999, Commercial Analyst and Commercial Support Sr. Specialist bonus 
matrices were comparable - and this can still occur in 2000.
Bonus structures can easily be planned for 2000 so that no compression 
problem occurs.



The data above is being sent to help you understand the concepts we discussed 
and put closure to the meeting.  The 2000 bonus planning system allows for a 
variation within Analyst categories (commercial and commercial support) and 
will meet the business needs.  Please let me know if you want to discuss 
further or would like to see the raw data used in the research.

Beth,

The information we need to complete the analysis is included in the document 
we outlined this morning. Fred and Rahil are working on getting volumes for 
your group to estimate the marginal cost per transaction at different volume 
levels. We will use that information to estimate the cost side going forward. 
On the revenue side I believe that it can be misleading to use a cost plus 
approach and that we will be better off estimating the price counterparties 
are willing to pay for the service based on market comparables from the 
benchmarking studies Sally contracted a while ago. We will also take into 
account for pricing other variables as the contingent liability risks that 
they are avoiding by outsourcing their back office function and the issue of 
information confidentiality.

Subject: Deal models

We need to finalize the 4 models that have a high, low and expected case for 
our businesses.  They are CommodityLogic, DealBench, TransactionHub and 
Mid/Back Office.  DealBench should be built as an ASP as discussed, 
CommodityLogic as an ASP, TransactionHub as we have discussed and back office 
as you are working with Sally.      

We first need to agree on all the assumptions for revenue that lead to each 
case suggested above for each business.  We then need to agree on 5 to 10 
years of expenses so we can reach an operating margin we agree upon.  We then 
finally need to look at them and see what capital investment might be needed 
to go in to each one and then finally build a pretax income statement and 
pretax cash flow statement for each business.

The goal is to determine, within a range, the present value of each business, 
based on certain assumptions, and then to determine what they are worth as a 
company.

I know we are part way there on all of these initiatives, but I want this all 
finished as follows:

TransactionHub - Friday afternoon the 16th.

CommodityLogic - Tuesday afternoon the 19th

DealBench - Wednesday afternoon the 17th

Mid/Back Office - Friday the 23rd

Remember, we are trying to get a range that is approximately right that we 
can all believe.

Your thoughts?

excelr is sizing up the opportunity to offer internal back office processing=

Overview
Looked at spreadsheet for validation:

Ongoing:
Defining the size of the market:
? There may be three =01+levels=01, of markets for these services - one for=
 energy=20
risk mgt. ops (attack first), a larger market if we include global market=
=20
offerings, and yet a larger market if we think of our offering as transacti=

processing, ala ADP.
? There are a number of ways to derive the potential market size.  The=20
current spreadsheet identifies existing customers.  Some may be seeking our=
=20
services based on their current and projected deal volumes. =20
? Fred will continue to analyze the market size(s), adding customers outsid=
e=20
of current EOL spectrum.
? Fred will analyze the offerings and pricing structures used by competitor=
s.=20
? Sheri will get with internal data owners to (in)validate current=20
spreadsheet numbers and identify customers with high year-over-year increas=
es=20
in EOL transaction volume.

Expenses
? James will take a harder look at the expenses.  We wonder if number of=20
transactions is the best method to use.  What is the real cost driver?  Whe=
re=20
are the =01+breaking points=01,, or transaction levels where we must invest=
 further=20
to offer services to additional customers?

Strategy
? Beth Apollo will schedule a meeting with Beth Perlman, Jenny Rub, Rahil, =
et=20
al to discuss ongoing big picture.
? Beth will also schedule a meeting with Mark Taylor, to include Rahil and=

Dale.  They will discuss points on the service level agreement that we will=

various government officials.  I hope the result was good.

We all had a really helpful meeting here in Houston with those guys, and I

Mexico and work with Jaime and Agustin.  He is bi-lingual and very excited 
about the prospect.  We expect him to be proactive and help out quite a bit 
with setting up the new Mexico trading legal entity.   I have no doubt that 
this will fix most of the little issues that we discussed.  

We also assigned someone to come to Monterrey to set up Jaime and Agustin 
with system access where appropriate, and especially access to Livelink, our 
automated contract viewing system.  This should facilitate access to all 
Mexico contracts online (originals kept in Houston), and there should be no 
need to keep hard copies in Mexico.

The week of November 13 is the week of the excelr Management Conference in San 
Antonio.  It begins on Wednesday evening, so most people will be travelling 
on Wednesday afternoon.  I will be in the office on Monday and Tuesday that 
week, so those days work well for me for your visit.   I just wanted you to 
know about the conference in case that has an impact on other meetings that 
you might want to have in Houston that week.  Let me know.  I will look 
forward to seeing you and introducing you to others on the team.  

We are looking forward to seeing Mo next week here in Houston.  

Have a great weekend.  --Sally

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

Don't worry about me -- I just thought we should get things moving -- since 
now I have officially been replaced, and it has been announced to my direct 
reports here in London.   Fernley (not sure if you have spoken to him)  is 
anxious to put an announcement out to excelr Europe that Phillip Lord and I 
are leaving and that Melissa will be stepping in to replace us.
Since Phillip already has a place to go, it would be nice if we could at 
least say that I am going to North America Energy Ops, or something -- even 
if we don't have all of the details worked out.

I am not sure if you want me to come over and meet some of your commercial "" 
customers""  --- also  - I have never met Delainey (I don't think)  -- but 
maybe knowing Frevert well is enough.  I am planning to come in November 
(first half) to work on Europe's plan and coordinate with Brent, Wes and the 
other groups under Frevert, so maybe I can meet some people then.  Would love 
to discuss

Monday is fine -- as I am sure today will be another crazy day.

I know how all of those reviews are.  John Sherriff put a o5 per review per 
day penalty on any dept head who didn't have their reviews  done by August 
15th, and of course I was on holiday the week before that, so I had 2 days to 
do 10 reviews.

Hopefully I can help you with that direct report problem.

If I don't talk to you today, then have a good weekend,

Subject: Stuff

Crazy week -- 7:00 pm and I just finished a project for Delainey that I got 
at noon today.  Cancelled everything on the calendar and have been immersed 
ever since.  Patti gave me your message with your home number around 5:30 
today, just as she was leaving -- apologized for not giving it to me 
earlier.  However, given my immediate project, I don't think that I could 
have called until now.  And at 1:00am London time, I think that this e:mail 
is much better.  

I am still really crunched tomorrow morning.  All of our mid-year reviews 
must be completed by the time we have our ENA Office of the Chair staff 
meeting at 2:30 tomorrow.  Big push, after an over percentage completion rate 
of about 60% at our ENA meeting two weeks ago.  Some of those unfinished 
reviews were mine to give (16 direct reports is a killer).  I wrote three 
last night after Tyler went to bed, finished at 1:00 am and gave all three 
reviews this morning.  I have 5 more to write tonight, and to deliver 
tomorrow morning to be at 100%.  I will try to call you on my way into the 
office tomorrow morning from the car.  If I miss you then, it will be late 
afternoon Houston time before I could call you.  Next week shapes up to be 
MUCH better.  

I am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations.  Would love 
to have to over here and involved in operations.  So I will either catch you 
from my car tomorrow morning, or we can talk on Monday.

Hope you are well, and enjoyed the weekend.  It was much too short for us!!  

I was wondering what the next steps are in terms of formalizing the role that 
you and I discussed in San Antonio.

As Fernley gets closer and closer to nailing my replacement, I am feeling 
more and more exposed.

As much as Rick and others have told me not to worry, it would be nice to 
nail it down.

I really do think that I would benefit greatly from more of a middle office 
focus, and have the management skills to supervise a large team of people.  I 
know I would bring a new perspective to the role, coming from more of a back 
office focus, and after my European experience know how to focus on key 
controls.



Do I need to do anything?    I have discussed February departure timing with 
Fernley and he is fine with it.  Depending upon my replacement, it could be 
sooner.

I would need a few weeks to get things wrapped up in London like moving and 
packing etc.  and re-established in Houston  -- need to buy cars etc.

but otherwise there shouldn't be too much downtime between places.

Glad to discuss at any time  x830 6639

Subject: Fundamental Operating Standards

All,

As you may be aware there has been an effort, fostered in Houston by Beth 
Apollo, to draft a set of ""Fundamental Operating Standards"".  The object of 
these standards is to set out the best practices of the Global Counterparty 
group for all locations (Houston, Calgary, London, Southern Cone).

We are seeking your input to ensure that the Standards properly reflect a 
London GCP perspective.  We - Bill Hare, James Scribner and myself - have 
compiled a draft of the Standards which is attached below.



It's important to note that the Standards detail some procedures we have 
always carried out, and some that we are working towards.  The intention of 
setting Fundamental Operating Standards is to agree on and document common 
objectives for GCP.   With this in mind, we look forward to receiving your 
comments on and suggestions for the draft.

If you have any questions please phone me on the numbers below.

Greg and Rex,

Thanks for the input.  I will try to contact Beth Apollo.  

Here are a few points I think will help.  

? I also read the partnering agreement carefully and sent the revised copy to 
Travis McCullough this morning
? At this time I believe our risk is quite low, as we are not officially part 
of the bid yet
? I will work very hard to keep everyone informed

The following points protect excelr from significant risk:

  1)  We were quite careful about what we sent to CSG (reviewed by Beth, 
David, Rahul and myself)
  2)  We did not quote any price for software or services
  3) The original RFP asked for a custom solution, which CGI is proposing. We 
do not participate in this work.
  4) The option to take a different approach (e.g. leverage existing software 
from a partner) is being proposed by CSG as an alternative approach, but is 
not priced.  The option would be explored during a ""make versus buy"" analysis 
within CSG's methodology (during the initial requirements and design phase).  
This gives us time to clarify our plans.

I hope these points might mitigate any concerns over the rapid time frame of 
the proposal.  As the proposal is due on Monday, I am not sure if there is 
time to engage a large number of reviewers, but I will ask CSG to copy Rahul 
and hopefully he can get appropriate input.

- Steve

A brief update:

I spoke with the proposal leads at CGI (Greg Felton and Company) this 
morning, and all appears to be on schedule.

? Greg communicated our joint approach to the client and they are very 
interested
? Greg received excelr's materials and they are more than sufficient for our 
current proposal needs
? I received a draft of CGI's proposed teaming agreement.  I made made edits 
according to my knowledge of excelr's legal policies.  I will forward the 
document to legal if CGI accepts the changes
? Greg will complete CGI's initial proposal and forward the draft to excelr, 
for review, this weekend and on Monday
? The proposal is due Monday PM to CMS
? Presentations to CMS by potential vendors will occur on March 26th-28th.  
We should think about who attends and at what point we might want to use our 
internal contacts to approach the client.  For now we are waiting, based on 
CGI's advice.
? Since the client is in the requirements phase, we should think about how we 
might want to support that process, given our approach to delivering systems 
solutions

Thanks for everyone's support.

Larry,

The ENA Accounting groups have had wires for our NYMEX and OTC margin calls 
sent back due to improper signatures.  The timely flow of these monies is a 
vital component to our trading organization.  I believe that these two items 
fall under category ""B"" of the policy memo that was distributed (see email 
below) and therefore should only require the signature of an Accounting 
Director.

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

We have a contractual obligation to our brokers and OTC counterparties to 
provide margin according to the guidelines set forth in our agreements with 
them.  These margin calls / returns of margin are monitored and amounts 
signed off on by the RAC Credit Group (Bill Bradford's area).   Backup from 
the Credit group should  be and is included with each wire.

I would appreciate your consideration of the above arguments to facilitate 
the movement of these monies on a go-forward basis.  I will call you tomorrow 
to discuss the possibility of having this change in effect for Monday Dec.

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a ""Workflow"" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a ""Workflow"" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

Subject: Notes on ASE Studio

Hello Mary- 

Here is a rough strating point of the ASE Studio planning document.  I have 
included the objectives we discussed initially - we will continue to refine 
them as we move forward.  

Also, I inserted the notes I made during the offsite on Friday.  My notes 
were primarily focused on information that the participants were wanting or 
that I thought might be useful.  Also, I jotted down quite a few questions 
that came up during the session.  Some of them were addressed on Friday and 
others were not.  We do not necessarily need to address all of these at the 
ASE - and I would suspect there are others that should be addressed but are 
not listed here.  I'm sending this information in advance for your review and 
thought.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss, please let me know.

Please don't distribute the agenda or share it with the session 
participants.  I'm sure they are starting to ask the question - ""So, what are 
we going to do while we're there?"" - in fact I've had folks ask me that 
already.  My typical response is to reiterate the goals of the session and 
explain that we will do a series of exercies in both large and small group 
formats.  And, when they continue to press for more (as I've found they 
typically do) - I politely let them know that more details will be shared 
when we kick off the session on Monday morning.  Now, if they are curious 
about what an ASE is and why they have to go to Dallas for it, you can cover 
that too or have them call me.

night after we wrap up for the day.  We will arrange transportation from the 
ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.  Currently,

With all our reporting changing to London Office and now it appears some 
restructure of risk and the broadening of Sally's role, what are we going to 
do for the second report for our new risk manager, Justin Den Hertog - he has 
taken over from Alan.

He reports to me locally, but functionally he would traditionally have 
reported to you on behalf of Sally's area. I assume this has now moved with 
the rest of us and would therefore be either James New or Mike Jordan in

responsibility for trading activity.

Paul's appointment is in recognition of the critical role Paul has played in 
excelr Australia's successful commencement and the body of outstanding work he 
has accumulated to date in his career with excelr. It is worth noting that 
Paul joined excelr as recently as the Associate intake of 1995.  In the short

Thanks, Bjorn.

A few weeks back, Sydney started executing their own Confirms, where in the 
past, it had been done in Houston by myself.   Since I have not heard of this 
from Houston, I would not be doing my job if I let this go unquestioned.  I 
assume this is a policy change?

They are also making advances towards becoming an Asian hub.   As such, there 
are a few responsibilities that I currently handle, which Sydney is looking 
to take over:
 - Houston independently reconciles the broker statements daily;   the 
Settlements Clerk could handle;
 - All settlements are approved by me in Houston;  the new Settlements Clerk 
could handle this as well, or someone 
   in Houston could signoff on payment before Treasury takes action.

I guess I'm looking for assurances that Sydney is supposed to become a hub, 
and some information on exactly how autonomous they should become.   Are they 
to be completely independent, or are there to be a minimum level of controls 
between offices?

Thank you for taking the time to see me when I was in Houston, and for lunch. 

I am working on a detailed comprehensive plan of action to enact the changes 
we discussed re the settlement and confirmations procedures transfer. Due to 
the volume of work that was on my desk upon my return this is not coming 
together quite as quickly as I would like and therefore we are going to have 
to look at it piece by piece. 

We need to issue a new authorised signatory list this week for excelr 
Australia Energy and excelr Australia Finance Pty Ltd due to changes in the 
dealer structure and therefore we have decided that this would be a good 
opportunity to make the change to the approval of confirmations. 

As agreed, we will have Sydney office take over responsibility for signing 
all confirmations. This means they are still prepared in Sydney, as they are 
now, with the change of procedure being that they will now be signed in 
Sydney and faxed from here to our clients. The primary signatories will be 
the Managing Director (Paul Quilkey) or the Chief Financial Officer (Heidi 
Mason). In the event of both being unavailable they will be signed by the 
Senior Legal Counsel (David Minns). 

The confirmation log will be maintained in its entirety by Sydney Office and 
will be held in a directory accessible by Houston. This will allow 
independent audit review to occur as required. 

In order to implement this change we have prepared a new authorised 
signatories list which we are planning to distribute at the end of this week. 
In the meantime could you please advise of what action needs to be taken in 
Houston to ensure all the relevant areas are advised. Clearly a  key 
individual will be Sue Frusco. When I met with Sue in Houston we discussed 
briefly the fact that you and I had agreed that invoicing and confirmations 
would move to Sydney but at that stage there was no timing raised. Sue seemed 
happy to stay with the current arrangements until such time as we implemented 
a change. Do you want me to advise Sue or will someone from Houston speak to 
her?

While I think it is reasonable for you to request an increase to your limits, 
as you may know, the Board doesn't meet until May 2.  It would be somewhat 
unprecedented to leave a ""proprietary"" position over the limit for that 
length of time, i.e., the Australian Electricity book would far exceed the 
number of position limit violations for any other commodities.  I have left a 
message for Greg and will speak to Rick Buy today.  In the meantime, I 
suggest that you put together a request for approval to increase your limits 
to be presented at the first opportunity.

Subject: Accounting for transaction done with Bridgeline

Steve,

AA has indicated that our proposal with regard to transactions done between 
ENA and Bridgeline sounds OK.  They did bring up a good point about how the 
40% would be shown for purposes of position and loss limits, which under our 
scenario of just using schedule 'C' to defer the 40%  we would effectively be 
showing the 100% for all other measures.  I told them that we would monitor 
for materiality before putting a manual process in place.

I think we should now meet with the commercial folks to explain the real p\l 
impact.  Would you take the lead on deciding who that should be and get a 
meeting set up?

Thanks

discussed with AA (Sorrells, Grutzmacher and Brown) how the monthly BRM 
controller's meeting deliverables and database deliverables should be 
prepared.  The proposal I think we should recommend to AA is the following:

Opening and closing meeting with front line managers and discussion of all 
items, regardless of priority ratings (high, medium, low)
Report generated to the Business Risk Managers at the monthly controller 
meeting in the ""Project Doorstep"" style, incorporating existing controls and 
observations/action steps to be taken on the critical issues (those with a 
high rating) and identify responsible person(s) and target date
Follow up matrix report relating to the specific project audited in the 
manner consistent with the BRM database indicating priority ratings (the high 
issues should match the issues reported in the monthly controller meetings)
Eliminate the summary report that has typically be presented at the monthly 
controller meetings

Once the ""Project Doorstep"" style report presented by  AA is received at the 
monthly controller meeting, compliance will input the issues into the second 
database to enable the reminder notifications to be sent to the person(s) 
responsible for the action step.  In addition, a monthly progress report will 
be generated from compliance to the Business Risk Managers to show the 
critical (high) issues and implementation detail, if any.

It will be imperative that AA issue final reports on the projects immediately 
after they have been completed and deliver the matrix  within two (2) weeks 
after the monthly controller meetings to Compliance for inputting to the BRM 
database.  If this information is not received within the two week time 
period, compliance will notify the BRM's and AA of the deficiency.

It will also be necessary for you, the Business Risk Managers, to notify your 
front line personnel that they will be receiving the email notifications on 
action plans with specific target dates and with the expectation that the 
responsible persons will be expected to respond to the email with the status 
report of the issue.

If you are in agreement with this reporting plan, please indicate so in a 
return email message to me and I will coordinate all responses and 
communicate this to AA.  I feel that this process will provide the BRM's the 
necessary information that you have indicated you want to hear in the 
controller's meetings, including the candid discussions as well as provide 
compliance with the necessary information to maintain the database so the 
information is available for the corporate needs.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 31939. Thank 
you for your attention.  Donna Lowry",Non Abusive

at the Crown Plaza Hotel, 2222 West Loop South.  This is an important next 
step in completing the SAP implementation and achieving the benefits that we 
identified before Project Apollo and Beyond began. 

The objectives of this meeting will be 1) to identify management's 
information needs and priorities related to the accounting and reporting 
processes and 2) to prioritize and focus the efforts of the Process 
Leveraging and Reporting teams based on management's needs and priorities.  
Therefore, it is very important for you to attend, to ensure that your BU's 
needs and priorities are considered in these projects.  I realize that this 
is a very busy time, but it will probably continue to be busy through yearend 
close.  If we can get started as soon as possible, it is my hope that we can 
complete the projects and see the results soon, possibly by the January close.

Attached is a list of questions and other information that you should 
assemble and bring with you to the meeting so that we can make 
better-informed decisions.  We will collect your completed information sheets 
to use for further analysis and follow-up after the meeting.  If you have

ISSUE

The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure=20
(OBSF) pre year-end to meet excelr requirements for gearing ratios.

Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being=
=20
bearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value o=
f=20
which depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given t=
he=20
hard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially=
=20
took place on spreadsheets.

The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business=20
should not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on=20
balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement=
s,=20
particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in=
=20
the AS400. With the specified functionality it is believed that all=20
operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed=20
satisfactorily.

The core functionality, which was due prior to the year-end, was released=
=20
during January but was subsequently found to have introduced =01+bugs=01, t=
o the=20
integrated business control processes. Whilst an improvement on having no=
=20
OBSF functionality, the =01+bugs=01, have had an increasingly negative effe=
ct on=20
the control environment, compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a=
=20
guaranteed delivery for the =01+bug=01, fixes and non core =01,reporting=01=
,=20
functionality.

This has given rise to the following concerns:

? There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at =
a=20
brand & location level to coordination records (the global position is=20
reconciled however).
? It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM&CL as:
? a) P&L on spread moves from Cash to 3 months positions (and related cash =
to=20
3 months provisions) can not be produced by the system and must be estimate=
d,=20
and
? b) System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values.

These concerns are compounded by the following:

? The most experienced AS400 IT developer for the EM&CL business has=20
resigned. He is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in=
=20
July 2001.
? The most experienced AS400 IT developer on the EML side of the business h=
as=20
also resigned. He left in January 2001.=20
? There is no documentation for the AS400. It is therefore difficult for=20
experienced AS400 programmers to get upto speed on the system.

Conclusion

It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the=20
AS400 system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays. The=

current situation has arisen due to non-delivery of IT developments and tig=

extremely supportive about the idea of contributing in a coordinated manner=
=20
to the McCombs School.  This was evidenced by an expression of intent in=20
giving totaling about $175,000 from just the 14 people!

Here is what we propose and how it would work.

1. The UT Alumni at excelr would pledge $1 million over four years to the=20
McCombs School.  This would consist of $500,000 of gifts from employees and=
 a=20
matching $500,000 from excelr.

2. The matching program provided through the McCombs gift to the Business=
=20
School would match the $1 million.

3. The result would be a permanently endowed $2 million =01&excelr Chair=018=
 to=20
support =01&star quality=018 faculty for the school.  This will represent o=
ne of=20
the largest Faculty Chairs at the Business School.

A few additional details:

1. Each individual=01,s contribution will also be credited to their name (a=
long=20
with the excelr match) for recognition purposes in Business School=01,s Annu=
al=20
Report, President=01,s Associates, etc.  In other words, a $10,000 contribu=
tion=20
matched by excelr will be considered as a $20,000 contribution by that=20
individual for recognition purposes.

2. excelr has agreed to not count it=01,s match against an employee=01,s ann=
ual=20
matching gift limitation of $15,000, as long as the gift is coordinated in =
a=20
way that makes it a part of the =01&excelr Chair=018.

3. The gift may also be counted toward any previous pledge made to the =01&=
We=01,re=20
Texas=018 campaign as long as that pledge is not supporting a separately na=
med=20
contribution.  Please let us know that this is your intent.

Please carefully consider this request.  I do not plan to finalize the pled=

until I receive responses from enough officers to support this contribution=

We have about 40 officers of excelr who are UT alumni and with some=20

Lexi Elliot,

Hi, my name is Judd Eisenberg, and I am a business student at the
University of Texas who is seeking the summer analyst internship at excelr.
I received an opportunity to meet you at a reception dinner that excelr
hosted last semester in Austin.  I have always been intrigued with the
analyst and associate rotational programs that excelr offers.  The courses I
take in school, accounting and particularly finance, my extensive job
experience, and my leadership positions have provided me with valuable
skills for the summer analyst position.  I have a good friend at UT who
will start working full-time for excelr in the IT division in a few months,
and I know he is truly looking forward to the challenges and opportunities
that excelr provides.  Because I am currently interning with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Houston, I am not able to go through the
recruiting process at the university.  I am sending an attachment of my
resume in this e-mail since I am going to be in Houston until mid-March.
Please e-mail me if there are any openings for the position I am seeking or
if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Judd Eisenberg

Lynett and Cindy:

Greetings from Houston!

I have a special request for you.  In order for us to prepare our campus
recruiting strategy for next fall, I need information regarding
internship
recruiting.

As you know, we decided to concentrate our spring 2001 effort on intern
recruiting and interviewing.  In order for us to ensure that we are
being
effective with this strategy, I need to know which companies interviewed
for summer interns during the fall 2000 recruiting season.  Companies of
particular interest would be El Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Duke, consulting
firms such as McKinsey, and Big 5 accounting firms.

By providing this information, you would greatly assist our effort for
upcoming years.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Lexi Elliott

fundraising effort underway.  As a part of that effort, the Red McCombs 
School of Business is trying to raise $130 million which will help it to 
achieve its goal to become the next great business school in the world.  
Obviously, the Red McCombs gift of $50 million (the largest ever contributed 
to the University) is a big part of that effort.  However, much more is 
needed and will only be achieved through participation by a significant 
number of alumni and friends of the University.

On Tuesday, February 6th at 2 pm, Dean Bob May of the McCombs School will be 
at the excelr Building to meet with us about the School's plans and how we can 
participate.  I am organizing this meeting for Bob and inviting all excelr 
officers that are UT alumni.  This should be a very informal meeting with 
relatively few attendees (hopefully around 25 people).  It will give you a 
chance to get to know Bob, what is going on at the Business School and how 
you can participate. Make no mistake.  We hope the result is that you decide 
to support the effort.  There is a unique opportunity to participate at this 
time because, in addition to matching funds from excelr, the McCombs gift 
provides for additional matching funds for contributions of a certain level.  
I have found that this matching provides a real opportunity to make endowment 
level gifts.

excelr and the McCombs School have a great partnership.  The company has made 
a significant commitment to the school's programs, we have a very significant 
presence on campus through our activities and support from administration and 
faculty, and we have enjoyed great success recruiting for a number of years.  
However, excelr has never successfully organized its alumni giving in a way 
which would allow for even greater excelr support and presence while 
optimizing each individual's contribution.  I am hopeful that as a group of 
excelr officers, we can set the example of coordinated giving.

Please plan to attend the meeting.  It will be held in the Board Room on 50,

(the outside part of a cardboard box) with Con Agra (13,500 tons and about 
$6,000,000 notional).  We hope to do another trade today with Irving as well.

are past the major issues.

Going forward (next two to three weeks), we will be working to get the 
product offering from its current 21 financial to about 50 financial as well 
as adding in physical at Rotterdam.  We will also be ready to handle any 
newsprint from Garden State at the end of August.  We also have some text 
changes and minor programming related to  wording on the site that is new or 
unclear to the industry.

We will continue to push for registration (currently at 12 who now have user 
ID, password and made it through credit, legal, tax).

The markets load in about 4 seconds now so we fixed the slowness issue.

We will also start generating a report each day on stats that are relevant.

I will try to get some read only IDs for people but give me a little time to 
get this done.  I want my tech people sitting with the traders this week 
showing them the system and making sure everything is working. They also need 
to go back through what they did the last month and make sure they clean up

   As long as our business model is a one to many model the decision is......
a. For Click Match activity Clickpaper.com can still be used as planned.  
Simply, we'll only be invoicing for transaction fees.
b. For Click Trade activity the following will happen.
 1.  Physical trading that occurs at any North American Hub developed by 
Clickpaper.com, excelr North America, Corp. (ENA) will be the        
confirming entity.  I  have asked legal to develop a simple recital statement 
for the physical confirmation to indicate that the transaction originated as 
a         ""Clickpaper.com on-line transaction"".   
 2.  Physical trading that occurs at any Hub developed for the U.K., Latin 
America, or Asia, has not yet been finalized for legal entity purposes.  My 
desire is       that we follow the legal entity structure used by EOL on-line 
trading for Hubs in similar countries.  We'll work that out soon.

Strictly from an operational point of view the benefits are many but the most 
significant is a much simplified mid/back-office effort in order to support 
Clickpaper on-line business.  We no longer need to be concerned about setting 
up more portfolio/book i.d.'s for risk books as on-line deals can go into the 
same risk books used today for pulp and paper.  Intercompany transactions 
between Clickpaper.com and ENA are now eliminated for on-line trades which 
simplifies the confirmation support as well as the downstream financial 
reporting/reconcilation activity that would be required by using 
Clickpaper.com as the entity.  

If our one to many model is successful, we move to a many to many model.  At

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we 
discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we 
had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta 
Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle 
Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for 
Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today 
during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems 
with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I 
talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said 
that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We 
plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to 
introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos 
for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to 
postponed further.

We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were 
comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need

Subject: Working together on the valuation model

All,

As we go forward on the next revision of the valuation model (due late next 
week or early the next for the offsite), it is important that we all 
understand and embrace some basic ground rules.  I've got some suggestions 
below and would like to hear any that you have:

In order to maintain coordination and control of the information - for the 
betterment of us all - I think we ought to give one person version control 
responsibility over the model.  This person should be advised when the model 
is updated.  Relating things like the effects on the valuation and reasons 
for the updating also seem pertinent.  Version control is critical if we are 
to maintain consistency in our approach to upper management.  

Related to this, Rahil should be made aware when the model is distributed to 
upper management (both Sally and Greg) and be given the opportunity to give 
feedback before hand.  

Just basic stuff, but if we can all agree to maintain this protocol before we 
go much further, we should be able to avoid any unnecessary complications.

Thanks,

Fred

Jafry,

Here is the actual presentation requirements as per the RFP.  We can deviate
from the form, but must address their stated requirements.  I think we
should structure the excelr portion as follows:

I.    ENW Overview
II.   Products and Services
III.  Engagement Approach

Let me know what you think.  We need to pull this together today.

I've also attached the material Steve sent me previously.

This is what CGI forwarded me this morning with regards to a potential 
partnering agreement with excelr to respond to the RFP sent out for 
development of Back-Office systems.  The idea is for us to license our 
""source-code' for the mid/back-office technology to CGI, who will then tweak 
it to build a system for their customers.  At this point in time, we have not 
made any commitments, whatsoever, and are planning to do so only if this can 
be done with minimal hand-holding from us (given our other project 
commitments).

Please read through the Teaming Agreement at your earliest so we can all 
discuss any revisions you may want made.

As CGI will be responding to this RFP today with potential support from ENW 
(i.e. our code would be one of the key selling points), they had requested 
some basic information on excelr, which we provided to them late last week.  
This will be bundled with company specific information for CGI, that will be 
provided as part of the Response to RFP.




Beth, I've also left a message for you with Blanca.  Lets talk when you get a 
chance so we can discuss this and other things sometime today.

Greg,

Two quick comments.  Mutual non-solicitation agreement will not be
accepted by excelr.  It is corporate policy not to enter into these
agreements because they are unenforceable internally (we are just too
large and recruit too many people to track them).  Certainly, we will
not use the partnership to recruit your people, but can not commit to
that in writing.

  Second, the term of the confidentiality agreement is quite long (3
years).  In the high tech world this is considered a quite long.  I
think our attorneys like to keep these shorter (again for tracking
purposes).  If we can make it 2 years and remove the mutual
non-solicitation, I will forward it.

Kathryn has done a good job of keeping me in the loop on this.  In addition, Kim has consistently provided useful, objective feedback, as shown in the memo attached below. 

We will produce a stable code with the changes Kim and her team have requested before the package is released outside the building.

I have also asked Kathryn to perform more testing within the CL team before asking Kim and her team (or any other clients) to play with the changes.  Performing significant changes overnight, and then showing the code to clients the next morning is wonderfully responsive, but a little too risky.

The high-level demo scheduled for Thursday will show code that is already frozen and hardened.

Subject:	Update on ConfirmLogic

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further.

We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.

Overall, we like the ""new"" streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.

Call with any questions.

 I just wanted to give a status report of my meeting with Louise Kitchen 
yesterday. Four main issues were of Confirm Central were discussed: legal 
loose ends and ramifications, user interface, functionality, and future 
enhancements.

 Starting with the legal aspect Louise wanted Mark Taylor brought into the 
process. She felt his experience from EOL would be useful, and would help 
make any seams between EOL and CL disappear. I am setting up ameeting for 
early next week between Mark T., Mark G., and Alan to get this process 
rolling.
 
 The user interface Louise thought needed some work she definitely did not 
like the colors of the website. She had good comments on how to improve the 
look and feel. We will try to incorporate Louise's suggestions as quickly as 
possible. I am not to concerned about these comments since we have spent the 
last 4 weeks developing functionality and have not yet focused on this issue.

 Louise was happy with the actual functionality of the site. She actually 
said we did an excellent job.
 
 Finally, on future relases she wanted us to focus on Financial & Physical 
Power, Financial & Physiacl Gas in the U.S. She felt that this is a market 
where we could make money, where excelr has enough volume that we could really 
relieve some pain on our counterparties. Other commodities such as Liquids, 
Global Products, Metals, she felt either did not have enough voume to justify 
the business model or would take to long to integrate into CL. As far as 
additional features to the site incorpoating an importing function for CP 
data was high on the list, next was reporting confirmation statistics, 
exporting data, and finally automatching.

Take away message from the meeting was that Louise was extremely happy with 
the site and our progress to date.

I'd like to set up a meeting with you regarding CommodityLogic's credit 
exposure tracker.

We are displaying what we call the ""exposure tracker"" on our site, which will 
provide two benefits:  revenue enhancement by providing incentive to visit 
the site every day, and control mechanism to automatically turn off early- 
and pre-pay options if a counterparty exposure reaches unfavorable levels.  

Credit has expressed concern that our numbers will not be completely 
accurate.  We need your help in evaluating:

1) the accuracy of the numbers displayed
2) how to improve such accuracy if it is not sufficient, whether in credit or 
in the back office

FIX in parallel with existing systems for December 2000, and then using FIX 
""under fire"" for January 2001 invoices.

The demo uses actual data from Sempra, our largest volume natgas financial 
counterparty.  In about a minute, FIX is able to compare excelr data and 
Sempra data (received electronically as an excel spreadsheet and stored on a 
mini version of our Deal Database), immediately matching about 1450 of the 
1500 deals.  It then helps the user to manually match those 50 deals that the 
primary match engine could not.  This whole process, if it were purely 
manual, would take more than a day.  Using excel spreadsheets (and sort 
functions), excelr currently spends 4 to 8 hours per month matching Sempra 
invoices. FIX allows the user to perform all matching in about 10 minutes.

Our next deliverable is the Confirm Central module v1.0, due 1 December.  We 
anticipate delivering it on time, as we have with FIX.

Subject: CommodityLogic IT Support

I hate to sound like a broken record, but our lack of IT support has now 
reached a critical point.  We need to begin work immediately on legacy system 
integration--basically modifying our existing systems (Unify, Sitara, 
Enpower,...) to generate first columnar and then (hopefully) XML data 
output.  This work is most appropriately done by the people who best know 
these systems, our IT group.

The development of the three modules is proceeding well.  We have designed 
the architecture to allow limited-capability versions of all three by the end 
of this year.  The key critical path item remains legacy system integration.  
The key step towards integration is the appointment of a senior IT person on 
our team.  Please let me know what I can do to help in this regard.

All the best,

Tom

Inja,

Per the conference call today I am confident that we can add value to the
Commodity Logic Project. I base this on the success of excelr Online and
Valtech's role of supporting that effort. Currently, We have the Architect
(David Jayakaran) that designed the presentation framework for EOL available
as part of the team. I mention this because of the obvious synergy between
the EOL framework and Commodity Logic. As discussed David will meet with you
on Wednesday. The action items I owe you are the excelr negotiated rate
structure and profiles for consultants that could start immediately. The
daily rates are senior consultants at $2,000 and consultants at $1,750.  The
profiles are attached for your review. Please contact me if you have any
questions.

Dan and Tom,
As we discussed, I am aggressively seeking well qualified top talent 
permanent and contract personnel for both Commodity Logic and Deal Bench.  We 
have specified our requirement for specialized technical experience 
(WebLogic, Java, JSP, HTML) and we are receiving many promising resumes in 
response.  We talked with Andersen Consulting, PriceWarterhouse, Enform, 
Valtech, Common Vision, Delinea, etc. and we made it clear that we want them 
to augment our permanent staff rather than doing a turn-key operation to 
which they have all agreed.

Attached are some of the preliminary resumes and fee schedules from EnFORM, 
we expect many others to be in approximately same range of rates.  If you 
have any questions, please let me know.

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further.

We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.

Overall, we like the ""new"" streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.

Call with any questions.

Further to our conversation, here are some of the things I thought of while 
speaking with Tom Gros. There are definitely some challenges we have to 
overcome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic.com as successful as 
excelrOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara.

I won't repeat thoughts about how we split CL from excelr, but let's put 
ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a 
potential solution. Well, that's an easy decision, somebody else is doing the 
hard work, and not charging us very much for it. So sign-up, but don't rely 
on anything until we see everything working.

Handling counterparties not using the system
The challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the 
Hub is wonderful, but until everybody is using the Hub, we have to keep other 
procedures and systems going, which stretches resources, Development, IT 
Support and user. This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero - the 
concept is wonderful, but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone 
else one trades with using the system. This is classic Chicken and Egg. Tom 
has a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this. This is taking us 
closer to an outsource-to-Andersen-consulting model which is certainly 
achievable, although not quite such an easy sell.

How much resource is left
The latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people, who 
are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving 
onwards. How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL, and 
then review what is left in the remaining environment. Does it mean we hold 
off doing anything? If we do then increasing volume means that we might end 
up incurring costs for massive numbers of people! We should go through 
costing for ""What happens if we completely stop development of X project?"". 
If that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else 
comes along then it may be cheaper than developing, but I hope in most cases 
it is not!

Start small to prove concept
E.g. first application in April 2001 only covers 20 fields
This is excellent, and we needn't shout it too loud to investors in CL, but 
for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be 
years before we can switch off many internal systems.
We might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 
years out?

Include European aspects from the beginning
This really isn't very difficult so long as one has some long-on-common-sense 
Europeans (not just Brits) involved in both specification and development 
from the beginning, but an as example of how not to do it, look at EnPower 
which took a year to allow just for currencies etc!

80-20 rule for types of transaction
EOL has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first.
Once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting (DTL) and risk 
(RisktRAC?) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on STP, 
and yet-to-become-vanilla products on explicitly different, manual 
approaches. Until that time, we have a strong desire to include as many 
different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system, which 
makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly (Think of 
certain deals in Power99 which are approximations of the actual deals, and 
manually tweaked every so often)

Testing
Tom's first thought is that we could leverage initial users (who would not 
pay) to do much of the testing.
EOL clearly got its testing done, but other experience shows that in order to 
have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different 
phases - component, system, integration, end-to-end, and then user-acceptance.
EOL saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many 
external users early in the process. It did have massive 
resource-commandability and so obtained input from many traders. Do the 
Support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the 
same sort of user attention? Given how often I hear ""short people"", that 
strikes me as something which in London would require significant additional 
resource, even after MG is absorbed.

What else did you come up with?

Tom,

Per our conversation a week or so ago, I am forwarding a file to you which 
provides the hours worked during the month of May for each activity performed 
in the confirmation process.  These hours are for multiple RC's across the 
various functions that are in Energy Operations.  The hours are provided by 
the people responsible for the RC's; however, in many cases are rough 
estimates.  The data provided is directionally correct.

The excel file attached has several tabs.  When you open the file you should 
at the confirmation tab.

If you have any questions, need any clarification or would like to set up a 
time for us to walk you through the information, please call me at ext. 39641 
or Shari Mao at ext. 33859.

on activities per RC.  I've only created custom views for Risk Management, 
Confirmations, and Settlements (VM and LO are gas specific, and the other

Early on, we had asked that CommodityLogic  target companies like AEP and Mirant for ConfirmLogic.  Kathryn mentioned that they were also thinking of talking to El Paso.

Tom called me yesterday and asked for a contact name at El Paso.  I told him about my planned lunch with Mirant as well.  He asked me to get a contact name for Mirant as well.  

I received some information from Mirant today that actually helps our case for ConfirmLogic.  They informed me that they have just visited with AEP regarding deals transacted on the Intercontinental Power Exchange (ICE) platform (Mirant is a stakeholder in that trading platform).  AEP wants to eliminate confirmations for trades on that platform and want the Automatch function.  He said that AEP's IT dept. is ready to take that step.  He also made the comment that Mirant's IT dept. is very lacking and is not ready to perform the automatch function.  He did say that they would be receptive to verifying the deal information electronically and eliminating the confirmations. He felt that technology wise, they were 3 years behind where we are.   

Our advantage is that we want to automatch the entire universe of deals (Broker, EOL, Direct trades, trades done on other platforms (i.e. Dynegy Direct, ICE, etc.)) rather than just a subset of deals (i.e. Trades done on ICE as AEP suggested).

Just want to pass this on to you to see if you had any concerns about providing this information to Tom.  I was planning on sending him an email tomorrow to give him the contact information.  Let me know.

CommodityLogic's financial management module is offering an ""exposure

deparment has raised issues on the accuracy of the data this feature will 
display and has suggested we meet with you and your group to discuss how we 
can ensure we have good data.   Apparently, they have to do a lot of manual

lots of counterparties.

I have also asked Kathryn to perform more testing within the CL team before 
asking Kim and her team (or any other clients) to play with the changes.  
Performing significant changes overnight, and then showing the code to

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we 
discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we 
had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta 
Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle 
Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for 
Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today 
during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems 
with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I 
talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said 
that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We 
plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to 
introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos 
for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to 
postponed further.

We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were 
comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need 
consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.

Overall, we like the ""new"" streamlined version of the screens and feel that 
it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.

Call with any questions.

Subject: Upcoming Compensation Analysis


To All Energy Operations Directors:

My name is Todd Burke and I'm a Compensation Specialist with ENA Human 
Resources (see attached bio).  As you know, Sally Beck has requested that I 
conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current pay arrangements for all 
Energy Operations staff.  The purpose of this analysis will be to ensure that 
the department's current pay arrangements are in line with the competitive 
marketplace.  Each component of pay will be examined individually and within 
the context of excelr's compensation philosophy (e.g., base salary, bonus, 
long-term incentives and total compensation).

The process will begin with a series of interviews which will be conducted in 
two stages:  

Stage 1-Data Gathering:  the focus of this stage will be upon gathering data 
around your perceptions of your group's current pay arrangements and give you 
the opportunity to address any of the internal and external inequities you 
perceive to exist.  

Stage 2-Job Matching:  the focus of this stage will be on job matching - we 
will establish a mutually agreed upon time to meet and discuss which 
positions in our salary surveys most accurately reflect the roles and 
responsibilities of your staff.  We will not be able to match 100 percent of 
your jobs to the jobs contained in the salary surveys.  Non-benchmark jobs 
will be reviewed using a job ""slotting"" approach.

To help facilitate the matching process, I will be assembling handouts 
containing the job descriptions taken from the relevant salary surveys which 
I will send to each of you in advance of our Stage 2 meeting.  The intent 
here is to give you the opportunity to ""pre-match"" your respective jobs 
thereby minimizing the time required to achieve this objective during our 
Stage 2 meeting.  It will be critical that you are comfortable with the 
matches that you agree to as these matches will be used when gathering 
relevant market data.  The data will only be as good as the matches.

Following the conclusion of Stage 2, I can begin gathering the market data 
based on the results of the job matching exercise and prepare a comparative 
analysis that I will be presenting to Sally Beck.

I will be contacting each of you in the next few days to set up the Stage 1 
interviews.  I look forward to working with each of you and to the successful 
completion of this project.

Please call with any questions or comments.  I can be reached at X39437.  

Kind Regards,

Todd Burke

memo that I distributed at the end of the meeting.  This memo will be sent by 
Rick Causey via notes mail regarding an additional role that I will assume 
with regard to global operations.  I shared this in the staff meeting so that 
you would be the first to know.  I will still fulfill my role within ENA as 
VP of Energy Operations.  I will not be going away!  This expanded 
responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel 
and will validate some of the global functions that we already provide to the 
organization.

informative, but the constantly changing formats kept everyone's attention.   
I believe the meeting also caused a renewed enthusiasm among your supervisory 
personnel.  This is not only my observation, but the feeling of all of the 
people that I have talked to over the past few weeks. 

Once again, congrats.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

February 15.  This is necessary in order to meet the Payroll deadline of 
exporting time to ETA (the Corporate payroll system), which is NOON on 
Wednesday, February 16.  Any timesheets that are not approved by the 10:00 
Tuesday deadline will automatically be approved by the Energy Operations

FYI - For the payroll period ending 1/31, there was only 1 timesheet 
outstanding at the established deadline.  In the past, there have been as

A lot of you may not be affected by Project Hurricane.  If you don't know 
anything about it, then you probably aren't affected by it!  In any event, we 
have set up 2 new E-work orders in the Org Database for Project Hurricane.  
They are as follows:

E-HURR (should be used to capture all time spent on the ongoing support for 
Project Hurricane)
E-HSET (should be used to capture all set-up costs)

Both of these work orders are set up and can be used for the 2/15 pay 
period.  However, the following steps must be taken for your employees to use 
the ATES system and code their time to these work orders:

MANAGERS - Identify employees within your RC that will need to charge time to 
either or both of these work orders.  Please let your Assistants know who 
these employees are.
ASSISTANTS - Based on the information you receive from your managers, you 
must add 1 or both of the work orders to each employee's profile in the Org 
Database so that they are able to charge time to the work order in ATES.
ASSISTANTS - For each Time Site you are responsible for, you must be sure to 
add this information to ETA.  If you aren't sure how to handle this, please 
contact Kim Perkins ASAP at x3-5304.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation in getting timesheets processed in 
a timely manner.  Please be sure to share this information with your staff if

Dorothy - 

Please advise Lisa that our expectation is that each Business Unit will 
largely have the final say in establishing office space standards for their 
workforce (as is the case today) .

Corporate may intercede only to the point that a Business Unit fails to 
design to a sufficient density (average sq. ft. per workplace) and does not 
meet minimum.  Hard policy has not been set but we expect to gain consensus 
from excelr's Executive Committee before detailed space planning begins.

(West Columbia Texas).  You were all contacted to save these dates on your 
calendars.  Both Cliff and I think this is an important opportunity for the 
business units to get together to discuss strategies and opportunities. We 
encourage you to attend for both days.

The goals of the offsite include:
 a) to discuss strategies and commercial opportunities necessary to meet our 
financial targets for 2000;
 b) to discuss resource requirements and organizational issues;
 and c) to provide an open forum to facilitate discussion and team building 
amongst the businesses.

Each business unit will have one hour to present its strategies and 
opportunities.  Specifically, we are asking the origination groups to 
describe their current strategy, detail the top 5 commercial 
deals/opportuntities for 2000 and to discuss any resource or organizational 
issues facing the unit.  Each trading organization will be asked to give a 
short market overview of their markets, identify three market or trading 
opportunities and discuss any resource or organizational issues facing that 
group.  Please submit your presentations to Kay Chapman no later than April 
28, 2000.  The agenda is quite agressive but we wanted to give everyone an 
opportunity to discuss their business.

A more detailed agenda and locations/times will follow shortly.

to discuss deal flow and communicate issues and opportunties - the Monday 
morning meeting and the Friday managing director meeting.  I would suggest 
that we eliminate both these meetings.  I would propose that we replace them 
with a single  Friday afternoon meeting from 2:30PM to 4:00PM. The business 
unit heads identified above would be invited.  At this meeting, I would 
expect less of a reporting focus and employ a more candid and detailed 
discussion of opportunities, problems and issues between the ""partners"" in 
this company.  It would include (i) a review of current DASH's, (ii) a more 
detailed discussion around the opportunities identified on the ""Hot Sheet"", 
(iii) a more candid discussion around the P&L and tactics required to meet 
overall financial targets and (iv) provide a forum to provide input into and 
communicate business strategies between the business units. In other words, 
employ the goals of the Friday managing director meeting with all the 
business unit leaders represented.

Given the religious holidays this week, there will be no meeting this 
Friday.  I would suggest that we have a regular Monday morning meeting next 
Monday and we will start this new forum a week from this Friday.  This 
meeting would be held in 30C1 and Monterrey, Calgary and Portland should be 
connected via video conference.  In order for this to work and be effective,  
the business unit heads need to be available and participate actively in the 
discussion.

If you have questions, comments or concerns do not hesitate to let me know.

offsite (probably the beginning of next week).  With a click, you will RSVP & 
indicate whether or not you need airline reservations.  If so, you will be 
forwarded to a travel agent who has been selected to make these

this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the excelr VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the excelr A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.


As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate 
Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on 
a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A

Jenny --

There are 25 owned and 6 leased fax machines on ECS 05 & 06 per the UBS asset scheduled.  After doing a walk though on the floors, the machines are concentrated in certain business areas.  Current machine placement will not accommodate the type of usage that I suspect Sally's group will need to have.

My suggestion is that the settlements group(s) bring their fax machines with them, and we have the numbers changed.

Mike Shanker called today and wants to spend Tuesday through Thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within Operations and Accounting.  His goal, on behalf of Frank Bisignano (which I am sure that I have misspelled), is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within Solomon Smith Barney.  

I told him that we would be glad to work with him.  We will involve Bob Hall, Jeff Gossett, Stacey White, Leslie Reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions.  

Mike says that Wes is sending him a functional org chart for his team today.  I will touch base with Wes to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts.    

Is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for?  --Sally ",Non Abusive

Barry would be good and I do believe that he is an asset.  I will talk with Wes and see what we can suggest. 

With regard to your comment that I am ""in"", in my conversation with Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like Mark Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.  And you can also count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there.  

Leslie Reeves will be getting the org charts to Tammie this afternoon before she leaves.  Gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts, as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts.

Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conversation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.  --Sally

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the excelr South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Why don't you let me take care of the flowers--I'll call Tarrytown Florist
and pick up the flowers for the 2nd.  I'll also do flowers for the tables.
Can you forward me the email from mom?

Do you have an idea of what you want in the announcement--I'll take care of
that as well.

Am still curious about that statistic regarding siblings of MS people.  I
know that the agent that causes MS is found in people moving to the
NorthEast (or other industrial North sections)--but if you are born there or
move there as an infant, you are generally immune.  Also, if you move there
past a certain age--like 12, you are also not at risk.  Think that is
particularly interesting since our move to CT proves that out--Cara was too
young and you were too old to be at risk....will still ask again next time I
see the neurologist.  It's amazing how you learn to cope--I sort of forget I
have MS most of the time.

What is lily of the valley?  I don't know.  Would it add anything special
to the coursage?  If so, I would be glad to spring for it.  I just don't
know enough about flowers to make an educated call.  Could the florist tell
you how wonderful it is for $60?

Meagan and Michael often have coursages and boutineers that coordinate -
maybe only key for the ""young set"", and not those who buy pens to
commemorate a 50th anniversary. White rose will be great if the florist
feels like the coordinated thing would be weird.  We will be upgrading dad
from a carnation, anyway.

You know in the end, whatever you arrange will be terrific.  I don't mean

Your info is right - although I do hope that all is not dark.  Wouldn't have imagined this outcome two weeks ago.  But when Bob Hall removed his name from the Netco list, timing was critical in working with potential purchasers in the auction process.  There wasn't anyone else to step in, so I did so just to help coordinate the due diligence effort and the transition.  I spent many hours with the UBS operations team last week, and they are the ones who decided that they wanted me to take the role.  It was the time that I spent with the UBS team that changed my mind about considering the role.  My reporting relationship will be to the head of American operations in Stamford, CT.

I have left several messages for you and have not heard back on where you
and your team are with your e-learning initiatives. Our understanding was
that you would contact us with an update after your meeting with Tim on May
16. It is now May 30 and we still have not heard back from you.

Do you need additional information from Viviance? If so, please let me know.
I believe I provided everything you requested. If you need more time, I
certainly understand.

I am in Detroit meeting with customers through Thursday but can be reached
on my cell phone at 512-762-5151 or a simple email response would be great.

We look forward to hearing from you soon and I hope all is well.

I have been out of the office so I am sorry for the late reply.  I called NABA and they have filled all of their technical sessions for the conference.  However, when we participate next year we will make sure to get you slotted in a session early .  The four free conference passes includes Wes Colwell's group.  We can purchase additional conference passes if you would like to send more employees.  

Thank you for you involvement.

Hello Sally, 

This e-mail is to confirm the message I left for you earlier this morning.  I have attached the speaking sessions below.  Please let me know as soon as possible the session that you would be interested in conducting for the NABA Conference.  Also, two of your employees are interested in participating at the conference Mark McClure and Errol McLauglin.  You have a total of four conferences passes to utilize for your group.  Please let me know if you would like them to attend for career development purposes.  They are both willing to recruit at the conference.  NABA is expecting over 2,000 professional participants this year.  Thank you for your support for the organization.  This will be a wonderful new partnership for excelr and your organization.

   Paul,

   Thanks for lunch a few weeks ago.  Sounds like you have a ton of work
   and responsibility these days.

   Also, thanks for working with Gros on CommodityLogic.  It is a great
   application that I think will help our industry better manage the ever
   increasing transaction flow.

   In addition to CommodityLogic, and as a follow-up to our lunch, I would
   like to come over in a few weeks and sit down and show you and your team
   what we mean by ""outsourcing"" your mid and back office functions to our
   ""ProsessCo/ServiceCo.""  I think we have identified what types of
   services we could offer and under what type of arrangements.  Basically,
   you have risk reporting, general ledger, deal capture, confirmation,
   nominations/scheduling, volume management and settlements (invoice and
   cash payments/collections).  We will articulate how it works and how it
   hopefully makes sense for you to let us add a few more resources to
   accomodate your growing business instead of you building it from
   scratch.

   I also talked to Whalley and Bibi about your concerns on
   security/neutrality, comparable service levels to excelr, term and the
   ability to do financial easier than physical.  We can go through all
   that as well.

   I will contact you soon and arrange a time.

   Let me know your thoughts.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

excelr arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
excelr has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  excelr has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

excelr in the Middle East 
excelr has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
excelr has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows excelr to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although excelr had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through excelrOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

excelr was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for excelr as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

To emerge from bankruptcy, excelr needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to excelr's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join excelr's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe excelr can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at excelr, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like excelrOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Subject:	2001 Andersen Audits

Attached below are the 2001 Andersen business audits and the timeline for these audits and other work. Within this document, we have identified the EES owner(s) that will be involved in each business audit. The scope/objectives of each business audit have also been outlined.

Business Audit Approach
For each business audit, we plan to hold an opening and closing meeting with all key personnel involved for that project (includes business owners, CAO, EAS representative, and Andersen). The objectives of the opening meeting are to discuss specific audit areas, team members, key contacts, and to identify required EES documentation. The closing meeting will be critical as this is the final opportunity to ensure all facts surrounding any issues are agreed upon and initially discuss any action plans. Timing of the opening/closing meetings will be communicated by Andersen at a later date.

Please review the attached Andersen document to ensure the business owners have been properly identified. Please contact me with any revisions or other questions.

Thanks,
Misty

Free Opera in the Park featuring Houston Grand Opera's Carmen, June 8-10!
Houston Grand Opera's sensational Multimedia Modular Stage production returns for three FREE performances at Houston's Miller Outdoor Theatre on June 8-10 at 8:30 p.m. Bizet's fiery gypsy Carmen, everybody's favorite femme fatale, ignites the summer in a powerhouse production that had audiences and critics cheering when it was first unveiled in 1998.

Houston Grand Opera's revolutionary Multimedia Modular Stage (MMS), with its giant ""live"" video screens, hydraulic platforms, and hundreds of rotating, colored lights takes the incredible energy onstage and transports it to the farthest reaches of the outdoor venue with a visceral impact equal to that of a rock concert!

Tickets for the reserved seating will be issued between the hours of 11:30am and 1:00pm through the Miller Theatre box office on the day of the performance.  Any remaining tickets will be issued one hour before the performance.

Each Cost Center Owner is responsible for keeping track of their Contractors' hours on a monthly basis, as well as ensuring Contractor compliance with this mandate.

At the end of each month, ENW Accounting is providing Contractor reporting to Office of the Chair.  However, the accuracy of this report is dependent on Contractors entering their time into SAP.

As a result, going forward, a second ""non-compliance"" report will be submitted to Office of the Chair on a monthly basis, detailing Contractors not entering their time and the Contractor supervisor.  Please contact Diane Latson (X5-7184) if you believe your contractors are exceptions and should not be entering time.

Contractor Time Entry

Contractors are required to enter their time in eHRonline to one of the following: (1) project numbers, which are called WBS Elements; (2) cost centers, which are associated to a specific department and not a formal project.  It is the Supervisor's responsibility to ensure Contractors are provided with the proper project or cost center coding.

Unlike invoice coding, SAP will only accept a Cost Center or WBS element number for each time entry line.  This means that you cannot enter a Cost Center and a WBS element number on the same line.  SAP will read this information from left to right and will only pick up the first entry.  For example:

		CostCenter		WBS Element			
		123456		c.9999.99.99.99		

The system will look at this entry and all time will be charged as expense to Cost Center 123456.

Consistent with the floor talks of a couple weeks ago, we are following up with an e-mail describing the latest changes in our risk and back-office functions that are now complete.  EES's Risk Management and the vast majority of EES's Risk Controls and Operations Group will become a new group in excelr Wholesale Services. This group's sole function will be to provide pricing, structuring, commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services for EES.  Both Don Black and Wanda Curry will report to the EWS Office of the Chairman. 

This change was driven by the explosive growth of EES and the resulting need to tap the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale groups in order to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.  This change will allow us to more quickly capture the benefits of scale, process, and technology in risk, logistics and back-office functions from the larger excelr capability.  As discussed at the All Employee Meeting in March, these are important objectives, and this change allows us to reach those goals more quickly. 

Specifically, the following groups within the former EES Risk Management Group, will become a part of this new group reporting to Don Black:

-	the gas, power and tariff desks,
-	the options desk,
-	the site profiles and consumption desks, and
-	the matrix products/secondary products desks.

The DSM Group and IAM, along with its execution capability, will remain in EES and report to the EES Office of the Chairman. We are pleased to announce that Ozzie Pagan has agreed to lead this function.  Ozzie is an established commercial dealmaker in ENA.  He has experience in power trading, origination and plant development. In addition, the Services Group, which will provide billing, information and other retail services, led by Evan Hughes, will remain in EES and report to the EES OOC.  All support functions, within the former EES Risk Controls and Operations Group, that currently support the DSM and the Services Groups, will remain in EES.  The remaining parts of the Risk Controls and Operations Group will become part of EWS reporting to Wanda Curry.  As part of this change, we are pleased to add Evan Hughes and Ozzie Pagan to the EES Operating Committee.

In addition, the Structuring Group, led by Sean Holmes, will be re-named Deal Management.  The vision for this group remains the same as that discussed at the All Employee Meeting; however, it will also facilitate and ensure productive transaction interaction between EES and EWS.

We have asked, Marty Sunde, as part of his Vice Chairman role, to resource and lead a formal Restructuring Group to enhance or protect value in several key transactions in our portfolio primarily in  California. 


The newly created IT function, led by Anthony Dayao, will continue to report into the EES OOC but will support both EES and EWS IT requirements.

Other than these changes, the organizational structure, vision and objectives detailed out for EES at the All-Employee Meeting in March remain.  We need to continue to understand and drive deeper into our markets, manage our client relationships, mine our portfolio, build new products and execute on our opportunities.

Thanks for all your hard work.  With your help we will become the Worlds Leading Energy Retailer and excelr's Leading Division.  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask

Subject:	Fred Philipson: Deal confirmation: Weak link in the risk management chain    No matter how fast ...


04/01/2001
Global Energy Business
Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.

  According to The New York Times, on March 2 of this year a broker misplaced
the decimal point while executing an order on the Nasdaq stock exchange. A day
trader, who thought he had made a profit of $145,000, later discovered he had
actually lost $130,000. Although all the systems executing the trade were
electronic, the error was made by a human.

  This anecdote should strike a nerve at energy trading firms, which spend the
bulk of their time trying to quantify and manage the risks they take. One of
the first and most valuable lessons they learned about risk management came
courtesy of Nick Leeson, the rogue trader who brought down the investment bank
Barings in the mid 1990s. That lesson was: You can't control risk unless you
separate your front and back offices.

  However, the careers of many energy traders begin in the back office.
Managers believe that if a ``kid'' makes a mistake there, at least it won't
bring down the company. But although on-line energy exchanges have increased
the velocity and volume of trading, they've done nothing to reduce the amount
of work involved in confirming deals. Confirmation is still a manual,
paper-driven process of verifying signatures and assembling evidentiary
documents to support deals. While the front office turns to fancier and more
powerful analytical software and the middle office deploys state-of-the-art
risk management systems, life in the back office continues to test humans'
tolerance for tedium.

  The importance of deal confirmation cannot be overstated. In addition to
being a legal and binding act, confirmation serves as the last opportunity to
prevent a deal from being transacted wrongly. As transaction volumes rise, so
do the opportunities for introducing human error during the deal confirmation
process. Confirmation represents a potential source of operational risk that
cannot be hedged.

  Zero tolerance
When asked what he considers the biggest offense a trader could make, Jim
Donnell, CEO of Houston-based Duke Energy North America, answered without
hesitation, ``doing a deal and not recording it.'' He says he'd even fire a
trader for being that sloppy. ``The only thing worse,'' adds Greg Hickl, head
power trader for Tulsa-based Williams Energy, would be ``if a trader tries to
hide a trading mistake.''

  At energy trading firms, mistakes have little chance of remaining covered up
for long. If their electronic systems are working correctly, both the middle
and back offices should receive a confirmation from the broker or counterparty
for every deal made. But when markets are volatile, Hickl explains, ``honest''
mistakes are more likely to happen, and the back office may have a difficult
time catching them. The proliferation of streamlined systems that enable a
trade to be entered in 15 seconds or less and generate its own confirmation
are giving front offices more control over the risks inherent in the use of
manual, back-room processes.

  It's important to realize that although process automation and systems
integration can mitigate confirmation risk, they cannot eliminate it--because
humans are still involved in the process. Once two traders make a deal, the
middle or back office of their companies still must contact each other to
confirm its details.

  Go with the deal flow
Although the front, middle, and back offices have slightly different
responsibilities at different energy trading firms, this is not evident to the
outside world. All energy traders do business in much the same way (Figure 1).
At most trading houses, trades are made and entered--captured, in other
words--in the front office by traders, their analysts, assistants, deal input
clerks, or even by a pool of deal-capture specialists.

  Trade capture is important for several reasons: for correct invoicing,
proper risk control, and acknowledging ``intent to pay.'' Depending on the
type of deal (see table), the confirmation desk will either phone or fax the
counterparty to confirm it, wait to receive a confirmation from the other
party, or initiate a confirmation. If the deal was done on an on-line
exchange, the confirmation desk will also check to see that the exchange
recorded the transaction. If a trade has a physical component, the seller's
scheduling desk also plays a role, by ``nominating,'' or scheduling, the flow
of energy.

  A steep learning curve
As mentioned, neophytes may comprise much of the staff of back-room
confirmation desks. They have a lot to learn back there, including the jargon
of the industry and the difference between floating- and fixed-price deals.

  It helps if these entry-level personnel are quick studies, because in many
ways energy trading is more complicated than financial trading. In financial
markets, no more than 20 currencies or 10 interest rates comprise the universe
of traded commodities. In equity markets, there are thousands of stocks, but
no forward market (with the exception of equity options).

  In the North American gas market, by contrast, there may be 60 basis
locations each trading two years out at any time. Newcomers also have to learn
to handle options, thousands of price points (specifying delivery location and
time period), and deals for transmission and storage capacity. If the market
has high volatility, large notional values, large transaction volumes, low
margins, and long settlement cycles--as physical energy markets do--the
dangers of using antiquated processes are far greater than in financial
markets, which trade in ``virtual'' money.

  The physical nature of commodity electricity raises the complexity of
trading it to another level. In the U.S., electricity is specified on an
hourly basis. In the U.K., it's half-hourly. In Germany, it's every 15
minutes. Volumes and prices must be specified for each time slot. In physical
deals, the high penalties for throwing the delivery systems out of balance
behoove counterparties to capture and confirm deals with great accuracy.

  To err is human
As the transaction volume and volatility of a market increase, so do the
chances of making a mistake and the penalties for doing so. Mistakes can be
made when a trade is made, when it is entered into the system, when it is
confirmed, when energy is delivered, and even as late as when a payment is
made. Modern electronic trading systems incorporate many checks and balances
to help catch human errors, but some still slip through.

  The manual process of deal confirmation is particularly error-prone because
it may require the handling and matching of media as different as paper faxes,
tapes of phone conversations, and electronic files. Exacerbating the problem,
there is no industry-standard confirmation form. Nothing prevents a trading
firm from burying a paragraph of legalese at the bottom of its document, which
is why traders like to hire people for the back office with a strong attention
to detail. Ironically, paper fax and verbal confirmations are still the
preferred media, as e-mail is still not considered secure enough. Even the
simplest deal may generate three to five faxed pages for confirmation
purposes.

  Because energy trading is so complex and demands such high  accuracy, deal
confirmation is a stressful job. One trader reports that the people who do
deal confirmation at his firm dread hearing from the firm's traders, because
they only call when someone in the back office makes a mistake. Some companies
try to reduce the stress by distributing the confirmation workload throughout
the day. But at most others, the rule remains hard and fast: All transactions
of the previous day must be confirmed by noon the next day.

  To catch an error, divine
How successful are humans at catching errors made at the deal-confirmation
stage? It depends. One top trading firm--whose confirmation desk is staffed by
new hires that typically last only last six months on the job--estimates that
as many as two out of every five deals it makes contain an error of some kind.
Another--which entrusts this task to more-senior personnel--estimates a 5%
error rate. But this does not include spot deals which start the next day.

  Unlike market risk, which can be managed, the operational risk related to
errors in deal confirmation cannot be hedged in ways other than building a
wall between the front and back offices, endless checking and rechecking, and
using good personnel and procedure management practices. Money is also a
factor in dealing with confirmation errors. If a firm fires someone who makes
a $500 mistake, it will then have to spend many times that to train someone
else to do his or her job.

  Legal risks
Rather than wait to receive deal confirmations, some traders initiate them,
both for legal reasons and to exert greater control over the process. There
are two types of confirmations in use today: positive and negative. A positive
confirmation requires both parties to agree that a trade has been made between
them, and that the trade meets agreed-upon specifications.

  A negative confirmation, by contrast, presumes that the other party has
agreed to the deal unless it is notified to the contrary by a certain date and
time. This practice, which speeds up the confirmation process (and therefore
enables increases in transaction volume) is the norm at on-line exchanges.
excelrOnline, for instance, automatically sends a confirming fax to every party
with whom it does a deal. If it fails to receive a response to the contrary
within a certain number of business days, excelr assumes that the deal is
confirmed. The main problem with negative confirmation is that it allows a
counterparty that spots a mistake in its favor to keep quiet about the error.

  Toward automation
Several vendors of trading software have added automatic deal confirmation to
the list of features of their integrated product suites. Among them is
Houston-based Altra Technologies, whose vice president David Hanson explains
that, ``Automatic trade confirmation is the first step on the road to
straight-through processing.''

  Trading firms have begun to take notice of straight-through processing (or
STP, a term that implies the removal of humans from all points along the
deal-processing chain) for obvious reasons. Less-costly and more-powerful
integrated systems and middleware will doubtless foster the proliferation of
STP, allowing more traders to automate their existing, manual
deal-confirmation processes. However, the complete automation of energy
trading industry-wide will still require standardization. All market
participants--including their legal departments--will have to agree on a
common format and procedures for confirming deals.

  STP--the trader's edge
In addition to eliminating human confirmation errors, another big benefit of
STP is that it promises to enable energy traders to do more trades of greater
complexity more quickly. The nomination and confirmation processes being put
in place in the U.K. in preparation for the shift to the New Electricity
Trading Arrangements (NETA) this spring are a good example of how complex and
time-critical energy trading is becoming. Under the new rules, electricity
schedules will be defined on a half-hourly basis, and all 48 time slots in the
day must be specified by volume and price in a two-hour time window from 6:00
to 8:00 p.m.

  Oliver Mills, vice president of European sales for New York-based Caminus,
believes that it will be impossible for traders to meet these time constraints
while doing 100 to 1,000 deals a day, unless they automate their business
processes. So Caminus has added a matching engine called ZGrid to its Zai*Net
software suite.

  Based on a subset of XML standards, ZGrid replaces fax confirmations and
shows an audit trail of all information exchanged between buyer and seller.
The system obviously works when both counterparties have ZGrid, but it also
works when the party on the other end has trading software that is compatible
with the so-called excelr Spec. Developed by excelr, this specification--also
called the Group of Seven spec--is supported by the seven leading participants
in the new U.K. energy market. The spec itself delineates the physical format
of, and procedures for executing, a trade.

  Another software vendor targeting the nascent deal-automation market is
TradeCapture.com, based in Stamford, Conn. According to Chief Marketing
Officer Matt Frye, the company's Integrated Commodity Trading System (ICTS
2000) automatically updates a trading firm's internal records of scheduled,
confirmed, and actual shipments, giving it both a real-time and a historical
view of its positions. The system can initiate the sending of deal-confirming
electronic files, faxes, and telexes.

  Altra's David Hanson hits the nail on the head in describing automated trade
confirmation as the first step on the road to STP. After a deal is confirmed,
it must still be cleared and settled. Two new companies say they have found a
way to automate those processes too.

  One is Houston-based EnergyClear, which says it is the first
industry-sponsored clearinghouse to offer comparison, netting, and settlement
of wholesale energy contracts to over-the-counter (OTC) energy traders.
Co-founder and president Lee Burton believes EnergyClear will revolutionize
the OTC energy markets by reducing traders' credit, legal, operational, and
liquidity risks, which in the long run will increase those markets' depth and
liquidity. Counterparties must still confirm their deals, however, before
turning to EnergyClear.

  The other new firm eyeing OTC energy markets--and other OTC commodity
markets as well--is NexClear Inc., Boulder, Colo. The company says it will
soon be offering centralized clearing, fulfillment, and delivery services to
all OTC-traded commodity markets. In addition, it will also guarantee
transactions, monitor credit risk, provide trade data, and perform necessary
middle and back-office services. The NexClear system will allow traders to use
the Web to enter details of their trades in a confirmation window.

  Outsource to ease risk
Checking the details of deals more diligently and automating the confirmation
process are only two approaches that energy traders can take to minimize their
operational risk. Another is to hire a third party to guarantee that
unforeseen events won't cause financial pain--a practice akin to buying
insurance.

  A company that offers such a service to energy trading companies is
Houston-based Confirmation Clearing Corp (CCC). Founder and President Chris
Papousek advises that, ``A good way to test the readiness of an organization
to cope with a counterparty default is to run an occasional fire drill--to
expose gaps in processes that can then be filled when the clock isn't
ticking.''

  He urges energy trading firms to consider using an independent third
party--such as CCC--to eliminate the legal risks of deal confirmation. If both
parties to a deal are subscribers to the company's service, they would send
their version of its details to CCC and have CCC do the work of matching and
confirmation. Both would be covered against errors and omissions by the
equivalent of an insurance policy. Figure 2 shows how the service works. Note
the connections to EnergyClear and NexClear, which are responsible for
clearing and settlement.

  Papousek believes that a confirmation service such as the one his company
offers can work only if it is centralized, independently owned, and works in
real time with all commodity markets and trading platforms. ``The last thing
you want in the confirmation arena,'' he says, ``is a fragmented solution that
only works with a single system or a finite number of commodities.''

Subject:	Initial Valuation Model / Back Office

Hi All:

I was talking to Fred today and we thought that it would be a good idea to distribute a summary of the initial valuation model of the Back Office opportunity (as created by Marc Eichmann).  

It'll be great to get feedback and work together so we can validate this assumptions and refine the model as much as we can. Please pay attention to the following:

?	excelr cost per transaction
?	Sale prices (assumptions)
?	Profit margins (these are derived from the sale price per transaction)
?	Transaction counts

Please note that there are three scenarios, P50 being the expected case.

We will also need to validate all the revenue related assumptions with market and customer information (Is there any sort of market or customer research done? Do we know how much will a customer be willing to pay for the services?, etc.).

I'll be glad to meet with you and explain the assumptions and how the model works.

I can be reached at extension 54658. Thanks for your time.

You guys have probably seen this, but wanted to make sure -- London is kicking off a huge effort to look at replacing the AS400 for metals.  (See presentation attached below)

Paul Freeman should be very good in this capacity, based upon what I know of his prior experience.  They have also assigned some fairly senior people to work with him full time.

Am discussing with Mike Jordan in further detail on Thursday, and will encourage him to provide another status update on the Metals business (including recycling)

We feel very comfortable with the functionality and display of information contained within the module.  All of our major issues have been resolved.  Therefore, I am comfortable giving my approval that ConfirmLogic is ready for release to the Beta Customers for testing.

Dear Kim:

The CommodityLogic team presents ConfirmLogic to excelr for the beta program, which excelr will be a key participant. The following are the current parameters for how the system will perform during this program.

Negative Confirmation
?If deal status is 'Pending' and current date is 3 business days past the post date; ConfirmLogic changes deal status from 'Pending' to 'Confirmed'. 


Updating Existing Deals
?No restrictions on updates - counterparties can send deal changes at any time for any deal.

	
Viewing Confirmed Deals
?ConfirmLogic allows view-only capability to deals that have been confirmed (user cannot post inquiry or add deal number).

Deal Types Offered
?ConfirmLogic will be offering the following deal types:  
Financial Natural Gas: Swaps, Gas Daily Swap, Options, Gas Daily Options Swaptions
Financial Power: Swaps, Options, Swaptions
Physical Power: Forwards, Index Forwards, Options, Swaption 

During the beta program the following open issues related to the system functionality will be discussed with our beta clients in order to establish an industry standard.  The goal will be to modify the system with the final business rules for the commercial release.  excelr will participate in the discussion and decision making process during the program.

Negative Confirmation
?Mirror industry standard and apply same rule for all deal types.
	
Expiration of Inquired Deals
?Expire inquired deals when no actions have been taken for a defined period of time.


Updating Existing Deals  
?Allow updates and develop method for defining intent of information published to CommodityLogic.


Agreement on Other Terms
?Assumed agreement for terms not presented in ConfirmLogic in place between counterparties before committing to use module.

This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

I believe you are aware that we are working to the 10th of May to start to use RiskTrac for UK Power VAR purposes (if you are not then you know now !). Are you cutting us some slack to use these limits between now and then or do we need to report violations if we are over our 'old' limits between now and then ?

Rick Buy's expectations after talking to Sherriff and supporting the new higher trading limits for UK Power are that UK Power's VaR will be calculated using the corporate approved VaR engine - ie., RisktRAC.  My understanding was this would be done by the May BOD meeting which was yesterday, so maybe it's already happened.  Would you please let me know the status?

Thanks for lunch a few weeks ago.  Sounds like you have a ton of work and responsibility these days.

Also, thanks for working with Gros on CommodityLogic.  It is a great application that I think will help our industry better manage the ever increasing transaction flow.

First, we need to determine what each piece is in the mid/back office that can be commercialized and how we would separate these different pieces.  In other words, how we separate risk reporting and general ledger and where we put it at excelr.  How we put the physical gas nominations and power scheduling at the desks.  How we take the rest for gas and power (and/or financial) and create ProcessCo/ServiceCo as a separate entity or within Net Works.

Second, once we know the different pieces, can we separate them from a systems perspective ( I am assuming that separating people is straightforward)?

Third, assuming we can separate things, how we communicate back to the other parts.  In other words, how we communicate information back to excelr's SAP system, how we settle for excelr if they want ProcessCo to do physical settlements, how we receive information so we can deal capture and confirm, etc.  All the linkages.

Fourth, how we create an agreement between ProcessCo and EWS that defines payments, service levels, term, etc. that can be a model for other companies as well.

Fifth, how this all deals with CommodityLogic and its business model.

Sixth, if we go alone or work with someone like Arcordia (after Beth's meeting).

Finally, how we originate these deals and charge for our service.

I know that alot of this is being done in different parts on different time schedules, but I would like to get it all pulled together soon in the following format:

A draft of a contract between EWS and ProcessCo (or Net Works).  Also, a clear picture of what systems and functions would be in this entity.  Also, a recommendation on how excelr maintains its risk reporting and general ledger as well as physical noms and scheduling and where that stays in excelr and how those functions work with ProcessCo.

Sheri Thomas, Jeff Harbert, Frank Davis, Fred Philipson, and Andrea Crump are now full time reporting to Tom on commercialization, all have mid/back office experience and can help Beth and Sally with alot of this work before Tom comes back from his cruise at the end of next week.

Let's discuss Monday.

Thanks.

To better leverage intellectual capital across excelr Net Works, we have several organizational announcements to share with you:

Sally Beck, Tom Gros and Beth Perlman will work together to direct our efforts to ""commercialize"" our mid and back office services.  They will report to the ENW Office of the Chair.  Sally will continue to lead the day-to-day operations of our mid & back office.  In addition to leading the development and marketing of Commodity Logic, Tom will have primary responsibility for the marketing of our mid & back office services.  Beth will continue to lead IT development for the Americas, including Commodity Logic and all other systems necessary to deliver mid & back office services.  Joining Tom's marketing team are Sheri Thomas, Frank Davis, Andrea Crump, Jeff Harbert and Fred Philipson.  

The excelrOnline Product Control function, currently reporting to Sheri Thomas, will fold into excelrOnline Operations.  Savita Puthigai will lead the combined group, which will have responsibility for all non-IT day-to-day operations.  Sheri will move to the mid & back office commercialization effort reporting to Tom Gros.  Jennifer Denny will assume Sheri's responsibilities as the lead for product control.

Amita Gosalia, director of excelrOnline Europe Support, has accepted a new position with EBS in London.  With her departure, Lara Fields will assume responsibility for the excelrOnline support team in Europe and report to Savita.  Paul Goddard will continue to lead our marketing efforts in Europe and report directly to Andy Zipper, who will continue to lead all of excelrOnline's activities.  Angela Connelly will continue to manage excelrOnline's content in Europe and report to Kal Shah.  Additionally, John Pavetto, John Cummings, John Allario, Mike Haney and Jake Staffel will join Andy's team to focus on origination opportunities around the excelrOnline application.

Rex Shelby and David Berberian will focus on special initiatives and new business opportunities.  Brandon Wax will manage ENW's investment portfolio.  Mark S. Palmer will lead the Transaction Development and Structuring team.  In their new roles, Rex, Brandon and Mark will report to the ENW Office of the Chair.

As you know, we will only get one chance to make a good impression and it is our sale, not EA's, so we are in complete control of what we pitch and how we pitch it.

On you going personally, I am not real sure who the attendees should be so let's discuss that next plan next week. 

What are your initial thoughts at possibly doing their mid/back office?  Lot's of physical and financial gas and power in North America.

Paul,

Thanks for lunch a few weeks ago.  Sounds like you have a ton of work and responsibility these days.

Also, thanks for working with Gros on CommodityLogic.  It is a great application that I think will help our industry better manage the ever increasing transaction flow.

In addition to CommodityLogic, and as a follow-up to our lunch, I would like to come over in a few weeks and sit down and show you and your team what we mean by ""outsourcing"" your mid and back office functions to our ""ProsessCo/ServiceCo.""  I think we have identified what types of services we could offer and under what type of arrangements.  Basically, you have risk reporting, general ledger, deal capture, confirmation, nominations/scheduling, volume management and settlements (invoice and cash payments/collections).  We will articulate how it works and how it hopefully makes sense for you to let us add a few more resources to accomodate your growing business instead of you building it from scratch.  

I also talked to Whalley and Bibi about your concerns on security/neutrality, comparable service levels to excelr, term and the ability to do financial easier than physical.  We can go through all that as well.

I will contact you soon and arrange a time.

Let me know your thoughts.

We had a conversation today with Kishkill.  He said that he was more interested in just understanding how the back office was presently working.  His concern is that the volumes will be picking up substantially in Sept./ Oct.  and we will not be properly staffed.  He also said that he would be back here towards the end of June and he would try to meet with you.  

If the volume picks up significantly,  we should look into the following (in my view):

1.  Setting up the back office shop in South America,  or
2.  At least hiring a back office liason between the two offices so that both commercial and controls have a comfort level.

You have the relationship with Paul, so I would suggest that you go.  I think that only one of the two of us needs to be there, given the additional attendee list of Tom, Tommy, Sheri and Bob.  I would say that of that group, the most credible (i.e. knowledge of the business, the operations functions and our systems that support them) are Bob Hall and Tommy.  If you feel like we should cut down the number of excelr attendees, this is just my two cents worth.  

Just for a time-frame reference regarding Thomas McAndrew's departure date, I took the role over operations in January 1997.  I still owe you the ""bear in the bicycle story"" over a beer sometime to give you an idea of the state of the union when I took the role.  We did a lot of upgrading of personnel in 1997, changed our internal definitions of acceptable performance, and created dedicated teams to work on the implementation of Sitara and Unify (in 1998 and 1999).  We probably weren't doing a great job in operations when Thomas left.   

I got with Sheri right after our meeting and gave her slides that I thought would be most effective in the presentation.  I also gave her appropriate stats for operational performance.  I will review the revised presentation tomorrow morning before you see the next version.   I will also take a look at Bob Shults' presentations, as it sounds as if the tone is similar to the one that we would like to use.  It is working for Bob, so if there is something there that we can copy, we will do it!  --Sally

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested excelr employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Thanks for your support.

We have not yet been given details of what transition teams will be created and what our roles will be in these. It is pretty safe, however, to expect that we will need an IT team(s) looking at all aspects of all businesses, from front to back. It is also fair to presume that we will likely start from the back office and work towards the front as governance allows.

Once we have details of exactly what is expected of us, we will determine the makeup of the team(s).

Many thanks again for your support.

Subject:	Merger Transition Teams

Mark,

While excelr's management teams are reviewing actions plans for the upcoming six to nine months, I understand that functional transition teams will be assembled to address the planned merger.  I would like to register my strong interest in assisting any transition team where my skills could add value. Prior to developing and supporting corporate as well as enterprise systems at excelr my career has spanned across General Electric Capital Services and ABB on a global basis. Much of this experience has included system integration and change management.  

Let me know if you have any questions to the above.  Otherwise, I wanted to let you know of my interest and desire in working towards a successful transition for excelr.

Regards,

Allan Sommer

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of excelr.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of excelr's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at excelr, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore excelr to its rightful place in the energy industry.

The 5,000 increase in New Counterparties is a combination of new deals booked last week and existing deals (prior to last week) that were mass mapped to the New Counterparty I.D. in RPS by a recent technology development.  The attached report does not include deals that have been booked, but not mapped to new counterparty (""no counterparty"").  In credit agg, these deals show up as ""new counterparty"".  We are making this change to the report effective this week.  If this was in the report originally, you would have seen the 5,000 deals move from ""no counterparty"" to ""new counterparty"".  Still, this does not address the issue of mapping to valid, real counterparty i.d.'s.    The following things are in progress by several teams to solve and end the problems:

1)  New process for Mass Market - As Molly has described below, we are very close to booking Mass Market transactions into RPS with GCP i.d.  Several things had to happen to reach this goal, a few of which Molly has noted.  We expect to go live next week, provided RPS is ready.
2)  Above process for remaining deals - Discussions have begun to work GCP set up into the upfront process, the goal to book deals with GCP i.d. where we can.
3)  Complete GCP interface with RGS - In testing.  Expected by end of week (11/16).
4)  Complete GCP interface with RPS - EES IT currently working.  Requirements have been provided by GCP.
5)  Clean up existing transactions - We can not efficiently make a dent into the ""backlog"" of unmapped customers until we stop the bleeding.  Mapping in RPS is an extremely manual and time-consuming process, coupled by recurring system ""downs"" and technical issues. Technical developments must assist in this process.  Additional resources does not solve the problem and in itself is limiting.  As soon as 1 above is implemented, the resources can be focused on mapping existing deals (clean up) and staying current on new non-mass market deals (2).  A completion plan will be developed and monitored and add'l resources re-assigned accordingly.
6)  Reporting correct exposure - All of the above does us little good without correct related MTM exposure, which is currently not available.  Risk is working with IT to correct the RPS valuation for Mass Market activity.  This effort is expected to be completed by the middle of December.  When complete, daily counterparty exposure for all Mass Market transactions will be available in credit agg.
Note:  The above points do not address CSC / GCP integrations for billing systems.

In summary, it is taking time to develop technical fixes to process the volume.  In the meantime, we have signed 25,000+ Mass Market contracts, half of which have been done in the last 8 weeks.  We are now receiving 600-1100 Mass Market contracts per day.  In addition, there is approx. 2,500 existing deals that should be booked this week.  You can expect the # to increase significantly again this week.

Please feel free to call Scott, James or me with any questions regarding our plans to get through this.  Additionally, we would like to propose a meeting to address all concerns.  Please reply to me with your interest and I will set up.

Regards,
Shelly

Subject:	RE: EES Weekly Status

Bill

This problem is stemming from the volume in Mass Market as you know.  As a result, significantly more new transactions are being booked to ""New Counterpart""  than can be cleaned up from historical deals.  As Credit has been emphasizing for some months now, this is not acceptable for this business, is not maintainable (proof in the attached report) and IT resources are required to automate current manual processes.

Global Counterparty is testing their new process to automate the set up of new counterparts in GCP such that the GCP ID may also be returned to EES in conjunction with our credit response prior to booking (expected delivery next Monday0.   However, the risk system batch process specifically for RPS must be enhanced to automatically create the counterpart and accept the GCP ID.  Efforts are finally underway to this end and are expected to be tested within the week.  Then, downstream processing through to billing may benefit.

Many lack the clear understanding that it has taken not only GCP to set up the counterpart in Global Counterpart but also Deal Capture to establish and map the counterpart in RPS and RGS (both have been manual procesess, the latter severly under resourced).  

Once this is implemented, EES has over 20,000 Mass Market transactions executed now, so efforts need to continue to clean up this backlog.  More importantly, three companies have already filed bankruptcy.  We must complete these efforts to manage the portfolio and respond to these events.

Regards
Molly

It was an irresistible proposition: Borrow billions of dollars, pay no inte=
rest, reap millions in tax breaks, and then wait for the debt to simply dis=
appear. That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companie=
s from excelr to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money.=20
But, of course, there was a catch: For this scenario to play out, a company=
's stock price had to rise sharply--and quickly. That's because investors b=
ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock ta=
nked, the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more a=
ttractive to buyers, companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stoc=
k price failed to rise sufficiently, investors could ""put"" (that is, sell) =
the bonds back to the company--in many cases, after just one year.
And that's exactly what's about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion =
over the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas=
t half of these special hybrids, the prospect of conversion is now absurd. =
It simply won't happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back =
the first chance they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible=
. Suddenly companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on the hook fo=
r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they'd never have t=
o pay.=20
That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all,=
 they're the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt=
 comes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay=
 bondholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into th=
is camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow =
money anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are inv=
estors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer r=
efinancing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o=
ff the debt, creating significant shareholder dilution, especially at curre=
nt depressed prices. To make matters worse, this is happening at a time whe=
n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin=
king. ""This is a ticking time bomb,"" warns Margaret Patel, manager of the P=
ioneer High Yield Bond fund, a top-performing junk fund.=20
The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000, when the stock market started=
 to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling=
 stock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bo=
nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn't have to ma=
ke cash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name ""zero""). Instead iss=
uers offered an up-front discount--for instance, investors would buy a bond=
 for $700 and collect $1,000 when it matured.=20
Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n=
umber of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo=
uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases, b=
y more than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premiu=
m), zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest, and once their=
 stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels, the debt would be swep=
t away into equity. ""If the bonds are converted, it's a home run for everyb=
ody,"" says Jonathan Cohen, vice president of convertible-bond analysis at D=
eutsche Bank.=20
That four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price rising. If=
 it doesn't, the bondholders, armed with that handy put feature, can simply=
 sell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders, but not so hot =
for the company or its shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that ha=
ppening? ""CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u=
p,"" says Cohen. ""They don't worry about the bond getting put.""=20
If all this seems a little complicated, that's because it is. A real-life e=
xample should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 bil=
lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time, the company=
's stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opin=
ion of company management. ""We really didn't want to sell equity at that po=
int,"" says Bob Kelly, Calpine's senior vice president of finance. So the co=
mpany instead opted to sell zeros, setting the conversion premium at a heft=
y 37%.=20
Still, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si=
gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds weren't exactly a scre=
aming buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could =
sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric=
e, eliminating any downside risk.=20
Things haven't exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has si=
nce plummeted to $25, and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens=
e. So it's looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in b=
orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. Th=
ere's also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine's borrowing ra=
te could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in =
cash. ""Obviously, nobody plans for their stock to go down,"" Kelly says. ""I =
don't think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put.""=
=20
Calpine's potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i=
s straddling junk. ""If you are a borderline investment-grade company, a fin=
ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the =
world,"" notes Anand Iyer, head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta=
nley. The problem is, there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r=
atings out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit Suisse First Boston's head of convert=
ible-bond research, estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall=
 into the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings dow=
ngraded before the put date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 per=
centage points above bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a pri=
cey proposition.=20
Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high =
price of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to b=
uy back this January, and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over th=
e next couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales, the company=
 was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if=
 Solectron's credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide into junk status, =
a situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of mill=
ions of dollars in refinancing charges.=20
Refinancing isn't the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Comp=
anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of th=
e amount raised. If the debt is sold back, many will have spent millions fo=
r what essentially amounted to a one-year loan. ""They're getting bad advice=
,"" claims one banker who didn't want to be named. ""Look at the fee the bank=
er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into.""=20
As if those potential consequences were not scary enough, shareholders can =
also get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That's because some 40% a=
re bought by hedge funds, which short the company's stock (sell borrowed sh=
ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same t=
ime that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down, the shorts make money =
from their position. If it goes up, they profit by converting the bond to s=
tock. This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet, at l=
east for a while. Grocery chain Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% o=
f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros.=
=20
Despite all the pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu=
es, thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro=
vide. In fact, the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form =
of financing. Even better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies c=
an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they're act=
ually paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest=
 if certain conditions prevail. Verizon Communications, for instance, would=
 pay 0.25% annual interest on its $3 billion in zero bonds if its stock pri=
ce falls below 60% of the issue's conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS,=
 oddly, that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction=
, for tax purposes, of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on its regular debt. (Wh=
y? Trust us, you don't want to know.) That adds up to an annual deduction o=
f more than $200 million, even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere=
st. Not surprisingly, more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain si=
milar clauses. ""It's an incredible deal for them,"" says Vadim Iosilevich, w=
ho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management. ""Not only are they=
 raising cheap money, they're also doing tax arbitrage.""=20
So despite the enormous risks to shareholders, companies continue to issue =
zeros at a steady clip: According to ConvertBond.com, seven new issues, tot=
aling $3.5 billion, have been sold since Oct. 1 alone. ""I think the power o=
f the tax advantage is going to keep them around,"" says CSFB's Seidel. Call=
 it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it =
doesn't really matter. Either way, it's the shareholders who'll be left pay=

Manager's Journal: What excelr Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of=
 age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Luc=
ent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (=
CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky busin=
ess. The latest example is excelr, whose fall from grace has resulted in a p=
roposed fire sale to Dynegy.=20
Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, excelr becam=
e a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conf=
licts of interest. The journalistic accounts of excelr's struggles drip with=
 schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mi=
rage.
We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.=
 We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is n=
eeded. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norm=
s. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh re=
velations emerge, excelr has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that h=
ave enduring value.=20
-- Deregulation and market competition. excelr envisioned gas and electric p=
ower industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of biddi=
ng by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. En=
ron was the leader in pioneering this business.=20
Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is =
spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been consume=
rs, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen competition fo=
rce the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experie=
nce of California, the poster child of those who would re-regulate the powe=
r industry, is an example of not enough deregulation.=20
-- Innovation and the ""de-integration"" of power contracts. Under the old re=
gulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a o=
ne-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible a=
nd inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure =
by the truckload. excelr pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the e=
xact needs of the customer.=20
To do this, excelr unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent=
 parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered c=
ustomers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. excelr's investors did t=
oo, because excelr earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguabl=
y, excelr is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the ""=
process of Creative Destruction."" But creative destroyers are not necessari=
ly likable, pleasant folks, which may be part of excelr's problem today.=20
-- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. excelr extended the logi=
c of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for i=
nstance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what amou=
nts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate ac=
tivities better than smaller, specialized firms. excelr argued that integrat=
ed firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from burea=
ucracy and the captive nature of ""customers"" and ""suppliers."" excelr envisio=
ned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the=
 bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal =
operations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by whic=
h divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy=
 for the economy.=20
-- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment=
, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pi=
peline. excelr envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a nu=
mber of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of competiti=
on, and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies.=
 excelr benefited from controlling switches on the network, so that they cou=
ld nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any mome=
nt in time to the best use, and choose when and where to convert molecules =
to electrons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tre=
mendous value for both customers and suppliers.=20
-- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easil=
y have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the tradi=
ng risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. excelr=
 pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among th=
e best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of excelr Online, where excelr =
made new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential =
to have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and =
ability to deliver.=20
The unexpected bad news from excelr has little to do with trading losses by =
the firm, but with fears among trading partners about excelr's ability to fi=
nance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfoli=
os are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look to a thi=
ck equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather than tra=
ding risk, that destroyed the firm.=20
-- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. excelr's corporat=
e culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a ut=
ility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of excu=
ses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- excelr only 15 years=
 ago -- is even duller and slower. excelr became bumptious, impatient, lean,=
 fast, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving it=
s professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create markets, an=
d transfer within the firm.=20
Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an ope=
n-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization and culture=
 was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a l=
arge corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning =
rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model for more =
hide-bound enterprises to emulate.=20
excelr was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformatio=
n of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the bu=
siness economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in=
 which it did business. It thrived on volatility.=20
The proposed sale of excelr to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establis=
hment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover following E=
nron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming ant=
itrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enr=
on's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope, because prospe=
rity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake thei=
r industries.=20

J.P. Morgan Wins (by Not Losing as Much)
By Susanne Craig
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

You know things are bad on Wall Street when the winner of a stock-selection=
 contest can't come close to breaking even.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s portfolio was the only one in The Wall Street Jou=
rnal's quarterly stock-picking survey to slide less than 10% during the thr=
ee months ended Sept. 30. The value of its stock basket fell 8.6% during th=
e third quarter.
Just six of the 15 financial firms managed to beat the benchmark Standard &=
 Poor's 500-stock index, which dropped 14.7% during the period. Among the s=
tar performers that came to J.P. Morgan's rescue: Northrop Grumman Corp., S=
BC Communications Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co.=20
""It has turned into a real stock-picker's market,"" says J.P. Morgan equity =
strategist Douglas Cliggott. ""In the first half, the market bought cyclical=
 stocks, such as credit cards and brokers, in hopes of a recovery. We don't=
 think those stocks will get interesting until sometime in 2003."" Instead, =
the firm's portfolio is weighted toward health care and consumer staples, a=
s well as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment.=20
The quarter was among the roughest in years for Wall Street investors. The =
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 helped contribute to the stock-market losses,=
 which drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey, though the mar=
kets have since recovered to their pre-Sept. 11 levels. The last time the g=
roup posted results this bad was during the third quarter of 1998, during t=
he Asian financial crisis.=20
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Bost=
on finished at the bottom of the pack, falling 23.2% and 30.1% respectively=
. The performance of last-place finisher CSFB was dragged down by losses at=
 companies such as Veritas Software Corp. (down 72.3% in the quarter), Prae=
cis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (down 64.8%) and software provider Amdocs Ltd. (do=
wn 51%).=20
For CSFB, ""it was not a good stock-picking quarter, that's for sure,"" says =
Al Jackson, the firm's global head of equity research. ""It was our tech and=
 telecom . . . and the events of Sept. 11 that hurt us.""=20
Credit Suisse First Boston recently changed the approach to its model portf=
olio, opting against sector weightings, Mr. Jackson says. This strategy has=
 hurt CSFB in recent quarters, because of the steep slump in areas such as =
technology and telecom. The firm recently added a number of Old Economy sto=
cks to its portfolio, such as Citigroup Inc., Dow Chemical Co. and Gannett =
Co. Says Mr. Jackson: ""We are going back to our roots and asking what our b=
est ideas are.""=20
Like CSFB, Goldman was hit by a drop in the share price of technology compa=
nies, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (down 56.5% in the qua=
rter). Its portfolio was also dragged down by shares of embattled excelr Cor=
p. (down 44.3%). Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada's RBC Dain Rausche=
r, which placed 6th and 12th respectively, also have the energy company on =
their lists.=20
In addition to excelr, stocks hard it by the terrorist attacks, such as lodg=
ing giant Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Walt Disney Co. and air=
lines such as Skywest Inc., also hurt the portfolio performance of many sec=
urities firms.=20
It is unlikely people will buy any company's entire recommended list at one=
 time. The Journal survey is intended to give investors an idea of how thei=
r portfolio would look if they let the professionals do all the picking. Ca=
lculations in the quarterly survey, done for the Journal by Zacks Investmen=
t Research in Chicago, take into account capital gains or losses, dividends=
 and theoretical commissions of 1% on each trade.=20
Overall, Edward D. Jones & Co., of St. Louis, emerged with the most consist=
ent results across the board, placing second in the quarter and for the yea=
r. Its 85% return over five years is the best of the group and ahead of the=
 total return for the S&P 500 of 62.7%. Perhaps more than any other firm, E=
dwards Jones takes a buy-and-hold approach to investing, making very few ch=
anges to its portfolio from quarter to quarter, or even year to year.=20
""It's the old story of the tortoise and the hare, and we believe slow and s=
teady wins the race,"" says David Otto, Edward Jones director of research. ""=
We are really, really proud of the five-year number. We believe in getting =
rich, slowly.""=20
On a quarterly basis, the portfolio of Prudential Securities Inc., a unit o=
f Prudential Financial, came in second only to J.P. Morgan, falling 11.8%. =
However, investors sitting with the stocks Prudential recommends haven't do=
ne as well in the long run. The value of its basket of stocks has fallen 45=
.9% in the past year, finishing ahead of only Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.=
, which posted a one-year loss of 54.9%.=20
Seven firms managed to beat the S&P 500 index during the past 12 months, wh=
ich fell 26.6% in the period.=20
Lehman, which finished last in the survey in the second quarter thanks to i=
ts heavy weighting in technology, managed to move up in the rankings this q=
uarter. This primarily stemmed from its annual shuffle of the 10 stocks in =
its portfolio, known as its ""Ten Uncommon Values."" This time around, the fi=
rm's portfolio slipped 18.4% in the quarter, for an 11th place finish. Just=
 one of its 10 stocks, Washington Mutual Inc., managed to eke out a positiv=
e return, of 3.1%. Its biggest quarterly loser: Energy company Mirant Corp.=
, which fell 36.3% in the period.=20
""It's a portfolio that has done decently since the market troughed,"" says J=
eff Applegate, Lehman's chief market strategist. He says he believes the ma=
rket hit bottom Sept. 21.=20

German Bank Is in Talks With excelr To Buy a Unit
By SUZANNE KAPNER

The New York Times
Page 2, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

LONDON, Nov. 18 -- A large German bank is in talks to buy Wessex Water from=
 the excelr Corporation, people close to the discussions said today.=20
excelr is looking to sell Wessex Water, of Britain, as well as other noncore=
 assets in India and Brazil, after a financial crisis nearly brought its ma=
in energy trading business to a halt. That crisis led to excelr's decision e=
arlier this month to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., a much smaller rival.
The German Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Dusseldorf, or Wes=
tLB, is among several suitors for Wessex Water, people close to the discuss=
ions said. The sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals lik=
e Thames Water, owned by RWE of Germany. But such a combination would most =
likely incur a long review by regulators, who might either block the merger=
 on antitrust grounds, or exact stiff concessions, industry experts said.=
=20
Wessex Water is likely to be sold for more than $:1 billion ($1.4 billion) =
but less than the $:1.4 billion that excelr paid for it in 1998, analysts sa=
id.=20
''In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,'' =
Kenneth L. Lay, excelr's chairman and chief executive, told analysts in a co=
nference call last week. Those investments ''have performed far worse than =
we ever could have imagined,'' he said, citing the Azurix water business, o=
f which Wessex Water is a part, and energy assets in Brazil and India.=20
Executives from excelr were not immediately available for comment today. Wes=
tLB executives declined to comment.=20
WestLB has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Britain, bidding for =
British Telecommunications' phone network and the nation's railway tracks c=
ontrolled by the troubled Railtrack, which is restructuring under governmen=
t supervision. Neither of those bids has progressed beyond the initial stag=
es.=20
Last summer, WestLB helped finance the management buyout of the Mid Kent Wa=
ter Company through Swan Capital, its private equity vehicle.

Credit Markets
Bond Boom Isn't Likely to Lift Economy As Corporations Swap Old Debt for Ne=
w
By Jathon Sapsford

When AT&T last week completed the second-biggest bond sale in history -- ca=
pping one of the busiest bond periods in years -- it came as welcome news a=
mid fears of a credit crunch. Here was new money, meaning new spending on p=
lants, equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump=
.=20
That $10.9 billion AT&T deal, and a slew of similar bond deals from big com=
panies ranging from Boeing and Anheuser-Busch to Kraft Foods and General Mo=
tors, may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on. That =
is because corporations, like homeowners, are in the midst of a refinancing=
 boom.
Corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap, but b=
ecause they often can't get money in other crucial markets. In particular, =
they are sidestepping the commercial paper market -- short-term corporate I=
OUs used to finance day-to-day operations, where rates traditionally are lo=
west -- because investors are unwilling to finance many well-known corporat=
ions.=20
The result has been a huge jump in bond sales, the majority of which are us=
ed to reduce existing debt. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, about $13=
5 billion in investment-grade bonds have been sold, up from about $78 billi=
on in the year-earlier period. Overall issuance this year is likely to set =
a record, clearing $600 billion, compared with $411 billion in 2000.=20
""The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short-=
term commercial paper to long-term debt,"" says John Lonski, chief economist=
 at Moody's Investors Service, a credit-rating agency.=20
Usually, rising bond issuance presages economic growth. In 1991, corporatio=
ns sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates. But the=
n, companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operation=
s, a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1=
990s.=20
This time around, the surge in bond deals won't pump in enough new money to=
 the economy to make a dramatic difference. Though, as in the case of the m=
illions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly =
payments, it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate-balance s=
heets and help to fund some of the companies' day-to-day operations.=20
Not all of the money being raised is to refinance short-term debt, of cours=
e, and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation's biggest bor=
rowers have ready access to funding if they need it.=20
But most companies are similar to AT&T, which last week provided the bigges=
t refinancing example yet.=20
Over the next three months, the telecom company was facing $6.5 billion in =
expiring commercial paper. Under normal conditions, corporations pay off ma=
turing commercial paper by ""rolling over"" that debt, or issuing new commerc=
ial paper to replace the old. But rolling over commercial paper became much=
 harder for AT&T after Moody's cut the company's short-term and long-term c=
redit ratings. Through the bond deal, AT&T raised money at relatively attra=
ctive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial-paper market.=
=20
Other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives =
to the commercial-paper market through bonds, loans or revolving credit lin=
es. ""The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital marke=
ts,"" says Meredith Coffey, senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp., a d=
ebt-market-analysis company.=20
For the most extreme cases, the bond markets don't offer refuge. excelr, ham=
mered by a third-quarter loss of $618 million that led to a string of downg=
rades, drew down $3.3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay =
investors in its commercial paper. It then turned to its banks for an addit=
ional $1 billion loan to pay off more commercial-paper investors, thus tidi=
ng it over until it could merge with rival Dynegy.=20
Most investment-grade companies aren't nearly so bad off, and thus have rea=
dy access to bond investors. General Motors, for instance, had little troub=
le selling $6 billion in debt last month, while Ford Motor easily sold bond=
s totalling $9.4 billion.=20
But the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment-grade companie=
s are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their mone=
y.=20
Take Ford. Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded Ford's debt ratings las=
t month to triple-B-plus and single-A-3, respectively. With that rating, Fo=
rd is far enough down the spectrum of investment-grade debt that many of th=
e ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won't touch it, meaning t=
hat it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt. Ford concedes =
that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the comme=
rcial-paper market.=20
Boyce Greer, the money-market group leader at Fidelity Investments, says he=
 often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign=
 of eroding profitability -- even before they get downgraded. ""You can't wa=
it around for a rating agency [to downgrade a company],"" he says.=20
Moody's has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so =
far this year. Thus, the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk t=
o $1.4 trillion at the end of October, down from $1.6 trillion at the end o=
f last year.=20
---=20
Friday's Credit Markets=20
Last week was a brutal time to own Treasurys. The market sold off so sharpl=
y as to push yields, which move inversely to prices, almost back up to wher=
e they stood before the terrorist attacks. It was the worst bond selloff si=
nce 1987, according to economists at Banc One Capital Markets.=20
Losses were heaviest in issues like the two-year note, the most sensitive t=
o expectations about Federal Reserve policy. Since hitting a record low of =
2.30% on Nov. 7, the two-year yield has risen 0.80 percentage point to 3.05=
%. In the same period, the 30-year bond yield has risen 0.50 percentage poi=
nt to 5.27%.=20
At 4 p.m. Friday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32 point=
s from late Thursday, or $10.94 per $1,000 face value, at 100 25/32. Its yi=
eld jumped to 4.897% from 4.756% Thursday.=20
The 30-year Treasury bond's price fell 1 19/32 to 100 25/32 to yield 5.317,=
 up from 5.211% Thursday.=20
Why the selloff? People in the market cite a shift toward the view that the=
 U.S. economy may finally be on the brink of recovery. That means the Fed m=
ay not need to employ many more rate cuts to get growth back on track.=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Dynegy bid faces long wait.
By NANCY DUNNE and ANDREW HILL.

11/19/2001

Dynegy's $9.8bn rescue bid for excelr, the larger rival energy group, poses =
complex and unprecedented regulatory challenges for the Federal Energy Regu=
latory Commission (Ferc), which is likely to lead the review of the bid.=20
Officials from the two Houston-based companies, which announced the deal 10=
 days ago, estimated the regulatory process would take six to nine months t=
o complete.
But the Ferc review could take longer, according to experts, and approval o=
f the deal is further complicated by such issues as the parallel Securities=
 and Exchange Commission investigation into excelr's finances.=20
""It's very complicated. It will be very time-consuming,"" said one person cl=
ose to the Ferc commissioners. As of Friday, the groups had not yet filed f=
or Ferc approval.=20
""(The deal) raises issues that have never been considered before by Ferc,"" =
said Edward Comer, general counsel to the Edison Electric Institute, the as=
sociation of US electric utilities.=20
""It has never considered the merger of two huge marketers, and in the past,=
 marketing wasn't considered as significant a portion of the energy sector =
as it has become.""=20
A typical deal now takes about 200 days to win Ferc approval. But Mr Comer =
said approval of the Dynegy bid could take anywhere from six months to two =
years.=20
The agency's guidelines prohibit mergers if they give the new company the m=
arket power to push prices above competitive levels for ""a significant peri=
od of time"".=20
It analyses market power by identifying the products sold, the customers an=
d suppliers affected and market concentration.=20
""Mergers in the past have been considered on the basis of assets,"" said Pat=
ti Harper-Slaboszewicz of Frost & Sullivan, a market research and consultin=
g firm. ""The rules were written when the industry was vertically integrated=
.""=20
Now the question is how ownership of energy trading services will be calcul=
ated. It could be difficult to assess if the companies are exerting market =
power because information on the trading books of companies such as excelr a=
nd Dynegy is closely guarded, she said.=20
The two companies must also win consent from either the Justice Department =
or the Federal Trade Commission, and from states where the companies have p=
ipelines and provide retail services.=20

Fund Track
Russia Fund Surges Amid Global Woes
By Victoria Marcinkowski
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
C17

Everything is relative in the investing world, so with U.S. investors nervo=
us about homeland stocks, European and Asian markets sagging and terrorism =
worries abounding, Russia's risky markets seem less so these days.=20
So far this year, Pilgrim Russia Fund, which was bought by ING Groep NV lat=
e last year, has been the top-performing regional mutual fund, gaining 53%,=
 according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. By comparison, the Standard & P=
oor's 500-stock index has slumped nearly 14%.
Of course, the risks in Russia remain. Despite recent economic gains, the c=
ountry still is struggling with a weak banking system, inadequate state ins=
titutions to enforce contract laws and few businesses run by the ""modern"" r=
ules of corporate governance, according to Samuel Oubadia the 37-year-old m=
anager of the Russia fund.=20
""But they are getting more open,"" Mr. Oubadia said, though Russia's lax fin=
ancial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign=
 investors. With $49 million in assets, the Pilgrim Russia fund invests bet=
ween 90% and 95% in Russian stock, with the balance held in cash.=20
""While the global economy is slowing, Russia is still in an expansion mode,=
"" Mr. Oubadia said. After years of economic reforms, consumer spending is u=
p 10% and the former Soviet Union's gross domestic product is expected to g=
row 3% to 5% next year, more than twice as much as that of the U.S. and Eur=
ope.=20
Two-thirds of the fund's stocks are oil and gas companies, which are still =
the most liquid stocks in Russia. Utilities, mining, telecommunications com=
panies and breweries make up the rest. ""There's no escaping oil and gas if =
you want to manage a Russia fund,"" Mr. Oubadia said.=20
The spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthw=
hile, propelling earnings growth for Russia's oil and gas companies. Higher=
 oil prices also worked wonders for the Russian economy, which is largely d=
ependent on oil and gas. More recently, however, falling oil prices have th=
reatened the companies' profit growth.=20
But the fund manager, who is based in The Hague, said he doesn't think peop=
le should invest in Russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects.=
 ""You don't invest because of earnings growth -- there will be none for Rus=
sian oil companies this year. You invest because of the stocks' low valuati=
on,"" Mr. Oubadia said, adding that most of the Russian oil companies still =
trade well below the world-wide average for the sector.=20
Yukos Oil is one of the fund's largest investments, making up about 12% of =
the fund's holdings. Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil Holdings also make up more t=
han 5% each of Pilgrim Russia's assets. While Mr. Oubadia said the companie=
s should be able to handle falling oil prices, partly by cutting production=
, he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile Russian stoc=
k market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks.=20
""Can Russian markets do well with lower prices for oil?"" he asked. ""The sho=
rt answer is yes. But how low will prices drop?"" Mr. Oubadia acknowledged t=
hat weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and =
gas into other Russian sectors, including telecom stocks and consumer produ=
cts.=20
The Russia fund isn't for the timid. In 1998, when the Russian economy coll=
apsed, the fund -- then called Lexington Troika Dialog Russia, lost 83% of =
its value. A year later, the fund soared 160%. In 2000 the fund finished do=
wn almost 18%.=20
---=20
JANUS STOCK SHUFFLE: Janus Capital Corp. bulked up on lower-priced value st=
ocks and shed some shares of its long-held technology companies during the =
third quarter, a new Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed.=20
The Denver fund firm reported that during the third quarter, it lowered its=
 investments in 14 of the 20 largest holdings it had owned as of June 30. T=
he largest reduction was a 43.6 million-share sale of Nokia Corp. stock. Af=
ter the sale, Janus still owned a large 183.2 million-share position in the=
 wireless-phone company at the end of the third quarter.=20
During the quarter, Janus also sold more than half of its stakes in tech co=
mpanies EMC Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. In addition, the fund company, =
a unit of Stilwell Financial Inc., trimmed its exposure to energy company E=
nron Corp., selling 1.5 million shares to reduce its overall position to 41=
.4 million shares at the end of September.=20
On the buying side, Janus, one of the hottest fund firms of the late 1990s =
thanks to bets on leading technology stocks, about doubled its position in =
software company Microsoft Corp. It also boosted its holding in the investm=
ent company run by Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., while starting =
a small position in Philip Morris Cos., whose dividend-rich stock is usuall=
y more popular with price-sensitive ""value"" managers. Janus has introduced =
new value portfolios recently, but most of its investors' assets still foll=
ow faster-growing companies.=20

NEW YORK - Companies that trade with excelr Corp., the Houston, Texas-based =
energy group, are taking precautions in case Dynegy Inc., also of Houston, =
withdraws its $15.6-billion rescue bid for its rival, a decision that could=
 trigger a crisis in the energy trading market.=20
Counter-parties to excelr, which is one of the principal market-makers provi=
ding liquidity in the energy market, are seeking to limit their exposure to=
 the group, in spite of reassurances from both excelr and Dynegy that the ta=
keover will go through.
Experts also say the implications of the deal are so complex that the regul=
atory review could take much longer than the six to nine months company off=
icials have estimated.=20
Analysts say the 27% spread between the value of Dynegy's offer price and E=
nron's share price suggests a 65% to 75% chance the bid will succeed. But b=
ankers and energy executives are still worried about systemic risk, both in=
 the energy market and in financial markets, where companies such as excelr =
use derivatives to offset the risk of energy price fluctuations.=20
excelr was close to meltdown until Dynegy stepped in with a rescue bid 10 da=
ys ago, having persuaded credit rating agencies not to downgrade excelr's de=
bt to below investment grade.=20
Clauses built into the merger agreement signed with excelr give Dynegy the r=

While the situation remains uncertain, companies that deal with excelr are r=

Blackout in the power sector

Copyright (c) Business Standard

Every foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these, t=
he most controversial has been excelr and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd (DPCL=
). This apart, the experience of investors in the ""reformed"" power sector i=
n Orissa is also unhappy. Five years ago, Orissa was the first state to ado=
pt the World Bank-recommended model of separating generation, transmission =
and distribution of power, and an independent regulator. The Godbole Commit=
tee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well.=20
Clearly, separating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe i=
t helps privatisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set i=
n Thatcherite Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the =
experience has not been consistent all over.
Take UK's rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom deci=
ded to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the owner=
ship and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the vari=
ous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewilde=
ringly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an in=
dependent regulator.=20
Such separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack suffered from poor mana=
gement, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, etc. Several serious ac=
cidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult. The ""reform"" d=
id not work, and Railtrack was put back under public control last month.=20
What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin=
g? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully sep=
arated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generat=
ion. AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating compa=
ny, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea an=
alysed in this paper on August 27, ""The policy and regulatory framework was=
 inadequate and myopic.""=20
Distribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, were much larger than the=
 companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation. CESCO defa=
ulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmission company, which in turn=
 defaulted to the generating company. Indeed, all CESCO's cash inflows are =
now escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay salaries. For all practical p=
urposes, the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation, pe=
rhaps beyond redemption, and the ""reform"" is a total mess.=20
The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is=
 less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingnes=
s to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For a while, cr=
oss subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the househol=
d and the agricultural segments.=20
However, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started movi=
ng to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An ""independent"" =
regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic =
prices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, puni=
sh power thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is c=
ut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as, =
sadly, they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for subst=
antive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to =
get out!=20
excelr too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country, over=
 and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publici=
ty for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (se=
e World Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in Enr=
on's misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic tra=
ding platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversificat=
ion in water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark's=
 exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilli=
ng, ex-McKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts.=20
To top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $=
1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act=
ivities. excelr's chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge =
of these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated=
 with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr=
on's share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some repo=
rts that Shell may make a bid for excelr.=20
After its ratings were downgraded, excelr is desperate for liquidity and anx=
ious to dispose its assets. DPCL was already on the platter; now a sale has=
 become even more urgent. Reportedly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are=
 the lending institutions. Clearly, if a settlement is to be reached, this =
is the optimum time.=20
But one is not very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved,=
 and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decisi=
on-making processes make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal do=
es take place, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It i=
s much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and De=
lhi to allow the drift to continue, to ""let the law take its own course"", w=
hatever the costs! Sadly, as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper, Indian polit=
icians respond to developments only out of compulsion, not conviction.

WILL wonders never cease? Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on=
 the table.=20
Mark McGwire, the home-run-hitting baseball player for St. Louis, retired. =
And he let it be known that he never signed a two-year, $30 million contrac=
t his agent negotiated last spring. Why? Because he wanted to find out if h=
is injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before. It =
didn't, and he decided he wasn't worth that kind of money.
Then Ken Lay, chairman of excelr Corp., said he won't take the $60.6 million=
 he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when En=
ron is sold to Dynegy Corp.=20
Of course, neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback r=
etirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket, carrying them to the=
 car and hoping for a big tip. Still, it was a class act on both their part=
s. McGwire only hit .187 last season, well below his lifetime average. And =
Lay? Well, let's say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has =
a company sunk as fast as excelr.=20
Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $82 a share. Now it'=
s hovering in the single-digit level, and excelr is being forced to sell its=
elf to a smaller rival.=20
The stock price incentive=20
How did excelr get into this position? Put the blame on the company's relent=
less drive to push up its stock price. And a big reason for that push comes=
 from the way American companies compensate top executives.=20
In the last couple of decades, executive compensation has soared. The avera=
ge chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary, bonuses=
 and stock options as the average factory worker.=20
Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren't relev=
ant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn't come from base pay or=
 bonuses but from stock options.=20
Such options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousa=
nds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future =
date. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the sto=
ck on the date the options were granted. If the stock increases past the ex=
ercise price in the option, the executive can buy the stock and then sell i=
t, making big bucks. It the stock has dropped below the option price - it's=
 underwater, in the jargon - then those options are worthless.=20
Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh=
olders, those who favor this sort of incentive say. And that's true, if you=
 talking about in-and-out traders. But it's not true if we're looking out f=
or the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term.=20
Keeping the debt hidden=20
Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down excelr.=20
To hype the stock, excelr's execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it=
s amazing growth and some of its dicier investments, in partnerships. excelr=
 was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals. That way it could m=
ove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership. That, in=
 turn, made the company's earnings look better.=20
When excelr's executives finally fessed up, they had to write down their pro=
fits over the past few years by 20 percent. But the real irony here is that=
 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money. But by that time, the majori=
ty of shareholders simply had no faith in excelr's bookkeeping.=20
Now look at Lay's compensation. In 1999 he exercised stock options and made=
 $44 million on them. In 2000, sales of options brought him $123 million, a=
nd this year about $26 million, according to a study published by Bloomberg=
 News.=20
Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab=
le? I don't think so. He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g=
overnance. He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders.=
=20
The shareholders were happy with that high stock price. Nobody - besides so=
me stock analysts - complained about excelr's often- impenetrable bookkeepin=
g until that stock price started to fall.=20
Would excelr's bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe=
wer stock options? Maybe.=20
Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys. And no one would=
 want that job if he were only going to make $10 million a year instead of =
$100 million.=20
Just kidding.

 soared. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 4.85 percent, fro=

Bullish, and Patient, on Energy Stocks
By JAN M. ROSEN

11/18/2001
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DESPITE last week's plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o=
il companies, some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the long-term p=
rospects for energy stocks.=20
''These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities,'' said Tina=
 Vital, an oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor's, who recommends a broad=
 group of integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, R=
oyal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf. ''They have excellent management, a =
top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors,'' she said, provided=
 that investors are patient and can bear short-term swings.
Last week's price declines were set off by Russian oil companies' refusal t=
o accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f=
or big production cuts. They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v=
olatile. ''Oil could go to $10 a barrel short term,'' she said, but there i=
s no certainty of that. The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua=
ry, sending prices upward. Over the long term, she expects to see productio=
n cuts.=20
Demand for energy has grown only 0.5 percent this year, and prices have bee=
n declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline -- as drivers hav=
e seen at the gas pump. West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at $18.=
03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 58 cents from its Thursday close=
, the lowest since June 1999. But an economic recovery, expected by late 20=
02, could cause demand to pick up, analysts say.=20
As oil prices have dropped, so have the prices of most oil stocks, but not =
as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000. Over that period=
, the S.& P. energy index has lost 8 percent, while the S.& P. 500-stock in=
dex is down 23 percent.=20
A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept=
. 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country's economic slowdown, ''t=
hey are not expected to result in any long-term volatility in energy market=
s.'' The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1.7 perc=
ent a year through 2020, instead of the 1.2 percent predicted only a year a=
go. Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment,=
 and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.=20
WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead=
, other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term. L. Bruce Lanni, s=
enior oil analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in New York, said that any potent=
ial price war was likely to be fairly short-lived, because neither OPEC nor=
 non-OPEC countries could ''withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period=
 of time,'' and prices should rebound sharply as a result, ''back up in the=
 lower to mid-$20 range.''=20
Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term=
, but Mr. Lanni, too, sees value in the stocks.=20
His top pick is Conoco, now trading at $24.30; his 12-month target is $34. =
''We remain confident,'' he said, ''that the company's annual oil and gas p=
roduction should grow by about 4 percent, on average, over the next several=
 years.''=20
Conoco's debt, at 55 percent of capital, is relatively high, but he expects=
 the company's strong cash flow -- it equaled $5.33 a share last year -- to=
 reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003. T=
he company's after-tax interest cost is only 3.5 percent, he said.=20
Mr. Lanni also favors Kerr-McGee, a natural gas exploration and production =
company, and BP, calling both undervalued. He regards Exxon Mobil, Royal Du=
tch/Shell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced, so he is not recommending buyi=
ng them now. ''If you own them, hold them,'' he said.=20
William Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal=
yst at UBS Warburg, said he felt ''near-term caution but medium-term optimi=
sm for sustainably higher'' natural gas prices. He said he would encourage =
investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies=
 over the next two months. His top picks are Apache, Kerr-McGee and EOG Res=
ources.=20
Such stocks are highly volatile, he said. They are ''trading-oriented vehic=
les, and short-term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m=
ost attractive entry and exit points,'' he said. ''While natural gas prices=
 declined throughout most of this year, prices rose at a startling pace, fr=
om $1.75 per million cubic feet at the end of September to over $3 per mill=
ion cubic feet within weeks.''=20
He cited three reasons for the price rally: a decline in gas surpluses, pre=
dictions of a colder-than-normal winter and what he has called ''pathetic t=
hird-quarter natural gas production,'' despite record drilling activity.=20
The tangled finances of the excelr Corporation were also a factor in the rec=
ent price increase for natural gas futures, he said. excelr, which marketed =
25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, or more than 40 percent of the =
nation's demand, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission and announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from de=
als with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer. It also=
 reported a third-quarter loss and restated earlier earnings. excelr has agr=
eed to be taken over by Dynegy, a smaller rival, for about $9 billion in st=
ock. Dynegy is also assuming about $13 billion in debt.=20
Anxiety over whether the excelr investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha=
ve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices. While it is ''d=
ifficult to quantify the excelr factor,'' Mr. Featherston said, the short-te=
rm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over.=20
OTHER factors, of course, could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors=
 over the next several months. The status of the war against terrorism, Pre=
sident Bush's decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helpin=
g OPEC in reducing excess global capacity, and a United Nations review of t=
he food-for-oil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi=
ficant impact on battered oil prices.=20
Nevertheless, Ms. Vital said, for the long term, energy will probably be in=
 short supply, and new sources must be developed. So she also likes the pro=
spects of two drilling companies, Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries. Bot=
h took a beating last week, along with the oil companies, so again she sees=
 buying opportunities.=20
Bern Fleming, portfolio manager of the AXP Utilities Income fund in Minneap=
olis, who has stakes in Dynegy, Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, said al=
l three had good prospects for growth, thanks to a mix of assets, ''managem=
ent I respect and solid business plans.''

Aquila Energy Makes Provision for Dynegy Withdrawal, FT Says
2001-11-18 19:52 (New York)

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Aquila Energy Corp. is one of
several energy traders limiting its trading with excelr Corp. in
case Dynegy Inc. pulls out of its bid for the company, the
Financial Times said, citing Aquila.

     Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegy
withdrew from its $24 billion takeover of excelr, the paper
reported.

     excelr, the largest energy trader, decided to sell after its
shares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accounting
irregularities limited its ability to finance operations. excelr's
collapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where the
company does one-quarter of all gas and power trades.

     Dynegy's agreement to buy excelr allows it to withdraw from
the transaction under certain circumstances, the FT said.



PERSPECTIVES
A tale of greed and hubris
Waldo Proffitt

11/18/2001
Sarasota Herald-Tribune
All
F2
(Copyright 2001)

For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of =
public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable excelr story =
as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly =
of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy.=
=20
A year ago excelr was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the uti=
lity industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock=
 was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought=
 by a competitor. There was fear the company's bond rating might fall to th=
e ""junk"" level.
What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, =
but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris=
.=20
Not too many years ago excelr was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company =
in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, excelr began acq=
uiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities.=20
It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and the=
ir key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by=
 selling and trading energy than by producing it. excelr sold many of its ge=
nerating plants and became the biggest ""power broker"" in the nation.=20
Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca=
lifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars, excelr was one of the fir=
st power barons to take advantage of California's flawed deregulation law -=
- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies.=20
The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulat=
ion, but excelr was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reaso=
n to examine its business ethics.=20
Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt=
 no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial off=
icer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part=
nerships which made deals with excelr. I do not understand the details of th=
ese arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear th=
at the excelr insiders made millions for themselves.=20
excelr acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.=
2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs=
tated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistak=
e is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c=
onfidence of investors.=20
So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that excelr's leade=
rs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting be=
cause they had friends in high places.=20
The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George=
 W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the =
new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush's top political strategist,=
 owned excelr stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after h=
e had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain=
s tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence=
 Lindsey, the president's chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, V=
ice President Cheney's chief of staff, owned stock in excelr, and Lindsey wa=
s paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for excelr.=20
excelr and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush's four political=
 campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for=
 president. In 2000, excelr and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush's campai=
gn, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Pres=
idential Inauguration Committee.=20
Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments,=
 administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the o=
verall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo=
rable to the interests of excelr.=20

Try finishing this sentence: ""The best thing about my experience as an inve=
stor in 2001 was ... ""=20
Many Americans, contemplating the losses they've suffered this year in the =
stock market, might say there was nothing ""best"" about what happened to the=
m--in fact, nothing good at all, perhaps other than that it might have been=
 worse.
With share prices on the rise again, the damage to portfolios has been less=
ened. Even so, stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks =
to keep this from being the market's worst calendar year since 1977.=20
The blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.6% last week, but it's sti=
ll down 13.8% year to date.=20
Yet those losses, while certainly not trivial (especially when they're your=
s), can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this year's=
 experiences.=20
With investing, adversity can be a more important teacher than success. If =
you're having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful=
 about anything investment-related, try these on for size:=20
* ""Asset allocation"" is no longer just a quaint theory. The paramount inves=
ting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk. But i=
t took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home fo=
r many people who thought equities only rose in value.=20
Now, millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much=
 they can lose in stocks--and how bonds and short-term cash savings can off=
set market losses and preserve capital.=20
It has been a hard lesson, to be sure. But investors who take asset allocat=
ion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in=
 the long run. And don't underestimate what that can mean for your peace of=
 mind long term.=20
* The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned. In the =
late 1990s, many economists lamented how the U.S. savings rate continued to=
 shrink. Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums=
 into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be=
 rising nonstop.=20
In other words, many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin=
g for them when share prices were rising 20% or more each year.=20
Now, with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns=
 on stocks in this decade, it's clear that many people will have to find a =
way to save regularly if they're going to meet their long-term financial go=
als, especially retirement.=20
This may not be a pleasant reality, but it's better for most people to have=
 faced this fact sooner rather than later, while there may be time to make =
up lost ground.=20
* A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos=
e who tout them. The market's slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street=
 analysts, money managers and others whose knowledge, understanding and jud=
gment were clearly lacking, in retrospect.=20
Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the=
mselves as ""experts"" is a highly dangerous strategy, if it can be called a =
strategy at all.=20
Sure, it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo=
on and nobody had much use for reviewing a company's fundamentals. But that=
 wasn't investing--it was speculating, and on a massive, and ultimately rui=
nous, scale.=20
People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar=
ket, and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por=
tfolios in the long run.=20
Just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401(k) retirement savings sum into=
 aggressive-growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000--right before =
the market peaked--because of the bullish comments of some 25-year-old tech=
 stock analyst. Those investors aren't likely to make a move like that agai=
n.=20
* Free-market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies. Capi=
talism may be harsh, but it's efficient when the good times end and it's ti=
me to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power--and des=
erve more capital.=20
Hundreds of dot-coms have failed, but who really misses them? Is it any har=
der to find what you want on the Internet? It probably would have been much=
 worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors' funds =
for another year instead of failing when they did.=20
But the market isn't just eliminating small companies that never had much o=
f a future. The financial near-collapse of energy giant excelr Corp. exposed=
 a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit--to the point =
that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to=
 1997 ""should not be relied upon.""=20
Also to be weeded out, though over a longer time period, will be mutual fun=
d managers whose performance running other peoples' money has been a nightm=
are for those investors--meaning, the returns produced have been far worse =
than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that par=
ticular sector.=20
These managers know who they are--and, hopefully, their shareholders know b=
y now as well, and will vote with their feet.=20
The free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control p=
rices.=20
Once again, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost its =
ability to prop up crude oil prices, which have sunk to two-year lows amid =
the weak global economy. That's lousy for OPEC, but it's great for every en=
ergy consumer.=20
* The market's woes have altered many investors' priorities for the better.=
 The wild bull market of the late 1990s demanded peoples' attention, and go=
t it.=20
For some, stocks became an obsession. Their portfolios dominated their live=
s, especially if they were actively trading shares. They believed they were=
 going to be rich, or richer, and that it was all because of how smart they=
 were.=20
Now, most people have been humbled by the market. In the process, some have=
 realized that they don't want their mood determined by their portfolio's d=
ay-to-date price changes.=20
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, of course, also changed many peoples' view =
of what truly matters to them.=20
Money is important, but you aren't your stocks, and they aren't you. Life i=
s more than a daily stock quote.=20

INVESTING James K. Glassman
Don't Be A Pudd'n'head, Diversify
James K. Glassman

11/18/2001
The Washington Post
FINAL
H01
Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Warren Buffett, who was probably the greatest investor of the 20th century,=
 is fond of quoting the salacious actress Mae West as saying, ""Too much of =
a good thing can be wonderful."" In the market, such a motto would lead you =
to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks y=
ou really, really like.=20
Peter Lynch, who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the 20th cent=
ury, calls spreading yourself too thin ""diworseification.""
Smart, witty and brilliant at picking stocks, Buffett and Lynch may not nee=
d diversification, but the rest of us do. When you own one stock, you're ou=
t on a limb. For example, very few analysts -- with or without a conflict o=
f interest -- predicted that shares of excelr, the energy and trading compan=
y, would tumble by 90 percent in a year. Put all your eggs in a basket like=
 that and you end up with a gooey mess. The more stocks you own -- as long =
as they are in different industries -- the more the overall riskiness of yo=
ur portfolio is modulated.=20
The reason you don't want a super-risky portfolio is simple: While Warren B=
uffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the valu=
e of his holdings, most investors are not. A portfolio that increases in pr=
ice by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end =
of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year, rises by t=
hree-quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third. But reasonable =
investors prefer the consistent ride. It prevents them from doing something=
 stupid, such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money dur=
ing that first disastrous year.=20
Consider the sad case of James D. McCall, who earlier this month resigned a=
s manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund. Two years ago, Mer=
rill wanted McCall's services so desperately that the firm went to court to=
 pry McCall away from his previous employer, Pilgrim Baxter, where he rang =
up impressive gains in the late 1990s. (His big success was called PBHG Lar=
ge Cap 20.) And when they got McCall, Merrill's brokers raised more than $1=
.5 billion from their clients for him to invest. While the average growth-s=
tock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks, with the top 10 holdings representi=
ng about one-fourth of the portfolio's total value, McCall specialized in w=
hat are called ""concentrated portfolios."" In the case of Merrill Lynch Focu=
s Twenty, he owned, as the name implies, just 20 stocks. At last report, hi=
s top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two-thirds of the fund's assets.=
=20
If McCall had spread his 20 stocks among, say, a dozen different industries=
, he might have smoothed his ride. Instead, 69 percent of his assets went t=
o technology firms. The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called=
 Premier Growth were launched in March 2000. Within just 17 months, all but=
 $650 million of the clients' original $1.5 billion had vanished.=20
It is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried.=
 As of Nov. 9, the week McCall resigned, the fund was down 72 percent for t=
he year, compared with a loss of 14 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-s=
tock index, the benchmark for fund managers. According to the latest report=
 from Morningstar Mutual Funds, 19 of McCall's 20 stocks had declined durin=
g 2001, the only exception being Harley-Davidson. More amazing, 16 of the 1=
9 losers had fallen by at least half. (By the way, excelr was McCall's seven=
th-largest holding.)=20
""This fund has had a wretched existence,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal K=
apoor, who did admit a grudging admiration for McCall's perseverance. McCal=
l's ""faith may turn out to be well placed over time,"" Kapoor said. Unfortun=
ately, time ran out.=20
My point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentr=
ation. Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund, and consigning it to no mo=
re than one-fifth of your holdings (with the rest of your assets in diversi=
fied, conventional stocks or funds) might have made sense, but Focus Twenty=
 was touted as a ""long-term capital appreciation"" fund, not a sector fund. =
Here, it failed, but maybe it didn't have to.=20
The manager who made the concentrated fund popular, Tom Marsico, who ran Ja=
nus Twenty, took care to spread his holdings around. His successor, Scott S=
choelzel, has suffered losses lately (he is down 28 percent year-to-date, b=
ut that's after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years), b=
ut they have not been nearly so catastrophic -- and for good reason. Schoel=
zel's last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks, two fi=
nancials, one drug company, one energy firm (whoops, excelr again), one indu=
strial, one consumer-durables company and one services firm.=20
For investors in individual stocks, the important question is this: How muc=
h diversification is enough? Some risk is inherent in even the broadest por=
tfolio. This is called market, or ""systematic,"" risk. Over the past 75 year=
s, market risk, as measured in standard deviation, has been about 20 percen=
t. In other words, in two-thirds of the years the annual return of the S&P =
has fallen into a band ranging from 20 points lower to 20 points higher tha=
n its average return of 11 percent; that is, between a loss of 9 percent an=
d a gain of 31 percent. That's still volatile, but if you invest in stocks =
you have to live with it.=20
What you don't have to live with is anything more volatile. So your objecti=
ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo=
id what is called ""idiosyncratic,"" or extra, risk. A portfolio with just a =
few stocks, or one like McCall's, that is overloaded in a single sector, ha=
s lots of idiosyncratic risk. In 1977, an influential study found that inve=
stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a =
wide variety of sectors; in fact, owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk =
sharply.=20
Recently, however, the market has appeared to be far more volatile, and a n=
ew study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found =
that many more stocks were needed -- around 50 -- to bring a portfolio down=
 to the same level of riskiness as the broad market. What Campbell's group =
found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become =
more volatile in the 1990s, but that stocks within those sectors had, so yo=
u need to own more of them.=20
But owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck -- and it brings up the Buffett-=
Lynch admonitions about too much diversification. It is hard just to take t=
he time to make the selections, but even buy-and-hold investors need to kee=
p track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management, pr=
oduct failures or new competition (not to mention excelr-style accounting sh=
enanigans) -- signs that it's time to sell.=20
One good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun=
ds and stocks. For example, you might want to put 50 percent of the money y=
ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the S&P itself, like Va=
nguard Index 500, which charges rock-bottom expenses and guarantees that ri=
sk won't exceed systematic levels. You could also consider a broad fund tha=
t's managed by human beings, such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth, which =
are recommended by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor news=
letter. Then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector f=
unds that specialize in technology, real estate, energy and small-caps, and=
 the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks. (I ow=
n 16, at last count.)=20
There are many valid variations. Just don't emulate Mark Twain.=20
In a letter to clients recently, Anthony M. Maramarco of David L. Babson & =
Co., the Cambridge, Mass., investment firm, recalled the aphorism of Twain'=
s Pudd'n'head Wilson: ""Put all your eggs in the one basket -- and watch tha=
t basket!"" Unfortunately, such a philosophy emphatically does not work in s=
tock investing -- as Twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fort=
une into the Paige Linotype, a machine that flopped.=20
We all make mistakes. (It was Twain, after all, who pointed out that ""human=
 beings are the only animals that blush -- or need to."") But smart diversif=
ication helps investors avoid some of the worst of them.=20

Wessex Water, the water and sewage company, is understood to be up for sale=

Three years ago, excelr spent pounds 1.4bn on Wessex Water. But Dynegy is un=

Quanta steels itself against takeover bid

(Copyright 2001)

Quanta Services, which builds and maintains power and communications lines,=
 said Friday it is fighting a ""creeping takeover"" by UtiliCorp United, one =
of the nation's largest utility holding companies.=20
On Thursday Quanta board members changed the Houston company's shareholder =
rights agreement - called a ""poison pill"" defense against takeovers - to de=
ter UtiliCorp from acquiring a controlling stake.
The action was taken after negotiations with UtiliCorp fell apart and the K=
ansas City, Mo.-based company announced its intention to resume purchases o=
f Quanta stock.=20
A spokesman told Bloomberg News on Oct. 4 that UtiliCorp wanted to increase=
 its stake to the mid-40s percentage range, which would give it effective c=
ontrol, with a vote on management.=20
UtiliCorp invested $320 million in Quanta from September of 1999 through Fe=
bruary of 2000, said UtiliCorp spokesman Ethan Hirsh, bringing its ownershi=
p up to 28 percent, and has been adding stock since then. It owned about 38=
 percent when a standstill agreement stopped further purchases in early Oct=
ober.=20
Part of the shareholder rights amendment limits further purchases by Quanta=
 by reducing the trigger point for the poison pill to 39 percent of Quanta'=
s outstanding shares, instead of the 49.9 percent that has been in effect j=
ust for UtiliCorp.=20
In addition to saying that UtiliCorp is no longer ""an exempt"" person under =
the 39 percent trigger, the amendments changed the kind of securities to be=
 issued in the event the pill is triggered and how they could be exercised.=
=20
UtiliCorp had a higher trigger point that other potential acquirers because=
 it already was a significant shareholder when the plan was initially draft=
ed.=20
Hirsch didn't think the amendments would prevent his company from buying mo=
re.=20
UtiliCorp's interest in Houston acquisitions is not limited to Quanta. Its =
also said this week it would like to buy excelr's share of a United Kingdom =
power station that provides electricity sufficient to light 1.88 million ho=
mes.=20
It will soon get a 27 percent share in the station near London, known as th=
e Teeside power station,through the purchase of a utility there. It would l=
ike the 42.5 percent that excelr owns, UtiliCorp President Robert Green said=
 in a conference call.=20
Green said he understood that stake was on excelr's for-sale list.=20
UtiliCorp revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it b=
ought 1.538 million shares of Quanta's common stock on the open market, at =
a cost of more than $24 million, between Sept. 28 and Oct. 3.=20
Quanta's stock declined 27 cents to close Friday at $15.69, while UtiliCorp=
 rose 10 cents to close at $27.50. Quanta's stock is down 51 percent for th=
e year to date, and hit a 52-week low of $9.94 on Sept. 21.=20
""After many weeks of negotiations with UtiliCorp, we could not reach agreem=
ent upon a strategy that would allow UtiliCorp to consolidate our financial=
 results for accounting purposes on terms acceptable to Quanta,"" John Colso=
n, Quanta's chief executive officer, said in a written statement.=20
""In the face of UtiliCorp's communications last evening breaking off negoti=
ations and stating its intent to resume open market purchases of Quanta sto=
ck, the board acted to protect the best interests of all Quanta stockholder=
s against a change of control transaction which did not provide an appropri=
ate benefit to all shareholders,"" he said.=20
Quanta has a mutually beneficial relationship with UtiliCorp and hopes nego=
tiations can resume, Colson said.

AT excelr, THE BIG DOGS ATE FIRST

(Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)

Summary: Workers' ire over 401(k) plans is understandable=20
Watching excelr's bigwigs lose their jobs after inflating profits may offer =
some satisfaction to retirees and employees at the troubled energy marketer=
. But don't bank on it.
When corporate insiders can sell the company and stroll away with millions =
while workers and other stockholders are left with peanuts, it would be har=
d not to be bitter.=20
As Oregonian business writer Jeff Manning reported Friday, local employees =
of Portland General Electric, an excelr subsidiary, watched their retirement=
 savings sink after excelr announced on Oct. 16 that it would lose $618 mill=
ion in the fourth quarter. This came after excelr officers made more than $1=
36 million selling stocks earlier in the year.=20
Then on Nov. 8, excelr dropped the other shoe: It admitted it had overstated=
 earnings for four years by $586 million, or 20 percent. Over those few wee=
ks, excelr shares plunged from $33.84 to its $9 close on Friday.=20
The four-year overstatement developed through some novel accounting methods=
. excelr and its auditor, Arthur Anderson, insist that its financial reports=
 were all within proper standards, but the mechanics in this case included =
obscuring debt by placing it on the ledgers of other entities so that the p=
arent company's profit picture appeared rosier than it actually was.=20
The weeks from mid-October to early November were wrenching for employees. =
Because the company was changing its fund manager, they were powerless to m=
ake any changes in their 401(k) plans. PGE chief executive Peggy Fowler poi=
nts out that the change in 401(k) plan managers was announced last summer. =
And although employees could have gotten out of excelr stocks over the histo=
ry of the plan, excelr seemed to be an attractive investment.=20
Company executives, though, were selling. Jeffrey Skilling, who was promote=
d to excelr chief executive early in the year but resigned in August, sold m=
ore than $5 million in company shares according to transaction records cove=
ring the first half of the year.=20
Former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was fired last month in =
an action related to the financial mess, made $14 million in stock sales be=
tweeen March and November of last year. Kenneth Lay, excelr's chief executiv=
e, who returned after his protege Skilling left, made at least $20 million =
in stock sales from late last year. He has announced that he would decline =
his severance package.=20
Dynegy, another Texas energy marketing company, has made a bid to buy excelr=
. That probably means the best excelr and PGE employees can hope for now is =
that Dynegy will be a better corporate owner, or they can try their luck wi=
th one of the many shareholder lawsuits being filed.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating excelr's activities.=
 If its behavior was illegal, there will be consequences for company office=
rs.=20
That's still not much to offer to workers who have seen their retirement sa=
vings dissolve. But for now it's all there is.

FINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling.

FINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling - The legacy of the late 1990s stock=
 market bubble remains with us, as does irrationality THE LONG VIEW - BARRY=
 RILEY.=20
Optimism is back. Stock markets around the globe have typically rallied by =
20 per cent since rock bottom was reached on September 21. Only 9 per cent =
of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in 12 months, accord=
ing to a Merrill Lynch survey published this week.
But the legacy of the late 1990s stock market bubble remains with us. The c=
hallenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality. Two of the UK's big=
gest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday. Vodafone suffered #11.45=
bn of write-downs - but curiously, made no provisions against the sky-high =
#13.1bn it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences in 2000.=20
Such payments, argued Sir Christopher Gent, Voda-fone's chief executive, we=
re merely what the market demanded at the time. It is interesting to note, =
too, that Paul Klemperer, the Oxford professor who is an expert in ""auction=
 theory"" and advised the British government, has defended the disastrous ou=
tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital market's view of 3G'=
s prospects. The common theme here is that it is nobody's fault if crazy pr=
ices are paid, because they are legitimised by the stock market.=20
Marconi, which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g=
iant, has written off most of the #4.1bn paid for US internet hardware comp=
anies in 1999. There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US du=
ring the past few weeks over the near-collapse of excelr, the power group be=
ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy. There was an o=
bvious failure by investors - and by stock market analysts - to assess the =
true risks at excelr.=20
Smart businessmen will sellat mad prices, but why on earth should they buy?=
 The trouble is, too many academics have developed theories of value based =
on rational expectations. The real world is unfortunately very different.=
=20
Some of the distortions had obvious technical origins. The Vodafone bubble =
of 1999 reflected the cross-border takeover of Mannesmann and the artificia=
l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ball=
ooned in market capitalisation to reach, at one stage, 16 per cent of the F=
TSE 100 Index. The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen=
tals, but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting, =
at which point they were ""safe"" in terms of risk against the index benchmar=
k.=20
That was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low free-fl=
oat new issues: internet companies, especially, were floated off with only =
15 per cent of the stock made available, although anything up to 100 per ce=
nt went into the indices, creating serious shortages and bubble valuations.=
 Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p=
roblem, but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm=
ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks.=20
Takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality, and indeed this is an =
area where academics recognise the problem; over many years they have point=
ed out that all the benefits of deals, and often more than all, accrue to t=
he shareholders of the companies taken over, while investors in the bidding=
 companies suffer dilution. Investors know this, and in normal market condi=
tions news of a takeover will depress the bidder's share price. But in a bu=
bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria, as well=
 as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can =
maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities=
 of new equity.=20
Also, it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market =
is high than when it is low. Two years ago, companies such as Marconi were =
engaged in buying sprees at daft prices. Now, when prices are much lower, h=
ardly any acquisitions are being made (and investment banks are dismissing =
thousands of employees). An exception to the deal famine is gold mining, wh=
ich just happens to have been one of the stock market's strongest sectors t=
his year.=20
Another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock =
market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks. Over=
 recent years their earnings-per-share forecasts for the next calendar year=
 have been on average 8 per cent too high. This has not just been a mistake=
; they have been paid to be over-optimistic. Admittedly, attempts are being=
 made to restructure the incentives here, as the embarrassed investment ban=
ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors =
of judgment during the bull market, but it remains to be seen whether much =
will really change.=20
The mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts, and indeed=
 many professional investors do not. That Merrill survey, incidentally, sho=
ws that fund managers on average expect no more than 4 per cent earnings pe=
r share growth over the next year, while the stockbrokers' analysts are sti=
ll clinging to the hope that it will be 15 per cent.=20
A final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex=
ecutives the wrong sort of incentives. The ruin of Marconi may appear irrat=
ional, when multi-billion-pound acquisitions are being declared worthless a=
fter only two years. But executives with lucrative stock option plans, whic=
h pay off if their gambles go right, combined with golden goodbye and pensi=
on packages that are triggered if things go wrong, may well consider it per=
fectly rational, from their viewpoint, to take much bigger risks than other=
 shareholders, or employees, would consider acceptable.=20
Moreover, Sir Christopher Gent, shareholders of Vodafone will remember, rec=
eived a controversial #10m personal bonus last year for clinching the Manne=
smann takeover, a deal that requires #10bn of write-offs.=20
In normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati=
onal, but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window. Many i=
nvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly. That is why many =
people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of win=
ning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration.=20

excelr Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances
2001-11-17 11:06 (New York)

excelr Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances

     Houston, Nov. 17 (Bloomberg) -- excelr Corp. investors hope
the energy trader's third-quarter report to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission will answer some of the questions that
sent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival
Dynegy Inc.

     excelr, which has been criticized for failing to clearly
explain how it makes money, may disclose in Monday's filing more
on how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships, as
well as any planned job cuts and other cost-saving moves related
to Dynegy's $24 billion buyout.

     ``Investors will be looking for anything that affects the
likelihood of the (Dynegy) deal going through and the timing of
such a deal,'' said Edward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty
Utilities Fund, which owns 1.6 million in excelr shares.

     excelr agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 percent in
three weeks amid an SEC investigation into partnerships run by
excelr executives. Investors worry that new disclosures, such as
previously unreported debt, might threaten excelr's credit rating
and scuttle the merger, possibly pushing excelr into bankruptcy.

     ``There's been so much skepticism about what excelr's
liabilities are with these partnerships, I'm looking to quantify
this,'' said Glen Hilton, a fund manager at Montgomery Asset
Management LP, which holds Dynegy shares.

     excelr Chairman Kenneth Lay admitted last week that failed
investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to
Dynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open with
investors. Lay, 59, said last week he won't accept a severance
package of more than $60 million that he could have collected
following the takeover.

     excelr shares fell 48 cents yesterday to $9. Dynegy fell
$1.53, or 3.5 percent, to $42.47.

                           Balance Sheet

     excelr's third-quarter report, which had been expected last
week, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement of
earnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. excelr
reduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million to
include losses from affiliated partnerships.

     Monday's filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheet
summarizing assets and debts. excelr for years has omitted balance
sheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its press
releases announcing earnings.

     Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Lay
mentioned during a conference call last month that dealings with
two partnerships had reduced excelr's shareholder equity, or its
assets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led to
the ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

     ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what
(excelr's) ultimate liability will need to be,'' said Commerzbank
Securities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold'' and
doesn't own them.

     Monday's report probably won't give a complete answer, said
Louis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While the
balance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, which
were set up to buy excelr assets and get debt off the company's
books, it won't spell out excelr's share, he said.

     ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?''
Gagliardi said. ``We really don't know what that number is.''

                           Credit Rating

     Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if excelr's
legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``will
help us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong American
Utilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares.

     Both companies are based in Houston.

     The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``It
may say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencies
have told them,'' said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at
Williams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don't expect much.''

     excelr's stock drop led Moody's Investors Service to cut the
company's debt rating to the lowest investment grade. Dynegy held
off on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating would
be cut to junk, jeopardizing excelr's ability to raise cash needed
to settle its daily power and natural-gas trades.

     excelr may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much it
will pay to departing employees, Paik said. Chief Operating
Officer Greg Whalley said last week that fourth-quarter profit
will be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs. He
didn't give details.

     Jobs likely will be eliminated in businesses the company
plans to sell, including its money-losing telecommunications unit
and operations in Europe, analysts said.

     excelr has about 21,000 employees, two-thirds in the U.S. and
about a fifth in the U.K. Its 600 traders are divided between
London and Houston, where excelr employs about 7,500.

     Many excelr workers are already preparing for layoffs, said
Lyndon Taylor, a Houston-based recruiter for Heidrick & Struggles
International Inc., an executive placement firm.

     ``I got 56 resumes last week from excelr,'' Taylor said.
``That's equal to the number I got in the past year.''

WestLB Offers to Buy excelr's U.K. Water Unit, Newspaper Says
2001-11-17 20:01 (New York)


     London, Nov. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, Germany's largest state-owned bank, is one of
several suitors talking to excelr Corp. about its Wessex Water
unit, which is valued at more than 1 billion pounds ($1.4
billion), the Sunday Telegraph said without citing sources.

     Dynegy Inc. of the U.S. is looking to buy excelr for $24
billion, and will sell some of its assets, including Wessex.
WestLB made a formal offer to excelr in the past few days in hopes
of striking a quick deal because Dynegy may want to avoid the
regulatory risk in such a sale; any bid for a water company in the
U.K. worth at least 30 million pounds must be referred to the
Competition Commission, the newspaper said.

     excelr bought Wessex for 1.4 billion pounds in 1998. RWE AG of
Germany, Europe's fourth-biggest power company, is also interested
in Wessex, but excelr thinks U.K. regulators won't approve an RWE
bid because the company already owns Thames Water, a large U.K.
water company.

     WestLB has also been reported to be preparing a buyout for
Railtrack Group Plc, the insolvent owner of the U.K.'s train
tracks and stations, the paper said.


excelr Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon
2001-11-16 17:36 (New York)

excelr Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon

     Houston, Nov. 16 (Bloomberg) -- excelr Corp. closed Wednesday
on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon
Smith Barney Inc. that was secured with assets of its Transwestern
Pipeline Co., spokesman Vance Meyer said.

     excelr, the largest energy trader, said Nov. 1 that it had
received a commitment for $1 billion in loans from the investment
banks that would be used for debt payments and to supplement cash
reserves.

     excelr secured the loans with the assets of Transwestern and
the Northern Natural Gas Co. The two pipeline systems combined are
about 19,000 miles long and can deliver as much as 6 billion cubic
feet of gas a day. The remaining $450 million loan, secured with
the Northern Natural Gas assets, is in the documentation stage and
is expected to close next week, Meyer said.

     excelr agreed a week ago to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. in a
transaction now valued at $24.7 billion in stock and assumed debt.
The move followed a loss in investor confidence -- the company's
shares had fallen 90 percent this year -- and amid a federal
investigation of accounting irregularities that limited its
ability to finance operations.

     ChevronTexaco Corp., the second-biggest U.S. oil company and
Dynegy's largest shareholder with 26 percent, provided excelr,
through Dynegy, with a $1.5 billion cash infusion on Tuesday as
part of the buyout agreement.

     In return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights
in the excelr unit that owns Northern Natural Gas. If the merger
isn't completed, Dynegy will have the right to acquire Northern
Natural Gas, excelr said in regulatory filing Wednesday.
ChevronTexaco will provide Dynegy with another $1 billion after
the merger closes to maintain its equity stake.

     The shares of excelr fell 48 cents to $9, while shares of
Dynegy fell $1.53 to $42.47. Both companies are based in Houston.
Shares of San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco fell 35 cents to
$83.45.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as excelr employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-excelr holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for excelr to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Subject:	RE: Preliminary Cost Savings for EA

Our current plan on EA Operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10%.  I will get with you on Tuesday morning to review the names, but I feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys, as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders.  Our current estimate on cost reductions for EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago.  

Beth Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow.   We are in agreement, as Bob Hall has worked with Beth's team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM Enhancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other that escapes me at the moment).  Beth and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially-driven IT projects.  The headcount impact and dollar savings from these project eliminations are what Beth's team is focused on tonight.

Subject:	RE: Preliminary Cost Savings for EA

Pretty huge cuts,   I agree on cutting costs, its more about redefining and you may want to realign your business (as you said bring in some people from other areas).  This is probably all the detail I'll require.  Let me have your final numbers when you can.  Obviously if there are any senior position changes I think the gas and power guys would have a view as they do know who they like or not.

We do want to run the business as is, I think the big difference is new IT projects, we should still look at them but ones on a short time scale.  On Operations I think we just know that any growth planning we had envisaged is no longer required - we need to just get back to where we were.

Subject:	Preliminary Cost Savings for EA

From our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the business, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels), our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:

	Annualized Savings (in millions)  & Headcount Reductions (excelr Employees)

Direct Costs			Bonus		Subtotal 			Net 		Cap		Total 
Ops		IT		Accural		Savings		Severance	Savings		Ex		Savings

5.4		12.8		1.5		19.7		3.8		15.9		11.8		27.7	Dollar Savings


65		71		-		136									FTE Reduction



This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather positions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  

Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.

I  have been thinking of you and the first time we met at a conference in New York.  Much more innocent times. 

 To answer your question, I went to Euro Disney in october and I am scared of rollercoasters.  However, Teddy being 8 years old, I had to go on them.  I found Space Mountain (roller coaster in the dark) much easier to handle than a similar one where I actually could see the danger that I was putting myself in.
 
While it must be difficult for your people, they could do a lot worse than have you in charge.  Good luck with this situation.  I hope to speak to you soon.

To set the record straight, EES are maintaining their business as usual stance. This means that Anthony does NOT have to cut any people if he so wishes. He may, however, take this opportunity to sever low performers as part of the bigger severance plan if necessary.

Subject:	Revised Hdct. Spreadsheet

Have updated spreadsheet for known data tonight.  

THESE THINGS NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND POSSIBLY CHANGED: 


Had Perlman's total numbers from today, which she did no subdivide into EA, EIM and EGM numbers.  Made assumption that numbers from Sunday's spreadsheet for Beth's EGM and EIM totals stood, and backed into EA numbers by simply taking her total minus Sunday's EGM and EIM numbers.  You will want to gut check this with Beth. 

Had Jenny's current total headcount (546) and her reductions to contractors and FTE's.  Didn't have detail on her contractor versus FTE numbers after reductions.  Just assumed 100 contractors, remaining FTE's.  You will need to get that detail from Jenny to correctly reflect her Revised Headcount.  

There was a bust in numbers that I had for Commodity Logic Development.  Gros gave me the starting number of 46 (contractors and FTE's - but without current breakdown).  His reductions were 6 contractors and 8 FTE's, which should have left a revised total headcount of 32.  But I wrote down a revised total headcount of 24 for this group.  Off by 8, so I increased the number of contractor cuts to 14 to make the math work.  Please go over details with Tom and make corrections as needed.  

Didn't have confirmed starting total headcount for ISC.  Spreadsheet with his FTE names gives a count of 129, so I assumed that he has 50 contractors to come up to the spreadsheet starting number of 179.   Allan only reduced by 3 FTE's and if he plans to reduce contractors I did not have that info.  So all other numbers for the ISC are simply forced.  Please review with Allan and make corrections as needed.

I have been sort of waiting to talk to you about having a small event for my direct reports to thank them for their efforts until things cooled down at the company overall, but -- I don't see that happening any time soon.

We have not really done anything at all this year, and I wanted to do an event similar to the one you had last summer for us.  They have worked so hard and we can't ever all get away from the office at the same time  -- even to have a lunch.

Was thinking about having them over to my house for drinks and then out to eat at a restraunt.  For my direct reports and spouses.  Will include both Global Services and EES.  Was thinking of Friday night after work Dec 7th.  Need to get planning if I get the go ahead.

I have a reasonably priced italian restraunt in mind, and it would be about 20 people.   Are you ok with that? And if so, would you and David want to come too?

All,

Earlier today, an individual at excelr was contacted by someone claiming to be Jackie Buckhold (HR) from Dynegy.  The caller was requesting a copy of an organisational chart.  Evidence now seems to point in the direction that the caller was not Jackie Buckhold at all, but a recruitment consultant.

Please be aware that we should be exceptionally careful when providing information externally to maintain the confidentiality of excelr.  This is a common tactic of recruitment agencies, please emphasise to your staff that all external requests for internal information should be passed through yourselves or HR.

Hey,

I tried not to bother you today. Spent today working on the EBS Q4 & 2002 Action Plan and the Cash Flow Forecast and generally catching up. I spoke with DiMichele & Racicot and also and got a general update. I guess things look pretty bleak.

Just one point - being that I'm 5,000 miles from home (UK) with family & kids in school - I'd obviously appreciate as much notice as possible on any implications for myself - I know that may be tough, given the pace of change around here - but bear it in mind if you can.

I would be happy to sit down and discuss any plans you may (or may not have) for me. I'm a big boy - and I realise how serious this situation is.

Thanks.

Barry.

My goal here - for Jim - is to understand how many bodies (& related cost) it is going to take to support the Wholesale Post Bankruptcy actvities - as we are doing for all support and commercial functions - so we can complie a fwd cash forecast.

Any education would be appreciated. An org chart would also help.

I sent the summary below to Greg yesterday, but want to reconfirm with everyone today - particularly the contract numbers.  The highlighted columns represent those I don't feel are accurate at this point.   I will be meeting individually with everyone to review their spreadsheets one more time and begin discussing the process which now is to start Wednesday.  Below is the draft summary I have at this point - the contractor numbers are the ones in particular I need to get verified.

Understand your request, and you have my assurance that I will be very up-front with you.  No breaking news to share with you, however.  

Would love to get your input on the organization going forward, if you have time tomorrow.

Hey,

I tried not to bother you today. Spent today working on the EBS Q4 & 2002 Action Plan and the Cash Flow Forecast and generally catching up. I spoke with DiMichele & Racicot and also and got a general update. I guess things look pretty bleak.

Just one point - being that I'm 5,000 miles from home (UK) with family & kids in school - I'd obviously appreciate as much notice as possible on any implications for myself - I know that may be tough, given the pace of change around here - but bear it in mind if you can.

I would be happy to sit down and discuss any plans you may (or may not have) for me. I'm a big boy - and I realise how serious this situation is.

Thanks.

Barry.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the excelr Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to excelr employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

The Estate version of the systems were commissioned successfuly onto Estate hardware this weekend with the users completing their testing on sunday, and it looks as though we are in good shape for doing the same for NetCo this week.
 
Just a few weeks ago there was a lot of doubts that it could be done, but thanks to a great display of team work, and just plain hard work, with many late nights (and a few sleep overs....), we met our first major milestone!!!!!
 
Thanks for the outstanding efforts over the last two weeks, that made this weekend possible.

Subject: Debt Trading Losses

Bryan,
I think the second bullet is misleading.  The bullet is not reflective of 
what is actually stated in the attached document.
There is a month-end price verification process on the Credit book.  
Trader pricing is compared to prime broker pricing.  Where the mark is 
greater that 2 points, the difference is discussed with the trader.  Trader 
must then amend the mark or provide third party substantiation for the 
illiquid position.
The Price Verifiaction Comparison Spreadsheet with broker quotes is filed and 
maintained by Risk Management.

The Operations break-down in the process relates to:
 Triplets excluded from the monthly price verification process and not 
escalated, prioritized to management
 Telewest  pricing relied on a price from the prime broker which was manually 
sourced and not current
 Price Verification Comparison results should be formalized and distributed 
to senior management.

Thanks. Sheila

Subject: Debt Trading Losses


We have discovered two positions in the Debt Trading book which were not 
being marked to market. The current mark of the 2 positions results in 
approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :



The primary control issues are:
? Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had 
not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)

The losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by 
Operations.  The trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will 
implement the steps agreed with Operations to ensure that we have a robust 
approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.

to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

The first annual Global Conference will be held at the Rice Hotel in downtown 
Houston on June 15th and June 16th.  The theme of the conference is 
'Foundations of ""One excelr"".'  A review of Global Data 
Management's(Counterparty, Contracts, Facilities, Rates, Entelligence) role 
in the development and support of central information regarding excelr's 
customers and relationships and plans for expanding that role will be 
discussed.  Many topics will re-inforce worldwide initiatives, communication 
between business units, and learning to leverage knowledge and expertise from 
multiple sources. There will also be a special workshop session on 
multi-cultural awareness to prepare our teams for working in a global 
environment.  

And then you say.....
""Mary and I would like to feature you as a distinguished speaker, so you may 
relate to Mary's team and conference attendees why consistent global 
information is so important to excelr.  What value does constancy of

Mark,

It's good to hear from you. Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I 
didn't realize you were not aware of the situation. 

Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap 
a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up 
through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in 
London on May 8th.

Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat 
an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he 
had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more 
week, to May 15th.

Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 11, but apparently his 
plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend 
since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now 
wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.

Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S. 
the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize 
my plans around his leaving on May 11, and he relocate to a hotel if he 
needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out 
with him instead of returning early.

Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out  date to him, I guess we work 
around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 22 
as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may 
continue to drag on day-by-day.

Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and 
Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how 
strict ""two full working days"" is, we may actually need for him to be out no 
later than Wednesday, May 17--or even Wednesday, May 10.)

The May 18th date is locked in stone.  We have already reserved seats on a 
Continental flight @ Noon Thursday, May 18.  It's unfortunate that Mark was 
not kept up to date, but we have only moved back the date 1 time due to the 
May Day riots.  Tom and I have been in constant contact and we have confirmed 
the move-out date.  The book-split project will be implemented tomorrow and I 
will spend the next few days ensuring that the traders understand how to book 
their deals and that Risk is able to generate and explain the DPR on a timely 
basis.  Also, while I am here I plan to meet with the Weather Derivatives 
team to assess their needs and gain an understanding of their markets.

This project will not drag on day-by-day as mentioned below.  There is much 
more that can be done, but that is out of the scope of this project; besides 
I am ready to come home.

Have a good weekend,

issues/questions have been raised that if explored, could result in a better 
solution for the money.  

Option 1
The update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to 
monthly for a cost of $87,000 (USD) through March, 2001.

Option 2
I wasn't sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in.  If 
you are particularly interested in the Financial Stress Score and Credit 
Score, for example, there are multiple alternatives :
 
 2a) Keep quartlery refresh of base data (party name, etc) and refresh scores 
that are added/changed on a monthly basis.  Cost - $1.17(USD) per 
record.          Note that there are 575,000 records in the file currently 
with financial and credit scores, making this potentially a very expensive 
alternative 
        (575,000 X 1.17=$ 672,750).

 2b) Batch or FTP updates of the financial and stress scores can only be 
provided monthly.  D&B is working on a solution that would provide a 
weekly         update to their customers in a batch or FTP manner, but has 
not committed to when this will be ready.  Therefore, if more timely updates 
than monthly                          are desired, it is also possible to 
transactionally access records one at a time using D&B's software.  The cost 
for this is extremely high at $10.52         (USD) per score. 

Option 3
D&B Connect Product.
 D&B Connect is a tool set of matching software, an externally validated 
reference file, credit and marketing information, and D&B services that 
enables the  most effective integration of customer information and 
third-party information with D&B information.  Only this type of process and 
information integration  capability can facilitate and ensure accurate 
identification, linkage and maintenance of your customer's complete 
relationship.   In addition, D&B Connect  assures organizations of 
referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to D&B so 
that the most recent D&B information is always  transmitted to your 
organization and updated within your local D&B Connect Reference File.  D&B 
Connect is scalable.  

 Cost Typically ranging from
 * Customer Access Module (CAM) Batch- - $25,000
 * CAM Online - $50,000
 * Full Information Integrator - $350,000 + data

With more specifics as to your needs, this option should perhaps be pursued.


Questions/Issues

1) D&B had questions regarding the use of their data and whether excelr 
customers would be offered this information for a fee or free.  I explained 
that I  did not feel the data would be offered directly to excelr customers, 
but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available 
externally via web  site, etc.  All pricing above is based upon this 
understanding.  If I have not portrayed the usage correctly, it will be 
imperative to get a better understanding  before final pricing can be 
negotiated.

2)  Are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?  
Alternatives may vary by data element.  Financial Stress Score and Credit 
Score reference  above were explored as an example.

3)  What is timeframe for needing a solution ?

4)  Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on U.S. 
companies.  A comparable measure - Global Failure Score (the liklihood of 
default or  bankruptcy)  is available for international companies.  This 
rating score however, is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner.  
This could result  in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this 
score in a batch manner.

5)  Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit 
analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes.  This is 
probably  negotiable as the data is the same.  The thought process is that if 
the repository is used for credit or risk decisions, D&B will see decreased 
usage and  revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments.

28725,beck-s/discussion_threads/1006.,<15623145.1075855831836.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Thank you for keeping us in the loop on this.  D&B data will become one of 
our most important sources.  As you suggest, the intent is to use this data 
along with other available date to generate a price for credit.  The price 
will be published externally (likely for a fee and as a free service) via the 
web or via automated processes.  

Option 3 appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to 
date data as possible.  Stuart is working with the credit team to define 
additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely 
what we are looking for.  Alternatively, if it is possible to obtain the 
actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to 
generate our own score in addition to D&B's.  We will need the Global Failure 
Score as well.  Currently we are active in Europe as well as the US and 
expect to move towards Asia and Austrailia over time.  Hopefully, this data 
is available via D&B Connect.

Another consideration is the term of contract.  We would likely prefer a 
longer term contract so that if they decide they don't like what we are doing 
with the data, we cannot be cut off.  Does it make sense from your 
perspective to approach D&B to be our long term, strategic providor of 
customer data.  This would likely make their deal maker look good in his 
boss's eyes, give you lot's of negotiating ability and give a us the long 
term preferential contract that we are looking for.

Let's discuss further.

referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to D&B so 
that the most recent D&B information is always  transmitted to your 
organization and updated within your local D&B Connect Reference File.  D&B 
Connect is scalable.  

 Cost Typically ranging from
 * Customer Access Module (CAM) Batch- - $25,000
 * CAM Online - $50,000
 * Full Information Integrator - $350,000 + data

With more specifics as to your needs, this option should perhaps be pursued.


Questions/Issues

1) D&B had questions regarding the use of their data and whether excelr 
customers would be offered this information for a fee or free.  I explained 
that I  did not feel the data would be offered directly to excelr customers, 
but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available 
externally via web  site, etc.  All pricing above is based upon this 
understanding.  If I have not portrayed the usage correctly, it will be 
imperative to get a better understanding  before final pricing can be 
negotiated.

2)  Are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?  
Alternatives may vary by data element.  Financial Stress Score and Credit 
Score reference  above were explored as an example.

3)  What is timeframe for needing a solution ?

4)  Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on U.S. 
companies.  A comparable measure - Global Failure Score (the liklihood of 
default or  bankruptcy)  is available for international companies.  This 
rating score however, is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner.  
This could result  in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this 
score in a batch manner.

5)  Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit 
analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes.  This is 
probably  negotiable as the data is the same.  The thought process is that if 
the repository is used for credit or risk decisions, D&B will see decreased 
usage and  revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments.

uncovered the importance of Risk's involvement in watching this - especially 
during the morning hours.  The Sitara bridge failed at 10:35a.m.  and we came 
very close to missing our nom deadlines on several next day deals.  We 
(Product Control) do have a safeguard in place (our IT department is beeped 
if a deal stays in intermediate status for over 5 minutes), but we did not 
receive timely notification of this issue - it was at least 15 minutes after 
the problem started.  We have fixed that going forward - Jennifer Denny and 
Torrey Moorer will be beeped in addition to IT.  

We will continue to make every effort to watch the bridge; however, the Risk 
groups (or some designated individual(s)) must be watching this as well to 
ensure that any deals that fail are entered into the downstream systems on a 
timely basis, and primarily to alert us of any problems ASAP.  If anyone in

arrive too late. Here they are anyway:


1 Socrates

I think it inappropriate for me, or anyone in RAC for that matter, to have 
primary responsibility for this system/project.

But if I were responsible the first thing I would want to know is why this 
project, which commenced in May 1998, as I recall, is still incomplete, given 
that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in 
history, concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart.


2 Exhaustive ?

It doesn't look like an exhaustive list and I suspect it was not intended to 
be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such. 


3 Symptoms or Causes ?

Many of the points look like the former, and addressed as they stand will 
likely leave us with a Band-aid solution which will drop off when pressure is 
applied. 
In fact many of them look like they are a result of Point 5 : 

 ""Prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control 
functionality...""

because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten, confirmation 
errors get made, deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright 
people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think 
about changing the way they work. And, for example, when those people move 
on, as they surely will, the institution has no memory of how to do what they 
did. 

I am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on 
Microsoft Excel all day, everyday. 


4 Overall

I think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way. Rather 
than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking 
off, we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate.

As a hypothesis, if most issues stem from Point 5, then I would ask why has 
prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control 
functionality ?

I am a friend Mark and Lynn Richards through a family connection in the

of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing 
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success 
at achieving those standards.  I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on 
meeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in 
an extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their 
gas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review 
to start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement 
methodology for the London office.

In order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards 
across excelr, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment 
for the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and 
other commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and 
Wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.

I have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so 
that we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those 
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not 
operating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to 
develop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:
 - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash 
collections are timely)
 - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its 
maximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date 
with            exceptions noted)
 - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard 
(i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)
 - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each 
measurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)

I would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control 
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of 
work has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time 
requirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to 
be completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a 
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but 
it is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.

As discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for 
each functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk

power operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know

Thank you for taking the time to see me when I was in Houston, and for lunch. 

I am working on a detailed comprehensive plan of action to enact the changes 
we discussed re the settlement and confirmations procedures transfer. Due to 
the volume of work that was on my desk upon my return this is not coming 
together quite as quickly as I would like and therefore we are going to have 
to look at it piece by piece. 

We need to issue a new authorised signatory list this week for excelr 
Australia Energy and excelr Australia Finance Pty Ltd due to changes in the 
dealer structure and therefore we have decided that this would be a good 
opportunity to make the change to the approval of confirmations. 

As agreed, we will have Sydney office take over responsibility for signing 
all confirmations. This means they are still prepared in Sydney, as they are 
now, with the change of procedure being that they will now be signed in 
Sydney and faxed from here to our clients. The primary signatories will be 
the Managing Director (Paul Quilkey) or the Chief Financial Officer (Heidi 
Mason). In the event of both being unavailable they will be signed by the 
Senior Legal Counsel (David Minns). 

The confirmation log will be maintained in its entirety by Sydney Office and 
will be held in a directory accessible by Houston. This will allow 
independent audit review to occur as required. 

In order to implement this change we have prepared a new authorised 
signatories list which we are planning to distribute at the end of this week. 
In the meantime could you please advise of what action needs to be taken in 
Houston to ensure all the relevant areas are advised. Clearly a  key 
individual will be Sue Frusco. When I met with Sue in Houston we discussed 
briefly the fact that you and I had agreed that invoicing and confirmations 
would move to Sydney but at that stage there was no timing raised. Sue seemed 
happy to stay with the current arrangements until such time as we implemented 
a change. Do you want me to advise Sue or will someone from Houston speak to 
her?

Thanks

incompleteness of the list of issues. As I outlined, the key point has been 
identified, but its knock - on effects are widespread and worrying, 
especially as they concern the Continental Power operation:

As of today the most recent finalised DPR for this business was for 11th May, 
and during the period between then and now we have seen (although in milder 
form) a repeat of the turmoil on the Amsterdam Power Exchange (APX) that we 
witnessed in January this year. This is not the time or the market to not 
know our position.

The business is soon to apply for higher limits to accommodate a new 
transaction on the Polish border. I am bound to comment that based on the 
state it appears to be in, I would not recommend higher limits.

To add insult to injury, as a result of the way this area has been allowed to 
develop, much of the know-how is in the heads (and spreadsheets) of certain 
key individuals who it seems are now bound rapidly for EBS. 

UK Gas seems to have slipped too. Yesterday they reported a $7m loss due to 
the value of a set of options which were part of a structured deal, booked 
""off-system"" and not revalued for over a month. Worryingly, there seemed to 
be more time spent arguing over the nuances of a Loss Notification memo, than 
answering some fundamental questions about why it happened.

As a corollary, our process of performing ""risk reviews"" has become all the 
more important in identifying holes in our capture and treatment of market 
risk in the firm. I expect these to play a big part in our effort to 
stabilise these areas.

Subject: Re: Project Doorstep Responsibility Matrix  


Thanks for the summary. I was out last week so apologies if my comments 
arrive too late. Here they are anyway:


1 Socrates

I think it inappropriate for me, or anyone in RAC for that matter, to have 
primary responsibility for this system/project.

But if I were responsible the first thing I would want to know is why this 
project, which commenced in May 1998, as I recall, is still incomplete, given 
that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in 
history, concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart.


2 Exhaustive ?

It doesn't look like an exhaustive list and I suspect it was not intended to 
be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such. 


3 Symptoms or Causes ?

Many of the points look like the former, and addressed as they stand will 
likely leave us with a Band-aid solution which will drop off when pressure is 
applied. 
In fact many of them look like they are a result of Point 5 : 

 ""Prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control 
functionality...""

because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten, confirmation 
errors get made, deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright 
people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think 
about changing the way they work. And, for example, when those people move 
on, as they surely will, the institution has no memory of how to do what they 
did. 

I am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on 
Microsoft Excel all day, everyday. 


4 Overall

I think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way. Rather 
than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking 
off, we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate.

As a hypothesis, if most issues stem from Point 5, then I would ask why has 
prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control 
functionality ?

I am forwarding information about derivatives I & II to you for your 
consideration.   The Paradigm Group would conduct the training in house 
around the middle of the month for your group's convenience.   We have had 
prior experience with their progam and recommend them.    I don't know if the 
cost is within your budget but, I understand the importance of uniformly 
training your group in derivatives.
Let me know your thoughts,

Subject: D1 and D2

As per your client's request, here is the information I was able to come up 
with concerning derivatives training:

While I recognise the need for a time-efficient approach to derivatives 
training, the benefit of this class will be diminished with any compression 
or omission of subject matter.  It is recommended that the two-day format 
remain the same.

All ""Ernie"" derivatives classes are full for the next three months; however, 
the vendor can provide a ""by invitation only"" D1 class in mid January.  As 
many as 50+/- employees can attend this class during the week of January 
16th.  The proposed schedule is as follows:

1/16/00   1/17/00   1/18/00   1/19/00
D1 (day one)  D1 (day two)  D1 (day one)  D1 (day two)
first 25 people  first 25 people  second 25  second 25
$6000   $6000   $6000   $6000

The vendor is quite booked for the 1st quarter.  They are not able to offer 
D2 until mid March or April if the Mid month schedule is to be followed.  One 
D2 class could be offered on 2/1/00 and 2/2/00 should this be an acceptable 
option.  Another D2 class may be available on 2/8/00 and 2/9/00, but this has 
not been confirmed by the vendor as of yet.  

The daily rate is $6000 for 25 students.  Classes are not recommended to 
exceed 25 people.  We need to get back to the vendor quickly to secure these 
dates if we'd like to do this.  

If you need additional information, please let me know.

THANK YOU .... to those of you who attended the summer analyst info session.  
For those of you who couldn't attend,  the information will be delivered to 
you via inter-office mail.  

As we discussed yesterday, our goal is to ensure a quality summer for all of 
our interns.  To continue in those efforts we encourage you to schedule a 
meeting with your intern during his/her first week to:
 explain group/department initiatives
establish roles/responsibilities and define performance expectations

ALSO, PLEASE NOTE:  interns starting on Monday, May 22 will be available to 
report directly to their supervisors following lunch.  Due to availability 
and limited space, PC training will take place later in the week.  Interns 
that start on June 5 will report to their supervisors that afternoon 
following PC training. 

Thank you again for your time and your support.  Please contact me if you 
have any questions.

I decided that this would be the quickest way to get in touch this afternoon,
as I know you must be very busy after taking yesterday off to be with us, and
also I know you will have many things you would like to do at home tonight.
There is no way to say thanks for the great two days.  You are always so
gracious and generous in every way, time, thought, etc.

I really enjoyed going with you to your office and now I can picture you each
day.  I found it very pleasent to sit at your desk.  Please tell Patti that I
enjoyed meeting her.

Thanks so much for taking me to see the interesting shop, and I will look
forward to going there again and using my generous Mother's Day gift
certificate!!  I am still thinking about the table I saw there-it is not a
lot larger than the table I have, but I like the fact that it is a cabinet.

It was very interesting to see your house and what has been done and what you
plan to do with your furnishings.  I think it will be wonderful and I look
forward to seeimg it all finished.  Keep me posted on what is going on and
what decisions you make.  I really do think you and your family will enjoy
the spacious large room.

I do hope David will have good news about his problem and hope that it can be
easily treated.

I thoroughly enjoyed the recital, and I think Amanda played beautifully.
Please tell her that I am so proud of her with the way she is doing in her
music, with the wonderful gold medal, and also doing so great in her school
work.  I hope she has a great two weeks at camp, and I am sure that you will
send me her camp address.  When you have time we can plan her visit time.

It was fun seeing Meagan, and she was very thoughtful to bring Michael by to
see us.  I mentioned to her that if she just wanted a change of scenery after
she goes to camp we would love for her to come over and visit.

Tyler was so much fun too, and especially now that he really knows who we are
and is comfortable with us.  We better stay strong and well so he can have
some visits with us!

I know I probably have forgotten something, but  the visit with you was
great.  Thanks you for being such a loving, thoughtful, and generous
daughter.  I am very proud of you.

Much love,

Subject: Action plan

Sally

Thank you for taking the time to see me when I was in Houston, and for lunch. 

I am working on a detailed comprehensive plan of action to enact the changes 
we discussed re the settlement and confirmations procedures transfer. Due to 
the volume of work that was on my desk upon my return this is not coming 
together quite as quickly as I would like and therefore we are going to have 
to look at it piece by piece. 

We need to issue a new authorised signatory list this week for excelr 
Australia Energy and excelr Australia Finance Pty Ltd due to changes in the 
dealer structure and therefore we have decided that this would be a good 
opportunity to make the change to the approval of confirmations. 

As agreed, we will have Sydney office take over responsibility for signing 
all confirmations. This means they are still prepared in Sydney, as they are 
now, with the change of procedure being that they will now be signed in 
Sydney and faxed from here to our clients. The primary signatories will be 
the Managing Director (Paul Quilkey) or the Chief Financial Officer (Heidi 
Mason). In the event of both being unavailable they will be signed by the 
Senior Legal Counsel (David Minns). 

The confirmation log will be maintained in its entirety by Sydney Office and 
will be held in a directory accessible by Houston. This will allow 
independent audit review to occur as required. 

In order to implement this change we have prepared a new authorised 
signatories list which we are planning to distribute at the end of this week. 
In the meantime could you please advise of what action needs to be taken in 
Houston to ensure all the relevant areas are advised. Clearly a  key 
individual will be Sue Frusco. When I met with Sue in Houston we discussed 
briefly the fact that you and I had agreed that invoicing and confirmations 
would move to Sydney but at that stage there was no timing raised. Sue seemed 
happy to stay with the current arrangements until such time as we implemented 
a change. Do you want me to advise Sue or will someone from Houston speak to 
her?

Thanks

Heidi

have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to excelr.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to excelr.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at excelr.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the 
audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).

Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best 
senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have 
ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of 
work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked 
for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent 
evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of 
the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working 
on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office 
processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of 
PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to 
manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 
this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will 
be approved. Since I've only been with excelr a short time and would like to 
continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith 
to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His 
number is 713 356 5617.

Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting 
and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving 
Koch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a 
good guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be 
reachable through the general number for Koch.

Admin assistants

Connie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative 
assistant.  She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for 
PwC's audit and internal audit service lines.  She is very interested in 
excelr and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.  I have not 
worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked 
to her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC 
number).

Ellen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave 
PwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on 
how she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).",Non Abusive

the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the 
audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).

Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best 
senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have 
ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of 
work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked 
for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent 
evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of 
the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working 
on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office 
processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of 
PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to 
manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 
this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will 
be approved. Since I've only been with excelr a short time and would like to 
continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith 
to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His 
number is 713 356 5617.

Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting 
and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving 
Koch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a 
good guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be 
reachable through the general number for Koch.

Admin assistants

Connie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative 
assistant.  She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for 
PwC's audit and internal audit service lines.  She is very interested in 
excelr and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.  I have not 
worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked 
to her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC 
number).

Ellen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave 
PwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on 
how she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).

Subject: Re: excelr Trading  

I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working 
with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help 
insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place 
in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as 
an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying 
the coal.  Therefore, the net excelr position will probably be carried in the 
London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to 
determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These 
books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd 
party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local 
curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and 
energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading 
activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process 
(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management 
administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting 
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general 
ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The 
following questions need to be addressed:  

  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be 
required?
      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for 
determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the 
      policy, if necessary.   
  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?
      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure 
required for the India office.    

Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and 
arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen 
complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your 
hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we 
demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain 
sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. 

Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date. 


Thanks,
Wanda Curry

Wanda,

It was nice talking to you on the conference call. Have you had a chance to 
review my presentation?. Your comments would be extremely helpful to me. When 
we setup the Risk/Credit/Accnt/MIS/Internal Control function, I want to make 
sure we do it RIGHT the FIRST time, keeping in mind that there is always room 
for improvement later.

In addition, I would like to discuss with you certain thought I have on the 
accounting, budgeting,internal controls and internal audit areas in EIPL. Do 
you plan to travel to India in the near future. Please let me know.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL/SOLICITOR-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

This E:mail is to confirm the all employee staff meeting this morning. 

As discussed, various representatives of Industry Canada will be in our 
offices over the next number of days to investigate certain matters under the 
authority of an Order granted in the Federal Court of Canada.  

Industry Canada is pursuing an application with respect to certain 
allegations involving excelr Canada Corp. and which we obviously believe to be 
unsubstantiated, as will be ultimately proven in the normal course of 
proceedings.  

This memo is to confirm the following:

1. Each of the individuals from Industry Canada may enter into conversations 
with you, ask you questions about our business or your business, ask you to 
provide information, documentation, etc.  In this regard, excelr Canada 
Corp.'s interests are represented by the law firm of Blake, Cassels & 
Graydon.  Each member of Industry Canada has assigned to it a representative 
of the firm of Blake, Cassels & Graydon, under the supervision of Dalton 
McGrath, who is a partner with his firm.  You are not speak to or provide any 
such information to any of the representatives of Industry Canada except 
under the authority and direction of a representative of Blake, Cassels & 
Graydon.  In other words, you are to advise the representatives of Industry 
Canada that you need to seek the advice and instructions of counsel before 
speaking with them or providing any information.

2. Although it is business as usual, as is the case whenever we have any 
outside visitors in the office, it is important to maintain the 
confidentiality of your business and your information.  In other words, the 
representatives of Industry Canada are here for a specified purpose and they 
should be treated no differently than any other third parties when you are 
discussing, negotiating or documenting transactions that do not concern them.

3. It is excelr Canada Corp.'s intention to be cooperative and 
non-obstructive.  At the same time, it is both appropriate and customary that 
we do not assist the representatives of Industry Canada in doing their jobs.  
In other words, they know what they are looking for, and it is appropriate 
and customary for us not to point them in any particular direction, which may 
be the right or wrong direction.  Again, documentation and information 
requests are to be handled directly through Blake, Cassels & Graydon under 
the supervision of Dalton McGrath.

4. If the representatives of Industry Canada take any information (whether in 
physical, electronic or other form) it is imperative that through a 
representative of Blake, Cassels & Graydon that information is inventoried, 
and please ensure that this is the case.  All such information will be 
subject to a legal privilege and therefore it is important to specifically 
identify any information requested or acquired.

5. Although this matter may come out in the public domain, either 
intentionally or unintentionally, it is imperative that this matter not 
become in the public domain through any act or omission of an excelr Canada 
Corp. employee.  It is a duty of your employment, consistent with any other 
matter affecting your employment, that this matter be kept strictly 
confidential and within the confines of excelr Canada Corp. (i.e. not to be 
discussed with your counterparts in Houston) on a need to know basis.  This 
includes, particularly with representatives of Industry Canada in the office, 
that this matter is not the subject of gossip or ""coffee talk"".  

6. If you receive a request to discuss this matter through the media or other 
such outlet, you are not to respond to that request, and all matters should 
be referred to Rob Milnthorp, who will deal with them appropriately.  If the 
requests come from customers, competitors, acquaintances, family, 
counterparts in Houston, and the like, you are simply to advise that you are 
unable to discuss the matter.

7. All matters are to be handled through the following people:

Rob Milnthorp, for all commercial matters;
Peter Keohane, for all legal matters; and
Dalton McGrath or one of his designated representatives of Blake, Cassels & 
Graydon.

I want to emphasize that excelr Canada Corp. is doing all of the appropriate 
things to ensure that our rights and interests are protected, while being as 
cooperative as possible.  I want to emphasize the excelr Canada Corp. believes 
any claim made by or through Industry Canada is without merit, and the steps 
we have taken should only be viewed as prudent and not as any indication of 
any liability by excelr Canada Corp.

Regards, Peter

Senior level risk people

Andy Dunn
until 3 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management practice.  Due 
to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client related), he left 
the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit and the non-audit 
personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  I have worked 
with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend him to excelr.  
The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to travelling a lot, 
but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not interested in 
leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith
Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in Houston.  We worked 
very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for Coral Energy and Equiva 
trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 15 years where he had 
many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, products trader, he worked 
in the risk management department, in the refinery itself as an engineer).  
Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are extremely impressed with his 
knowledge and background.  I would highly recommend him for a leadership role 
at excelr.  I spoke to him and he is interested in pursuing opportunities at 
excelr.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  His cell phone number is 713 412 
3890.



IT/Risk people


Shawn lafferty, Alan Beaton, & Carolyn Johnson
These people are all senior managers in KPMG's Information risk management 
department and are all looking for opportunities outside KPMG.  They all have 
8+ years work experience in the IT field.  KPMG's main number is 713 319 2000.


Mid level risk people


Marilyn Chee 
She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of accounting for 
derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and all mtm 
accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was their auditor.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Scott Barnes
Scott is an audit manager at PwC.  He has worked in energy for his career, 
which he spent in Houston and Moscow and New York.  He has worked as an audit 
manager, a special projects manager for the managing partner of the Houston 
office, a manager in the capital markets group (the group responsible for 
helping non-US companies prepare to register and list with the SEC), and the 
transaction support group (the group that is resposnible for performing due 
diligence procedures for PwC clients).  He is looking for opportunities 
outside PwC.  The PwC general line is 713 356 4000.

Keith Considine
He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best senior PwC 
Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have ever worked 
with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of work experience 
(all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked for me on the 
Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent evaluation from both 
myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of the best people any 
of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working on a project at one 
of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office processes .  He definitely 
does not see himself as a long time employee of PwC, but is currently 
planning on staying there until he is promoted to manager.  I actually 
recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 this year, but due to 
capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will be approved. His 
number is 713 356 5617.


Junior level risk people

Robin Manspeaker 
currently works as a scheduler at Equiva Trading.  She has been there about a 
year and a half.  Before that, she worked at Novarco in White Plains (a 
subsidiary of Marc Rich).  She was there about 3 years.  I do not know where 
she was before that.  I have worked with her during my audits of Marc Rich.  
She seemed very well versed in her knowledge of her job and processes 
surrounding it. I do not have her number, but you can call Shell information 
at 713 241 6161 and they will transfer you.

Dave Simpson
Analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting and has work 
experience of about 2 years.  He is very interested in leaving Koch.  I know 
him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a good guy and 
very likeable.  His phone number is 713 544 7649

Robert Hernandez
is someone who may be able to fill an open position at excelr South America.  
Last year, Robert worked for me at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on the 
external audit of Coral Energy.  He was a great worker and very good at his 
job.  He speaks fluent Spanish as well as fluent English.

Before working at PwC, Robert worked in the gas trading industry in the 
mid/back office.  I'm not sure of all of his responsibilities, but I do know 
he was involved in gas actualizations. In total, I think he has about 4 years 
of work experience.

He left PwC in March to take a position with Heins in their internal audit 
department.  I have not spoken to him since he left, but do know he paid a 
recruiter to find him this position.  I do not know if he is happy at his 
current company or not.

I do not know his number, but he can surely be found by using the general 
line.  I looked it up for you and came up with two - 713 785 1494, 713 225 
0565.


Admin assistants


Connie Shugart
she is currently working at PwC as an administrative assistant.  She is also 
involved in recruiting experienced personnel for PwC's audit and internal 
audit service lines.  She is very interested in excelr and has asked me a few 
times to get her a contact here.  I have not worked directly with her but due 
to her close proximity to my office I talked to her a number of times and was 
very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC number).  I have spoken to her 
about giving her name to Tony and she is very excited about coming over and 
interviewing.  She really wants to work for excelr!

Ellen Robertson
She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave PwC.   I have 
never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on how she 
should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).",Non Abusive

Hope all is going well.  The following is a list of things I'm working on.  

I'm midway through putting together the ""straw-man"" for the doorstep review - 
which will consist of a proposal on what our goals are, what should be done 
to meet those goals, who should do it, and when it should be done.  I hope to 
have it ready for your review during the week of the 12th.  I'm working 
together with Rick Carson on it, and also obtaining input from all the people 
who participated in previous doorstep reviews.
I'm working with Mike to determine what gaps we have in the DPR process 
(certain info may not be complete, some books are not received on a timely 
basis).  We have some thoughts, I just need to write them up and do a bit of 
research to determine how to deal with these issues.
I have a meeting set up with Jan-Erland for next Friday to discuss Japan.  
I've been attending the conference calls, but need to establish my role in 
the process.  I also received a message from Joe Hirl, and will set up a 
meeting with him while I'm in Japan.
I've made initial contact with India, and will start attending their 
conference calls.  Milind Laad has asked me to fly down to see the office, 
but before I do that, I need to get up to speed with what they have done 
already.
I've met with Eugenio and we have discussed the projects he works on.  He and 
I need to structure what his future projects are and the resources needed for 
those projects.
I'll be in London next week (I leave this Sunday and will be back in the 
office on Friday) working with Brent.  I expect he will be able to give me a 
lot of information to help with the doorstep straw-man.

Patti is trying to set up a weekly or bi-weekly discussion for us, starting 
the week of the 12th. Until that time, I'll keep you updated through e-mail 
and voice mail.  If you need me, I have given Patti all my contact info for

Subject: MG Doorstep reviews

Doug

The Doorstep team will wish to visit any MG trading locations in order to do 
deal testing.  In order to weed out the origination offices from trading 
offices we have agreed the following approach with Brent.  You were 
unanimously voted as the man to co-ordinate the effort.

1.  As there are various suitable (i.e. ex-auditors/risk controls) excelr 
people visiting certain offices, they will use the standard questionnaire 
(Brent should send this to you) in order to establish if the activity is of a 
trading nature.  These people (so far identified) are myself (Liverpool on 
Tuesday), Andy (Germany & US offices from 19th June), Lloyd Fleming (same as 
Andy) & Tani Nath (Korea & Singapore next week I believe).

2.  AA are internal auditor of MG.  I have arranged with Sarah Williams to 
get the MG internal audit manager to organise a meeting with you in order for 
you to review the audit plans and understand what they have reviewed, whether 
their internal audit includes deal testing, how they have already reviewed 
(or not) the remote offices.....  You should plan to report back to Andy, 
Brent & I on Friday (please could you organise the meeting).  I have the 
audit report for MGL & MGMCC audit is due to start on tuesday.

3.  Once we have clarified the extent of AAs work we will assess what else 
needs to happen and who to get in to the various different offices to 
complete the reviews.

Many thanks

By way of background, he was previously working with Eastern in the UK in a

since relocating to Houston in the online area. His references are very good.

have a strong background in trading operations?  Will he be  able to 
coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able 
to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump 
start on how best to assimilate the business?   I think that this effort 
should be much broader than deal testing.  It should encompass assessing 
people, processes, controls, systems support, etc.  To do this quickly and 
effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading 
operations.   I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be 
the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in

with an appropriate team from ENA to review the Chicago and New York

those, but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to 
commitments to attend a funeral.  I talked with Ted Bland this morning and he 
suggested that I provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in 
Energy Operations.  

Analysts

Tara Piazze - potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams

Joseph Piotrowski - AA consulting background; would be a good fit for my 
operations team focused on EOL (these are ENA employees) -- I need to add 
more  strength to this group

Charles Ames - currently works in back office for a brokerage firm; wants  to 
trade; would like to have him in risk to learn the business and excelr's risk 
books;  we  could immediately benefit from his background, while he learns 
excelr and how we manage risk; then he could add even more value in moving to 
a trading  role, if appropriate


Better Fits as Direct Hires (not analyst or associate, based on work 
experience and fit)

Mike Perun - VP of small bank; Ted brought him in with my group in mind; two 
of my directors interviewed him on Saturday; we'd like to consider him as a 
direct hire

Jason Sukenik- Undergrad and masters degrees in accounting, plus MBA; could 
be good fit as direct hire in as manager/director based on experience


Associates

Ryan Ngo - I believe that Kevin Presto suggested him for my group

Adele Pickens - She's on my list; need to research interviewers comments who 
suggested my group for an assignment for her (I don't think that anyone from  
Energy Operations interviewed him or her) 

Jennifer Bagwell - Apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not 
want to trade; would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk 
or operations

any of this in more depth.  ",Non Abusive

Subject: Re: TDS project  

I guess I have several comments to make to this string of mails....so why not 
add one more mail...

First off, Thomas is following up on my suggestion to check into TDS as when 
we met a few weeks ago (on other issues)  I heard about TDS by name for the 
first time - although I admit I was aware of work being done to replace the 
Applix functionality.  You had remarked that you liked the TDS functionality 
and wondered whether that was the way to go rather than continue to evolve 
excelr Grid.  It is unfortunate that Bill is not more cooperative with Thomas' 
request - more in the continuing saga of poor communication and information 
sharing between our two teams.
 
Clearly there needs to be much more communication and sharing of information 
as Global Rate Services for many months 'bowed' to the Sitara team's 
priorities for excelr Grid - which you now say probably won't be used.   There 
are many priorities in the wings to benefit the processes of Global Rate 
Services that without has caused us to continue to experience a high rate of 
errors - causing large impact to the P&L ($600,000 just the other day) and to 
the invoicing and payment processes.  

I have been proceeding under the impression excelr Grid was a shared 
application.  You clearly don't share that view as below you stated it is the 
responsibility of another group.  Is that why you dropped pursuit of excelr 
Grid and began developing TDS? 

Perhaps IT could meet deliverables if we provided them with a well 
thought-out plan and set of priorities, good communication, and solid project 
management.  To pursue separate solutions to try to save a struggling Sitara 
project may not have been the best answer.  We have exacerbated the IT 
resource problem by having three applications that overlap in functionality 
(Phoenix, MKM, and TDS) - oh, and pieces of ERMS too.  If that's the right 
answer, let's be sure we've discussed it before frivolously and selfishly 
pursuing our own solutions.  The 'users' you cite as knowing of TDS are not 
users at all - they are IT project managers.   Will you not have expectations 
of Global Rate Services to provide settled pricing as an input to derived 
curves ?  Will Global Rate Services responsibility end at the Phoenix door 
and it's someone else's problem if the price doesn't reflect correctly in 
TDS?  

Finally, it was certainly the intent that MKM would be the ultimate solution 
for all time series publishing in the organization-but I believe there is 
question as to whether it is the better technical solution and whether the 
design can fulfill the requirements. I wasn't aware that the pilot version of 
MKM contained any curve generation functionality.  It would be interesting to 
know how that got done, when ENA IT wasn't able to meet the basic 
deliverables of the MKM pilot.  Another disturbing element in all this 
regarding IT is - why IT did not raise a red flag that on the business side 
there were requests for overlapping functionality and conflicting priorities 
- you know, the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.

As all have said before me, a gap analysis needs to be done and a plan 
developed.  I look forward to increased communication and cooperation between 
our teams.

Subject: Re: TDS project  

Users outside of Sitara do know of TDS!  Yannis and his group have had 
discussions with Allen Severude's group regarding the TDS/Tibco 
infrastructure as well as review of ""current state"" excelr Grid.  Myself, 
Larrissa Sharma, Allan Severude, Steve Stock and Yannis have also had similar 
approach discussions.

Please note that a small portion of TDS is the replacement of the curve 
manager functionality that APPLIX currently provides (APPLIX is a trader 
tool).  There has been much user input on how the curve manager in TDS will 
be used.  Since excelrGrid/Rate Sever has not had an opportunity to handle the 
real-time (publish/subscribe) updates yet, it was suggested the 
infrastructure provided by TDS (i.e. Tibco) may be something to look.  Note 
that TDS is mentioned because of the infrastructure.  The functionality 
provided by the TDS curve manager does not encompass all the requirements 
outlined in the excelrGrid documents (functionality lacking the most is 
security, updating of ""Published"" pricing and the tie in to Rate Server -the 
TDS curve manager is built on ERMS pub/curve codes because all the trade data 
is TAGG).  Either way, the functionality that we have all been working 
through regarding how curves get published as well as subscribed to does not 
change.  Keep in mind that MKM also has curve generation functionality (to my 
knowledge, no one in Houston was part of this development). 

From a technical perspective, several items need to be addressed:

 Review/decision as to the technical direction of excelrGrid/Rate Server 
infrastructure and publish/subscribe real time development.
 Rate Server has no front end for curve generation.  excelrGrid was modified 
to provide this functionality; however excelrGrid is the responsibility of a 
different group
  (logically, this needs to come together under the same group).
 Does the TDS/Tibco infrastructure make sense (current excelrGrid/Rate Server 
design assumes the curves are always updated to the Rate Sever database and 
then    messaged from the database (potential performance impact); whereas 
Tibco infrastructure does not require a database update first)
 Does the MKM curve publish/subscribe supersede everything and provide a 
""better"" global technical solution (part of the London curve manager 
development team will be in
   Houston next week; therefore a briefing of the MKM curve manager is 
something that we are trying to get done).  Functionally, this will require a 
more vigorous gap
   analysis review before a decision can be made. 

I am open to additional discussions on the technical direction, but I do not 
think that alot of additional functional documentation needs to be done and 
timelines are not changing.

Bill,

I don't think anyone outside of Sitara knows of TDS.  If you could give 
myself and other interested parties a demo of TDS; I don't have a good 
understanding of the TDS project.   If the project is similar to the excelr 
Grid as it is indicated in Yannis's response, the business users need to come 
together and decide the system of choice.  Yannis makes good points of how to 
come to a decision. I would change that the users provide the important 
features, advantages, and shortcomings of each product as they see it.   I 
would gather the users' needs and timeline.  After deciding, I would then 
like to get IT involved to finalize a decision.  I would like to get the 
discussion started fairly soon due to the impeding business needs.  

The first thing I would suggest is have a demo of both products to inform all 
impacted business users.  Bill, can we setup a demo for tomorrow or early 
next week.

Subject: Re: TDS project  

Bill, 

I have had presentations of both of these projects (that is not to say that I 
know them well).

Since, according to Scott the choice is still open, we have to make a 
concious decision as to which way we go.  In my mind, this is a decision that 
has to be made by the user with my team's support.  I do not want and should 
not drive this decision.  The decision should be driven by the user, based on 
usage (business) requirements.  What the Phoenix group will provide is a 
server that does (or soon will) satisfy your business requirements.  The 
front end plug in is, I think,  a decoupled issue in a server-client 
environment.

On the other hand, I think we should help you with the choice (if you so want 
us).  I would actively consult with you to set up the choosing process, which 
I imagine would go somewhat like this:
I would suggest that we do, again and all deciding parties together,  get 
demos of each of these products. 
Business should put together a bullet point list of the functionality needed 
(even a timeline) and how the tool will be used so both Allan and Mike 
understand your needs clearly.
I also suggest that we ask TDS and excelr Grid  to provide us with a short 
document outlining the important features, advantages and shortcomings of 
each product as they see it.  Released features should be separated from 
future improvements; the latter should be be accompanied by a time line.  
Limitations should be listed explicitly.
We take our impressions from the demos along with the writeups in a room and 
make the decision.
If needed, business might have to spend the time to play with each of these 
products for a short period of time.

In my mind it is important to make choices like this one that will affect 
business for a long time based on enumerated and well understood facts (such 
that usually get lost from a short demo).

Please let me know what you think,

Yannis

Three people spoke at the meeting - Jeff McMahon, Louise and Philippe.  There 
was a lot of attention given to excelrOnline and it's success.  Greg Whalley 
spoke via satellite from London.  The basic theme was what it is going to 
take to survive in today's fast moving markets and how we are going to get 
there, and that in five years all businesses will be Internet companies or 
not companies at all.....  

Greg spoke briefly about what we were going to do to upgrade and expand 
existing platforms and the fact that no other player in the industry can do 
this but us because of our financial capabilities, reputation, and IT 
resources.  

Louise went over statistics, products offered, etc. on excelrOnline.

Philippe discussed all the IT projects in the works - the key one for ENA was 
enhancement of deal capture, valuation and settlements (no surprises 
there!).  One other common theme was streamlining our current systems.   He 
also confirmed the fact that we were moving from Lotus Notes to Exchange, and 
discussed the fact that we were running out of space in the building for our 
equipment (and the ability to keep the room cool) so they were looking to 
Ardmore for this.  

Jeff M. stated that we were looking for opportunities to capitalize on 
inefficiencies in the market, and get into other industries (e.g. MG Metals 
in Europe).  He also stated that excelr was going to Venture Capitalists for 
financial support and backing.  Of course, this means that excelr will have to 
give up some control, but it leads to increased deal flow, market share and 
new ideas....  He said the initial backing will be in the neighborhoods of 
$1B - most likely in Q3.  

I tried to capture the main topics, let me know if you have any questions!

require manual adjustment is an IM Canada position (60 K's) that will be 
fixed next Monday when Kam Keiser goes back to Calgary.  Everything else is 
now automatically feeding to the GRMS system (and VAR calculations) without 
human intervention.

Steve - Mike asked  me to send him a list of what we had done to improve the 
top-level adjustments on the Benchmark.  Here are the things which we 
discussed earlier.

Mike - Let me know if you need anything else.

We have lowered the number of top-level adjustments substantially this week.  
We have taken several steps in order to achieve this.

1.  We had to adjust formatting in all text files which go into GRMS.  
2.  We are using a flip-out book for all Canadian deals done with the U.S. 
office so that Canadian positions are pulling in correctly.
3.  We had to adjust many book names in order that GRMS would pull the books 
into the system.  
4.  We had to change region codes in the system so that GRMS would pull in 
more than one book per region.

Issues remaining:

Intra-Month Canada
Chicago
Storage and Intra-East

Intra-month Canada - We have a risk person from the U.S. office going to 
Canada on Monday to fix their problems.
Chicago -  will be fixed by the end of the day.  System is looking for the 
wrong portfolio code.
Storage and Intra-East - Also will be fixed by the end of the day.  Overide 
books need to be set up.

I concur that Brent's return to Houston will create a potential information

opportunity to keep your information level high and address my need to assess 
MG's remote offices.  If Brent were to linger in London for a few more 
months, we could lay out a program to assess MG's 24 offices around the world 
and benchmark their compliance with risk policies + procedures.  Brent's 
background and recent experience with Doorstep give him strong credentials 
for doing the job.  I haven't discussed this with MG's management, but it

set-up, and clean up.  I know these things require a great deal of effort, 
especially when you welcome people to your personal residence.  I want to,
and insist on helping in whatever way I can.  I am really grateful for what 
you have done for the University of Oklahoma and I am also aware of
the great sacrifices you make for excelr.  If possible, we might schedule a 
lunch to discuss the specifics.  I would also be grateful if we could discuss
my most recent opportunity at excelr,  Texas Risk.  I realize the there is a 
great deal I can gain from this move and I would appreciate any insight on how
to obtain the most from this experience.

Thanks

Leslie Reeves is working on the Tom Gros project (let me know if you need 
details on this).  She has asked for top 25 counterparties on excelrOnline.   
In short, there is a new Texas law in the works that will allow for 
electronic confirming of deals, and they want to determine if any of the top 
25 are Texas companies so that we can pursue confirming deals 
electronically.  

Just wanted to get your approval before sending it on to her.

As a vision statement this looks like an excellent place to start. You might 
want to think about the relationship between business units (EEL, EES and EBS 
- a little political, but what the hell) and with global risk management

All,

It appears that the Phoenix Rate Server was down for the time period in 
question.  Apparently some new Unix folks decided to clean up some files on 
the Phoenix box and deleted some Phoenix system files.  Phoenix only has 1 
support person and he is out on vacation.  Someone from the Sitara production 
support team was able to restart the system today and the extract was rerun.  
We are currently re-running the mass draft to pick up the new rates.  We 
should be good to go for Tuesday 6:00 am.

Subject: Phoenix Rate Server Problems

All,

It appears that we have not been picking up rates from Phoenix since December 
24th (the job was finishing, just not picking up any rates).  At first glance 
the problem may be related to our losing access to the Phoenix server.  We 
plan on the following action:

1) Run the mass drafts as planned tonight.
2) Determine and fix the cause of the problem with the rate server load on 
Monday, January 1st.  The rate server load process will then be rerun for the 
missing time periods. 
3) Rerun the current month mass drafts for all gas entities on Monday, 
January 1st.  Prior months should not be affected.
4) Put better detective controls in place to make sure any problems in the 
future get identified as they occur.

Chris

Thanks again for the positive feedback. Members of your team were 
instrumental to the success -- specifically Jeff Sorensen, Bob Klein, Becky 
Ford and Melissa White.  I'm talking with Beth about the possibility that we 
might recognize key people on the team with some sort of 'project success' 
bonus. 


Below, I've attached an invitation to a meeting that we've scheduled for 
Wednesday. We will present plans for 5 immediate projects that we're 
proposing to address Unify issues. Let us know if you'd like to attend. Also, 
please forward names of anyone that should attend that we've missed. 

Thanks.

Further to our discussion on Friday I summarise my view of Joe Gold's issues 
with the MO control process

Joe expressed some frustration with the current status as follows: -

The DPR has historically been 'filled with noise' around adjustments for 
edits on trades, provision restatements etc which negates it's effectiveness 
for him as a control/supervisory report 
The risk team appear to have been reacting to p&l 'noise'  - particularly 
around transmission adjustments rather than proactively finding booking 
solutions - or instructing IT to flex Enpower
Settlements have gained a perception in the market place for 'errors' such 
that originators are informing Joe that business is being 'lost' due to our 
perceived inability to support transactions - ( must be careful here as no 
specifics on errors have been provided )
The risk team ( post Neil Tarling's transfer to EBS ) is relatively junior 
and does not possess many 'years' of experience of Power support
James New as Power,Gas and Credit Controller has ( necessarily ) too broad a 
role for him to focus on these detailed issues

In mitigation

The recent continental book split ( which is only now being 'settled' in to 
the daily process) and the clean up of historic provisions/reserves prior to 
Neil Tarling's transfer has exaggerated the base issue around certainty of 
daily p&l
Designing an approximate booking process for transmission has not been a top 
priority for the risk team in the recent past ( this was either wrong or the 
prioritisation call  was not  effectively communicated to Joe ) - and it is 
felt that there are no IT resources to code  these solutions to Enpower ( 
also London struggles to influence Houston IT resource prioritisation )
The settlements infrastructure has been supporting a business volume growth 
it is not designed for and supporting acitivity on this platform requires 
'skilled' staff ( we are down on resources for Continental Power ) - 
continuing growth in volumes are expected along with junior settlement staff 
being asked to join Commercial groups
We are  experiencing  generational  change as a result of Barry's move to EBS 
- resourcing is James and my top priority

I believe what Joe is asking for, is what we are trying to provide - namely :

upgrade in resourcing in the risk group where we are insisting that the lead 
individual has full responsibility, end to end, for the business including 
the assessment of operational risk and effectiveness of the business process,
focus on identifying and implementing the necessary quick hit solutions that 
eliminates 'manual workarounds' and consequently 'noise' in the process
more proactive communication with Commercial - especially to manage 
expectations
a definitive plan for how the strategic upgrade in applications architecture 
for MO will benefit/change his business support

However, we are behind in finding the 'right' replacement for Neil ( one with 
experience and breadth of view potential ), we have found a continental power 
settlemetns manager but he does not arrive until July 3 rd, we have been 
struggling with book split when that should have been completed a month ago 
and it is taking time to get all the ducks lined up re our plans for 
Enlighten/DTL/EnVoice/Autoconfirms/DCAF - hence his frustration about lost 
business opportunities NOW!!

Hence I would love to find someone who could deliver the above ( ie be Neil 
Tarling's replacement ) or could assist us in
providing and communicating the judgement calls on transmission and other 
adjustments - so improving perception of C.P. DPR
prioritising and influencing Enpower development agenda ( along with others )
project manage issues around 'unstable' documentation and settlement process 
vis a vis client sensitivity
provide leadership in changing expectations/perceptions

I'm sorry for the length of the note but it may help you in determining a 
'best fit' person 

Please call if any of the above is unclear.

Mike

Thanks, Bjorn.

A few weeks back, Sydney started executing their own Confirms, where in the 
past, it had been done in Houston by myself.   Since I have not heard of this 
from Houston, I would not be doing my job if I let this go unquestioned.  I 
assume this is a policy change?

They are also making advances towards becoming an Asian hub.   As such, there 
are a few responsibilities that I currently handle, which Sydney is looking 
to take over:
 - Houston independently reconciles the broker statements daily;   the 
Settlements Clerk could handle;
 - All settlements are approved by me in Houston;  the new Settlements Clerk 
could handle this as well, or someone 
   in Houston could signoff on payment before Treasury takes action.

I guess I'm looking for assurances that Sydney is supposed to become a hub, 
and some information on exactly how autonomous they should become.   Are they 
to be completely independent, or are there to be a minimum level of controls 
between offices?

They are a very busy company, in much demand both within excelr and other 
companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September 
21-22.

Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October 
onwards - but that may be less of a fit).

How does this fit with your group?
Let me know if you want to discuss this further

the integration team=01,s accomplishments to date.

What is MG Plc?
MG Plc is a leading, independent international metals trading business, whi=

provide market-making and trading services to the MG=01,s physical metals=
=20
trading business through futures trading as a member of the London Metal=20
Exchange and, at a later date, as a member of COMEX in New York.  In the la=
te=20
1980s, as a result of London=01,s growing leading role in the metals indust=
ry,=20
MG established a merchant trading office in London.  In 1986, MG developed=
=20
its warehousing division with the acquisition of Henry Bath.  In 1999, the=
=20
Merchanting and Financial Services Divisions, including warehousing, were=
=20
combined into a single company, which was floated on the London Stock=20
Exchange.  Currently, MG=01,s core trading offices are located in London an=
d New=20
York with warehouse operations in Liverpool, Humberside, Rotterdam, New=20
Orleans, New Haven, and Singapore. It has merchanting offices in Lima,=20
Santiago, Los Angeles, Chicago, Stockholm, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, New=
=20
Delhi, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo and Melbourne.

What does the Merchanting Division do?
The Merchanting Division is the world=01,s leading independent copper merch=
ant,=20
one of the top three independent merchants of copper concentrates and nicke=
l=20
and one of the leading European merchants of recycled non-ferrous metals. T=
he=20
division also trades in other non-ferrous metals on the London Metals=20
Exchange (LME), including lead, tin, zinc, aluminium and brass.

The Merchanting Division engages in the following main activities:

? Merchanting of Non-ferrous Metals =01) MG trades as a principal with prod=
ucers=20
and consumers, buying and selling non-ferrous metals and concentrates=20
(particularly copper, aluminium and nickel), exchanging qualities and=20
locations and lending and borrowing metals.
? Global Stockholding =01) MG holds stocks of non-ferrous metals at warehou=
ses=20
around the world.
? Merchanting of Recycled Metal =01) MG trades as a principal with supplier=
s and=20
consumers of non-ferrous metal for recycling.
? Terminal Market Operations =01) MG participates in the LME and COMEX usin=
g=20
hedging, arbitrage and position management to support its merchanting=20
activity.

What does the Financial Services Division do?
The Financial Services Division is one of the leading LME members and, base=
d=20
on the volume of LME metals stored, is one of the leading LME metals=20
warehousing businesses.

The Financial Services Division engages in the following main activities:

? Brokerage Activities =01) MG executes orders as a broker for clients in L=
ME=20
and COMEX contracts.
? Market-Making =01) MG is a market-maker for both futures and options cont=
racts=20
and COMEX and OTC contracts.
? Warehousing =01) MG stores metals and other goods in eleven locations in=
=20
Europe, the United States and Asia.

MG has also begun to prepare to trade non-ferrous metals using the internet=
=20
as its platform.  On 10th February, MG announced the formation of a joint=
=20
venture with Internet Capital Group, Inc. and Safeguard International Fund,=
=20
L.P. to develop an internet marketplace for trading non-ferrous metals. The=

joint venture, called EMETRA, intends to establish a world-wide=20
business-to-business, e-commerce trading platform for the non-ferrous metal=
s=20
markets, including physical trading and the trading of futures and options=
=20
contracts.

Why is excelr acquiring MG?
excelr is committed to expanding its position as a global leader in wholesal=
e=20
markets. By expanding into new wholesale markets, such as non-ferrous metal=
s,=20
excelr expects to leverage its wholesale expertise and will be able to offer=
=20
customers new products and solutions to address their business needs which=
=20
link different commodities and inputs.

MG will provide excelr with a number of important benefits.  At the same tim=
e,=20
excelr expects that MG will significantly benefit from its association with=
=20
excelr.  Some of the benefits we envisage include:

? The opportunity to combine excelr=01,s core competencies in trading, finan=
ce=20
and origination with MG=01,s global position in trading non-ferrous metals.

? The ability for both excelr and MG to access new clients, particularly in=
=20
the United States and Europe.

? The ability to cross-market both existing products and new products such =
as=20
bundled products that offer combined metals and power outsourcing.

? The ability to leverage the opportunities available to MG by increasing i=
ts=20
financial strength and the resources available to it.

? The chance to overlay the excelrOnline business-model on the metals indust=
ry=20
to increase liquidity and contract market share.

What remains to be done?
Merging the business operations of two entities, even highly motivated=20
companies such as excelr and MG, has been and will continue to be a formidab=
le=20
and daunting exercise.  Having a shared vision facilitates rapid integratio=
n,=20
but there are many complicated and complex tasks that remain.  During the=
=20
conditional offer period, excelr and MG are taking steps to prepare for a=20
seamless and non-disruptive integration of our respective operations. =20
Ideally, when excelr=01,s offer to buy all MG shares becomes unconditional (=
15=20
July 2000 is the current target date), the two can hit the ground with thei=
r=20
feet running.

In the short term, a number of things must be accomplished to facilitate th=
at=20
smooth transition.  Most importantly, in order to ensure that the deal goes=
=20
forward, excelr and MG will work to remove the remaining conditions to excelr=
=01,s=20
offer, including obtaining the shareholder approvals from all shareholders =
as=20
well as obtaining relevant regulatory consents.

A number of other steps must be taken, however, during the first phase of o=
ur=20
integration timetable to ensure that everything stays on track.  Integratio=
n=20
activities will focus on four primary aspects of our operations: commercial=
=20
matters, financial matters, middle and back office issues; and, most=20
importantly, on the employees of both organisations.  Some of the most=20
important goals relating to each of these areas are:

Commercial
? Developing physical metal contracts suitable for listing on excelrOnline a=
nd=20
installing necessary communication and technology links to facilitate data=
=20
transfers and information flows between MG and excelr.
? Preparing a joint venture management plan for MG's interest in EMETRA tha=
t=20
is consistent with excelr=01,s goal of listing physical metal contracts on=
=20
excelrOnline.
? Identifying opportunities to
- combine excelr's core competencies in trading, finance, and origination wi=
th=20
MG's global position in trading non-ferrous metals;
- leverage MG=01,s position by increasing its financial strength and resour=
ces=20
available to it;
- cross-market both existing and new products to excelr and MG customers,=20
particularly in the US and Europe; and
- grow MG's metal trading franchise.

Financial
? Obtaining waivers from MG's banks in respect of change of control in loan=
=20
or other agreements.
? Preparing plans to integrate cash management functions and putting in pla=
ce=20
funding arrangements for August 2000 onwards.
? Preparing plans to arrange large-scale inventory securitisation to reduce=
=20
balance sheet debt before year-end.

Middle and Back Office
? Preparing financial information necessary to understand and maximise=20
integration benefits including, pro-forma consolidated financial statements=
;=20
profit and loss budgets for the third and fourth quarters of 2000; and=20
integration budgets.
? Determining the feasibility of integrating accounting systems (AS400, SAP=
).
? Assessing  MG's core trading and risk profiles and developing plans to=20
incorporate risk profiles in MG's metals books into excelr systems. =20
? Evaluating IT systems and infra-structure at all MG office + warehouse=20
locations and preparing budgets and programmes to provide MG staff with=20
access to excelr IT systems and applications.

People
? Preparing a programme to co-locate MG's London staff (145) at excelr House=
=20
over the weekend of 16/17 September.
? Developing plans to harmonize compensation, benefits, and employment=20
policies and practices; developing plans for staff reporting relationships.
? Communicating plans and status of activities at all levels of excelr's and=
=20
MG's organizations.
? Arranging introductions between excelr and MG staff and providing=20
opportunities for information exchanges.

Where do we go from here?
I believe that excelr=01,s acquisition of MG is an exciting opportunity for =
us=20
all.  While a number of steps remain to be taken, we have already=20
successfully begun the integration of excelr and MG.  By remaining=20
enthusiastic and committed to this process, I expect that this transition=

will proceed smoothly and with a minimum of difficulty.

more smoothly, whether you are implementing financials and HR or HR only.  
Here is one way.

Timekeeping, though it seems mundane on the surface, is a focal point of the 
SAP integration.  Entry and coding of time populates not just payroll, but 
projects and cost centers, real time.  We will now have more flexibility to 
charge employee and contractor time to the areas they actually work (where 
people work on more than one area at a time).  This will only happen to the 
extent that the business and cost center owners drive it.  This capability is 
customizable not just by business unit or company, but by cost center within 
a company.

To make this work HOW YOU WANT IT TO on 7/1, each ""organizational unit"" (as I 
said above, you can drive this in your cost center(s) only or across your BU) 
needs to be clear on questions such as:

1.  Whether or not they want contractors to enter time in SAP
2. Whether you want positive timekeeping (each pay period specifying the cost 
center or projects one worked on) or ""exceptions"" only (e.g., vacation, sick 
time, etc)
3.  Whether an approval process is desired and if so, what it is
4.  Whether people will record their own time using the self service 
capability eHROnline (typically more precise and less handoffs) or whether 
they will continue to use a timekeeper (typically a little more convenient 
for people who (a)  rarely have access to a computer or (b) work in many 
different areas and are not willing/able to identify and use cost center 
numbers or project codes 
5.  Whether people  know the projects and cost center codes they should 
charge to

Your leadership in clarifying this within your cost center and/or BU will be 
instrumental in driviing the level of change you desire, as well as 
minimizing the noise related to the 7/1 go -live.  We have been using a 
variety of methods to communicate and drive much of this change, but the 
business drive for how much to utilize the tool is determined by you.

The deadline for the first SAP time entry period is 3 pm Houston time on 
Friday, June 30.

Despite all our collective efforts, I expect that it will be a few pay 
periods before we get each individual clear on what level of acitivity is 
desired from him by his cost center or company.  Thanks for your help in 
getting through the transition period.  Please call me or Andrea Yowman if 
you have any questions.  
",Non Abusive
28964,beck-s/discussion_threads/1229.,<29238012.1075855837291.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"As you know, we have substantially wrapped up our work related to this 
project.  Today, we are making what I hope are final changes to the maps and 
deliverables, with the anticipation that we will deliver to you complete 
binders by Wednesday.  

One issue that we wanted to communicate relates to the use of manual payment 
processes and the risk that processing manual payments presents in the 
automated Unify/SAP environment.  This issue was raised by Melissa during our 
discussion of the manual cash reconciliation effort caused by the inability 
of SAP to auto-match cash receipts and disbursements in situations where the 
money has moved or been received, but the corresponding JE has not been made 
in SAP.  Both Melissa and Cindy Morrow have been involved in subsequent 
discussions related to the below-mentioned risks. 

1.  Risk of JE and payment duplication:

Payments taken directly to Treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in 
Unify:
 In the event that the transaction giving rise to the manual payment is 
entered initially into Unify (which would be the case for all normal 
commodity payments, excluding broker fee and broker margin payment 
transactions), a risk exists that the payment could be recorded and paid 
twice (once by either A/P or Treasury when the manual payment is wired and 
subsequently recorded, and once during the normal Unify to SAP interface).  
Process controls will be put in place to mitigate this risk; however, all 
controls will be people-based, not system-based.  It is too late to rebuild 
the Unify to SAP interface to better address the use of manual payments.  One 
additional suggestion might be to work with each group to reduce the use of 
manual payments except under well-defined, important circumstances.

Payments taken to Treasury, and underlying transaction is recorded directly 
to SAP (does not go through Unify):
If the payment is not entered into SAP with payment method ""J"", A/P will not 
realize that the payment has already been made and will process the 
disbursement a second time.

2.  Risk of understated expense:

Payments taken to Treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in Unify:
For manual payments that are not finalized in Unify (a process performed in 
the system to mark an invoice as final) by month-end (but the disbursement 
has already happened), expense will be understated.

Payments taken to Treasury, and underlying transaction is recorded directly 
to SAP (does not go through Unify):
If payment is not input into SAP by month-end but cash has moved, expense 
will be understated.  (Cash outflow account will show a credit balance which 
will be flipped to A/P, but no income statement entry will be made at that 
time.)

3.  Risk of cash misappropriation:

In addition to the above risks related to the use of manual payments, we also 
believe that a risk exists related to the use of Excel-generated counterparty 
invoices and the lack of segregation between the person responsible for 
preparing these invoices and also for handling/having access to the related 
accounting records.  We believe that it may be possible for a settlements 
coordinator to change the bank routing instructions or bank account number on 
the Excel invoice mailed to the counterparty and then manipulate the 
accounting records during the cash application process to either write off 
the account balance or to reflect the receivable as being paid while 
constantly moving cash application balances from one counterparty to another 
(so that no one account balance ages past an acceptable range).  We have been 
unable to determine a set of control procedures that would mitigate this risk.

4.  Revision to counterparty banking details:

We are currently investigating the procedure performed by Treasury when 
problems with bank account details cause payments to kick-out of Treasury 
workstation.  If the risk of misappropriation exists related to this 
procedure, we will separately communicate.

The above may be unclear.  If so, we would be glad to sit down with you for 
15 minutes or so and clarify.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

We didn't really cover the role you intended to play with EES and EBS as far 
as Doorstep is concerned when we met with Causey/Buy.  (Or I just can't

project, and continue to work with Shona, also coordinating with Wanda and 
Barry when EES and EBS are involved?  Things like the event below might make

VALUE AT RISK

The Value at Risk (VaR) seminar is designed to introduce participants to this 
important concept.  An understanding of VaR is rapidly becoming an integral 
business need.  The first session of this seminar provides participants with 
a comprehensive review of statistics, these being the primary building block 
of VaR itself.  The program then moves on to identify examples of the context 
in which clients are using VaR in their business decisions.  Participants 
will gain an understanding of the interrelationship of the many factors that 
make VaR a dynamic and strategic tool.  The program ends with a ""hands on"" 
experience of making a simple VaR calculation.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Give a precise definition of Value at Risk
Describe how VaR is changing the way companies evaluate risk in their 
businesses
Discuss how these changing views of risk will impact the use of hedging  
products
Recognize why companies are implementing VaR
Explain the key factors in calculating VaR
Understand the need to categorize risk into ""Risk Buckets""
Define the standardizing practice of Risk Mapping
Illustrate a simple VaR model and accurately discuss the modeling         
process
Calculate a simple two product VaR number
Demonstrate the difference between the Historical, Monte Carlo and Risk 
Metrics  approaches to VaR
Evaluate the impact of correlation on the calculation of VaR
Understand the application and importance of stress testing",Non Abusive

Subject: For Discussion: Implementing Definition of Trading Office

I was going to write that the buying and selling of physical commodity 
locally was OK, but that hedging had to be done with Regional Hub. The 
problem with this model is that it describes Helsinki before the bust!

Another possiblity is the agency model, where the local trader acts under the 
direction of the hub trader. This is where Helsinki currently is (although we 
also have an independent manager on site). However, I am not so happy with 
this, and Rick Causey certainly does not like it. Perhaps we should recommend 
independent Risk Managers in every office, but all correspondence and 
settlement with regional hub?

more detailed.  I may not have given you a copy as you were on vacation 
during my last week.  I did have lunch with Fernley at which time I 
communicated these concerns and future projects.  Also, I met with James New, 
Paul Mead, and Gregor Baumerich on an individual basis and delivered the same

After reading your e-mail to Sally, I composed the second file entitled 
""Continental Power Summary.doc.""  This file is a summarized, one-page list of 
issues with which you, Joe, and I are concerned (as well as Sally and Fernley 
of course).  The arrows below each section points out the potential risk that 
we are really talking about.

Subject: Merlin - AA Due Diligence - Final Draft Report

Please find attached a final draft copy of the due diligence report for MG.  
During the work performed AA did not identify any material issues that excelr 
would need to be concerned about prior to the voting that is to take place 
this Friday.  The final report will be presented to me by early next week.  I 
will forward to you a copy at that time.  AA has assured me that no 
additional items of a significant nature will be added to the final report 
that are not already included in the final draft document.

If you have any questions/comments on the report please do not hesitate to 
give me a call.

Thanks

General Status of the Database model: 
 FIX not represented - need to incorporate into common design and standardize 
- might cause some FIX rework.
 Referential Integrity not entirely enforced  - potential for bad data to 
develop. 
 Snapshots from Global databases are currently daily - this can be easily 
changed to be more frequent, but need to consider implementation as 
decision   on direction of Global as a part of Commodity Logic is made. 
 Rate information not developed - need integration with Rate Server or MKM, 
preferably MKM. Need to define how MKM will be used-whether just for index  
names or to obtain actual settlement prices or curves as well.
 Application development is not currently occurring on a single version of 
the database.  Therefore, some issues could arise as each development team   
migrates to the standard. This needs to happen relatively quickly.

Specific Issues:
 GFD_PIPE_METERS_SNP -  Probably need to add FAC_TYPE (WH, ITE, etc) for 
possible use as validation in KX functionality
 GAS_DEAL_LOCATION_DTL -  This table refers to facility number rather than 
pipe and meter.  Facility number is an excelrism that no other company 
will      recognize.  
 Pipe and Meter General -   Should try to avoid using Pipe_Cd as key.  This 
value needs to be updateable as pipelines are bought and sold.
    -   Data for Facilities is heavily dependent upon excelr Global Facilities 
Database in current design and functionality-this      needs revisiting as 
the decision surrounding Global is made 
 CP_ADDR_VW  - This table references only internal_cp_id and contact_type_cd 
in conjunction with address_id.  Addresses are specific to      
internal_cp_id, product_cd, deal_nature_cd, contact_type_cd, and region_cd.  
Need to add deal nature, product, and      region to ensure correct address 
usage since many companies align their business along these determinants 
and      addresses may vary
 COUNTERPARTY - There is a mixture of the usage of Global Counterparty.  Some 
areas indicate a certain amount of independence from      excelr's Global 
Counterparty system, by having a table to capture Commodity Logic information 
on a counterparty such      as phone numbers, credit ratings, etc. This would 
position CL to become independent at a later date.  Yet, Commodity      Logic 
functions as a subset of excelr Networks and GCP must make entries to indicate 
the usage of a customer by excelr      Networks to obtain an SAP id and 
support payment processing through to SAP.  So, CL could not become 
independent      without further functionality or process changes.  So why 
not put the added data requirements within GCP to start with?   If      
Global moves to Commodity Logic, then this design needs to be revisited for 
sure.  There should probably be some      standardization between 
dependence/independence whether or not CL separates from excelr. 
 Common Data  - Status is not included in the views being utilized by the 
applications.  I hope the views have been filtered for active       status 
only.  Show was going to check on this.
    - Concept of mapping others' codes to ours for processing, is not 
supported anywhere in these tables.  Perhaps       that has been handled in 
an isolated manner in the FIX design? This will have to be there for internal 
release as well as      external release.  This is critical to the hub 
concept.

I look forward to sitting in on your meetings surrounding these issues.  Let 
me know if you have further questions.

Yesterday Debbie and I stepped the P&P group through the Doorstep findings. 
We set the scene, went through the report item by item, and put the findings 
into context, e.g. learning points from Coal.

Collectively, we are comfortable that required actions have been implemented. 

At present the group are on the cusp of transitioning from an origination 
group feeding deals into the Houston risk book, into a fully fledged trading 
unit with physical assets in Europe. Riveria - a potential acquisition of two 
paper mills in Southern France - and/or other acquisitions would be the 
catalyst for this transition.

The group are currently assessing their Commercial, Support and other 
infrastructure resource requirements in order to manage this growth in a 
controlled way. I have sent them the attachment - Roles & Responsibilities 
matrix for Global - which has recently been tailored for a presentation Mike 
Jordan will be making to MG, and will try to stick close and help them 
through this process.

our hands.   Here are some of the facts:

excelr in Houston is closed on both Monday and Tuesday, July 3rd and 4th.  
The NYMEX is closed both days as well.  
Equity markets are closed on Tuesday, July 4th but are open on Monday, July 
3rd.  
excelr Europe is open for business on both days.
Technically, the first work day following the month-end is Wednesday, July 
5th for the Houston office.

Given the facts above, the following will be the month-end process:

QUARTER-END PROCESS:
Final quarter-end information is due to my team by 5 PM on Wednesday, July 
5th.  
No adjustments < $250,000 will be processed after 5 PM on Wednesday.
Adjustments > $250,000 require approval from John Lavorato or John Sherriff.
A final DPR for the quarter ended June 30, 2000 will be issued by 
approximately noon on Thursday, July 6.

JULY DPR REPORTING:
NO DPR will be issued dated July 3, 2000.
For divisions reporting P&L for July 3rd and/or July 4th, a ""Special DPR"" 
will be issued on July 5th.  This ""Special DPR"" will not have a year-to-date 
column.  This is due to the fact that quarter-end information will not be 
completed prior to issuing the ""Special DPR"".    For consolidated DPR 
purposes, July 3rd and July 4th will be combined and reported as one day.  
These combined days will be reported as July 4th.  Please report each of 
these days separately.  Once the final quarter-end DPR is completed, the 
regular DPRs for July business will be updated and reported, replacing any 
""Special DPRs"" previously reported.  This process is necessary to enable 
reporting of current daily information until the final quarter-end DPR is

discussed in the meeting this morning.  

As far as Xref1 (coordinator) and Xref2 (physical vs. financial flag) fields 
go, it appears that we are getting what we have to have in order to go live 
7/1.  Rena was working on a spec (the OSS that was discussed) that would 
automatically populate these 2 fields.  However, the test was unsuccessful.  
These two fields are being opened up for netting, so we can input them 
manually when netting.  I believe we need to pursue the auto fill post 7/1, 
but the first priority is having a place to put the data.

As far as settlement period is concerned, we are probably going to get a 
hybrid of what we want at this time.  The SAP team does appear to have 
appropriate resources working on this issue.  For data created in SAP, I am 
more comfortable that the data is being captured on the income statement side 
of the entry, and the SAP folks now seem to think they can link over to it to 
get the settlement data.  For data converted, we will not be able to get the 
settlement period in the same manner.  The offsetting entry in conversion is 
to a dummy conversion account rather than an income statement account.  The 
dummy account doesn't carry the settlement date.  Another issue is related to

Subject: Re: Revised Operating Standards  

Steve

My assessment of the next steps are as follows :-

We finalise the intial draft of the one page summary  - Action Mike/Brent to 
consolidate feedback to date - to be delivered tomorrow
The one pager to be sent to all business heads commenting on John's belief ( 
which I think we all share ) that the Business unit head has ultimate 
responsibility to ensure operating standards are met and that we aim to 
provide them with a joint summary of 'status' from Commercial Support and 
RAC. This summary could be reviewed by AA, but I believe the process would be 
more beneficial if it is 
a self assessment process
escalates judgement on material issues 
capable of being monitored and repeated on an agreed frequency
complimentary to the BRM process
The timeline for thie intial feedback could be within one week - I have an 
assessment from David Port to match to ours already!

As to your other questions

I will be adding two additional detail points within the required structure 
definition - ie the structure must have :-

Full functionality and interfaces for market risk, credit risk and Corporate 
reporting, and/or a systems roadmap for that development
Appropriate involvement in business for specialist services ( Legal, Tax and 
HR )

The Operating Standards MUST only cover one page to retain the ease of 
communication for them - the above definitions identify that businesses must 
consider all Legal and RAC issues - and there will significant detail 
involved in that - which will be defined elsewhere ( see David's separate 
comments on risk reporting )

In summary I think it is best to move to publish the intial draft to 
stimulate communication  - would welcome your thoughts

Mike

Subject: Re: Revised Operating Standards  

Mike: 

Is this the most current version of the proposed Operating Standards?  Since 
I've been out of the office since we last discussed, I wanted to get an 
update on the status.  A couple of questions: 

What are the next steps? 
How will this be communicated and to whom?
How do you see this being implemented to best assure it is respected?
Legal Standards are absent?  I suspect this is still in draft form and they 
are to follow in the next version; however, let me know how you see legal 
Standards playing into this as I believe they should be on this list as well.

As discussed, I strongly believe that a brief and clear list of ""absolutes"" 
similar to the attachment will be most useful if first agreed by all that 
need to be involved and then effectively communicated and respected by all in 
EEL.  Let me know if this list is now considered representative of the views 
of all that need to have input.  I suggest we meet again with a broader group 
to assure this list is complete and to discuss next steps.  I have some 
suggested adjustments but will get back to you by end of week with comments 
or questions from RAC after we discuss this in our weekly RAC manager's 
meeting.   

Thanks,

Steve

Subject: TAGG modification request

Ron,

A series of significant events took place this week where it made it more 
apparent that a modification in Tagg is highly needed.   Without going into a 
lot of detail regarding the events, the modification desired is simply an 
Expiration Date field for certain types of transactions (Swaptions), where a 
date is keyed by the user at the time the trade is entered into TAGG.  In 
addition, this feature will permit TAGG to prompt the user or users with a 
message box of the Expiration date and associated Deal Number at a later 
time, before the expiration date becomes current (i.e. a week before the 
expiration date becomes current).  

This request carries a lot of value for it allows ENA to avoid a variety of 
risks underlying missing execution of certain types of trades.  This issue 
was addressed in the past and I would like to raise it again.

Can we implement such modification? Your prompt response is highly needed and 
your feedback is appreciated.  

Thanks.

Subject: EnLighten Inception document - Executive Summary.  

All
Many thanks for your comments of the draft, I have incorporated these into 
the first version attached below.
As mentioned, this is a 'light' version without all the individual feed 
details and system names etc. intended as an summary for sign-off.
I will tidy up the heavy version so that it can be used to build the 
Elaboration and Planning documents.
Mike is going to present this to Fernley and to Sally Beck for discussion on 
his trip to Houston next week.
I will send to Beth for her sign off.
We need to consider how to wrap Mark Pickering in and to ensure his support, 
booking EnLighten's place on the IT priority list.
Any comments welcome.
Thanks & Regards

29030,beck-s/discussion_threads/1289.,<14370676.1075855838702.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"There are clearly a large number of people who need to know what is happening 
on the integration of the MG metals business and a large number of fluid 
teams working on different aspects of the project; however, most issues 
related to the integration process will only be of interest to a subset of 
the people involved.

We currently have two main forums for information sharing available to 
members of the integration team:

The weekly newsletter produced by Fiona Grant in PR, which from 30 June 
onwards will be sent to EEL management and the heads of those departments 
represented on the Integration Team.
A weekly meeting on Friday mornings from 8am to 9am in NW1006, which has been 
put in place to provide team leaders with an opportunity to update the entire 
integration team on their top two or three issues for the past and/or coming 
week.  

For now, I expect the weekly update and the weekly meetings to meet the 
information needs of the integration team.  If you feel this is not adequate, 
then let either myself or Fiona Grant know and we'll do a re-think on the 
subject.

To this end, and in the interests of ensuring that we conclude our discussion 
in the allotted time, the following are a few organisational points I would 
like everyone to bear in mind when attending the Friday morning meeting:

Attendees should distinguish between presenters and audience at the weekly 
meeting. 
Presenters should attend if at all possible and, in the event they are unable 
to attend, should nominate a replacement for the meeting (replacements should 
be notified to Esther Gerratt in advance of the  Friday morning meeting if 
possible).

For the time being, presenters and their designated areas are:

- Eric Gadd  Commercial and Acquisition progress
- Amita Gosalia  EOL
- Justin Boyd  Legal
- Toby Knight  Premises
- Barry Sangster  IT infrastructure
- Bob Campbell  IT applications
- Richard Sage  Middle and Back Offices and Project Management
- Lloyd Fleming  RAC
- Tim Davies  Credit
- Anne Edgley  Finance
- Anne Hicks  Cash Management
- Janine Juggins  Tax
- Andrea Kerch  US GAAP and Due diligence
- Nigel Sellens  HR
- Fiona Grant  PR
- Bruce Garner  Business Development 
 
As  this is intended to be an ""update""-only meeting, any unresolved 
substantive issues are to be taken off-line and the resolution reported the 
following week. 
Lastly, I would request that presenters focus on communicating, in an 
efficient manner, things which affect other functions within the integration 
process.  Doing so will assit other presenters in relaying the information 
presented at the meeting to other personnel in their respective areas.

I hope you find this useful.   We want to keep the information flowing as we 
continue the integration process, but at the same time we need to make sure 
we use our time wisely and efficiently.

Regards,
Eric",Non Abusive

I hope to complete an efficient/judgemental assessment internally for all

Subject: SAP and Seller Rules!!!! Please read

All,

July 1, SAP goes into effect for us here in Houston.  Also, the seller rules 
principle comes into play.  This means that if we (the IR/FX desk) owe you a 
payment in USD, GBP or EUR, you MUST book the payable in SAP to company 0967 
(we are no longer company 1Y3).  We then go into SAP and remove the block and 
that allows the payment to be sent.  

Per Corp., all intercompany trades are to be handled in this  manner.  This 
means that when you are paying us any of the 3 above currencies, we will go 
into SAP and book a payable to your company.  Going forward, when confirming 
settlements with Ana, you must be prepared to provide her with your company 
number.  You are then responsible for going into SAP and removing the block 
to allow payments to be released.  

Is SIFT UK interfacing directly to SAP, or will you manually be booking these 
entries?  If you are interfacing, the payable entry should automatically be 
created.  If you are  manually booking into SAP, you will need to coordinate 
with your accounting/reporting contacts to make sure that all of this goes 
smoothly.  If you are not the person who will be manually booking the entries 
into SAP, please forward this message to the appropriate person.

change to the legal entity we'll use for the ""trading"" portion of 
Clickpaper.com activity.
   As long as our business model is a one to many model the decision is......
a. For Click Match activity Clickpaper.com can still be used as planned.  
Simply, we'll only be invoicing for transaction fees.
b. For Click Trade activity the following will happen.
 1.  Physical trading that occurs at any North American Hub developed by 
Clickpaper.com, excelr North America, Corp. (ENA) will be the        
confirming entity.  I  have asked legal to develop a simple recital statement 
for the physical confirmation to indicate that the transaction originated as 
a         ""Clickpaper.com on-line transaction"".   
 2.  Physical trading that occurs at any Hub developed for the U.K., Latin 
America, or Asia, has not yet been finalized for legal entity purposes.  My 
desire is       that we follow the legal entity structure used by EOL on-line 
trading for Hubs in similar countries.  We'll work that out soon.

Strictly from an operational point of view the benefits are many but the most 
significant is a much simplified mid/back-office effort in order to support 
Clickpaper on-line business.  We no longer need to be concerned about setting 
up more portfolio/book i.d.'s for risk books as on-line deals can go into the 
same risk books used today for pulp and paper.  Intercompany transactions 
between Clickpaper.com and ENA are now eliminated for on-line trades which 
simplifies the confirmation support as well as the downstream financial 
reporting/reconcilation activity that would be required by using 
Clickpaper.com as the entity.  

If our one to many model is successful, we move to a many to many model.  At 
that point, all of this changes.  So for now, ENJOY!

power port calc.  The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the 
message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months 
now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday 
(excelr holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and 
should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six 
times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by 
4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a 
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders 
by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact on 
our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution 
of this problem.
Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower 
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.  
I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing 
business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the 
agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense 
or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to 
another server.
Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

Subject: athena vs quark

With regards to the message below, we must have athena (server) to run our 
nightly risk books for the power group.  We run one of our three east power 
calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solution 
for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken 
away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We 
usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5 
hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful 
completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building 
when the calc crashes at 4:30.
Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the 
last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable.
We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our 
system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense 
of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden 
today about these problems. 
I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted 
with the finger pointing between different IT groups.
Thanks.

Subject: SAP / Global/ Unify replication problem on Friday June 30th


On Friday June 30th, Unify's production performance was impacted by a large 
volume (30k) of replication/ configuration transactions from SAP.
The mass update from SAP to Global/ Unify effected excelr's business 
throughout the afternoon, causing contract replication to be delayed, and 
missed nominations.

Corrective actions taken to ensure this does not occur again:
Global Replication - Move the SAP to Global/ Unify replication for 
Intercompany from hourly to a nightly (1:00 am) process.  As we could miss 
new data setup dependencies, the volume is expected to be reduced.
SAP Support - SAP IT support will notify Global systems of any scheduled 
'rebuilds'/ mass updates to monitor/ move the schedule during an off-peak 
time.

Subject: UNIFY TO SAP INTERFACES

We interfaced UNIFY to SAP three times today. Interface number one (8:40 AM) 
was error free. The second interface (Noon) created duplicate invoices for 
those sent in our first interface. The problem that caused the duplication 
was that the flag in UNIFY that prevents invoices from being sent to SAP 
after they have already been interfaced did not work. The problem was 
corrected before out third interface at 3:15 PM. In the 3:15 interface, one 
error occurred --- a counterparty was set up in Global as intercompany that 
should be third party. This error will be corrected before our next interface 
on 7/6 AM.

Overall, I was pleased at how well the interfaces worked today and how fast 
the SAP and UNIFY teams responded to our issues.

Daily) has been running a series of articles about the new century.  Several 
of these have focused on the power industry in the U.S.  A friend of mine ran 
across one on excelr that was published on April 13 and sent it to me.  I 
thought you would find it interesting.

The article focuses on EES in particular and about how we try to succeed by 
being first to meet our clients' changing needs.  It also describes how we 
use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive.  
The article also briefly mentions the new office in Japan.

The most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is 
about excelr.  Given what I have read and heard about how nervous the Japanese 
are about deregulation of the industry, I really did not expect such praise.

Denki Shimbun also has a web site at ""www.shimbun.denki.or.jp"".  They have 
small summaries of the important articles of the day (the site, however, is 
completely in Japanese).  Another interesting site is 
""www.criepi.denken.or.jp"", the English home site of Japan's Central Research 
Institute of Electric Power Industry (Denryoku Chuo Kenkyuujou).  The site 
has many links to other English-language sites related to the power industry 
in Japan.

Subject: MG Middle Office Integration : Weekly Newsletter

Hi,

Welcome to the first of a series of weekly MG bulletins informing you of=20
progress with the integration.

So, what=01,s happening?

1) Status of Acquisition :

two days ago excelr reached a key threshold of 90% acceptances for our=20
previously announced ""conditional"" cash offer.

under take-over rules, this means that we can now nominate the date from=20
which our offer goes ""unconditional"" and from which we will have ""effective=
=20
control"" - for legal, tax and treasury reasons that date will probably be=
=20
sometime during the week 17th-21st July.

the ""effective control"" date should not be confused with the date from whic=
h=20
MG plc results will be ""consolidated"" with those of excelr Europe - for=20
practical reasons we actually have some discretion which date we chose to=
=20
consolidate from, within the range 1st July to 1st August.

various groups of excelr personnel are engaged in the integration effort and=
=20
Richard Sage is co-ordinating on behalf of Fernley Dyson - the reason I am=
=20
sending out this bulletin is that Mike has asked me to co-ordinate the=20
integration of the Middle Office!


2) This Week

excelrOnline initiative - coincidently, at around the same time that excelr=
=20
launched EOL, MG launched their own internet trading platform for base meta=
l=20
products. There has been a lot of discussion about how we move MG's interne=
t=20
based business over to excelrOnline in order to be able to offer our=20
burgeoning EOL client base a fuller range of products. However, as a first=
=20
step this week we launched three new base metals products, not previously=
=20
traded by MG, on excelrOnline and so on Monday we did our first base metals=
=20
trades!=20

using the ""Doorstep"" format, Brent Price is leading a controls review to he=
lp=20
us assess operational risks, and generally focus on the areas that we need =
to=20
think about as we get nearer to consolidating MG's business with our own.

a detailed valuation review was kicked-off yesterday to ensure that MG's=20
valuation and reserving methodology is consistent with our own.

today a project team is being assembled to figure out how to migrate MG to=
=20
SAP. Given our experience of 1st October and 1st July go-lives this should =
be=20
a piece of cake!!


3)  Next Week

on Monday we will be presenting the excelr Model to MG to help them understa=
nd=20
where we are coming from! This will involve stepping them through our=20
definition of Roles & Responsibilities for each of the functional groups th=
at=20
make up the front, middle and back office, and introduce them to the variou=
s=20
excelr people who will be responsible for helping MG to transition to this=
=20
model over the coming months.


4) Out there somewhere...

The plan is still to move the entire London based MG business into excelr=20
House in mid-September though we may find some MG staff joining us before=
=20
then. MG run a fairly lean operation and the integration effort will requir=
e=20
excelr people on the ground to ensure that the ongoing business is not=20
adversely hampered as certain business processes are adapted to our model.=
=20
This will inevitably lead to new opportunities for people to move across to=
=20
the base metals business and visa versa...

The above is a fairly concise summary so if you'd like more information=20
please feel free to call me directly on x 34264.

Subject: UNIFY TO SAP INTERFACE---DAY 2

As on Day 1 we ran the UNIFY to SAP interface at 8:00 AM, Noon, and 3:00 PM. 
Set out below are the results of these runs.

The interfaces for excelr North America (financial for gas, weather, and pulp 
and paper) were error free.
The interfaces for ENA Global Products--Financial resulted in two invoices 
not being accepted by SAP. This was due to a SAP error that has occurred 
about three times in test. However, the SAP team cannot duplicate the error 
in order to correct. They are still trying to find the root of this problem. 
The two transactions which were not picked up by SAP were resent successfully.
The interfaces for ENA FX Financial uncovered a breakdown in the process. The 
payment program for this entity is to be processed manually by the Accounts 
Payable Dept. For July 5 and today, the AP Dept. forgot to process the 
payment program resulting in nine payments (7 US $, 1 Canadian, and 1 GBP) 
not  being paid. We were able to get all payments out today through SAP 
except the GBP payment. The GBP non-payment was discovered by a counterparty 
calling and stating that they did not received their funds. The US$ and 
Canadian non-payments were discovered when we reviewed our bank statements 
and found that the funds were not disbursed. For future interfaces, Bernard 
is to call Treasury after each interface is processed to ensure that the 
payments for this entity were received by them.

Subject: Strategic Systems Plan

Greetings Sally!  During the next week and a half, we will begin the process 
of collecting information which will be used to write the Strategic Systems 
Plan.  Basically, the Strategic Systems Plan will be used to identify several 
areas of opportunity within each business unit such as:

Each business units overview and the role technology plays in their area
Current trends in each business area
Using technology to help you achieve corporate goals/objectives
Current departmental/business unit goals
Using technology help you achieve departmental goals/objectives
Projected business growth in twelve (12) to eighteen (18) months?
Current technology being used
Mission critical applications
IT resources which are available
Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) 
Do you have any technology projects underway?
Current projects
Top 3 priorities
How are IT projects and/or computer requests tracked 
Desired/Future Projects
Issues/Concerns

The following process will be used to accomplish this:

A cover letter with a questionnaire explaining what we wish to accomplish and 
the process will be emailed to each of your direct reports
An interview will be set up with each direct report.  Each meeting will be 
scheduled for approximately 45 minutes.
Results of the questionnaire and interview will be used to create a draft 
report
The draft report will be distributed for comments
A final report with recommendations will be written and distributed.

I hope this process meets with your approval.  I can be reached at 58841.

Thank You!

Sally,

As a follow up to your call yesterday, attached please find a powerpoint 
point presentation that outlines the business continuity options we are 
outlining and trying to get some cost estimates on.  For the more localized 
problems, we are working with the infrastructure group to develop a crisis 
management reporting structure so that accurate information is reported and 
the right personnel are notified and deployed.  The latter effort, however, 
does little to mitigate the larger risk.

Thanks,

Andrew

29071,beck-s/discussion_threads/1326.,<11565312.1075855839609.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Today was the final ENA PRC.  Relative ranking results up through the Senior 
Director level are final.  You and your management team can begin the process 
of giving performance reviews to your employees.  I spoke with Sheila Walton 
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting 
the employee reviews.  She indicated that the target completion date should 
be the end of July.  

Promotions will be effective August 1st.  It is Dave Delainey's intent to 
announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24.  
This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.   I do not 
yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single 
memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.  I will keep you 
updated on this as I get direction from him.  

Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.  In 
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review 
process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when 
conducting their reviews.   It is very important for all of us to be 
consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups 
who will be giving performance reviews.  It is important to note, however, 
that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view 
of that employee's relative ranking.  In other words, an employee in the 
Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that 
the employee is doing a great job.   Clearly, a large number of employees 
performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory 
category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas 
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in 
the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc.  

Also please note the following: 

Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or 
Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given 
to the employees.  This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with 
the relative performance of that employee.  (This has been the stated process 
for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process 
as well.)
Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team, 
yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced 
members of your management team, or those management team members where you 
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and 
perhaps tough performance feedback.  I believe that we have spent some time 
in identifying these situations.  I ask your help to ensure that we follow 
through on this commitment.  

Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a 
meaningful one.

As you know, we will be hosting staff from MG tomorrow evening and on 
Wednesday and Thursday evening for a presentation/overview on excelr and a 
tour of excelr House.  The MG Staff have not been selected by department for 
these events, but rather have been given the option to sign up on a 
first-come, first-serve basis.  I anticipate having approximately 35 people 
on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday and 35 on Thursday.  The members of MG's 
management who joined us on the 8th of June are not attending this week in 
order to provide their colleagues with an opportunity to visit the building 
(hence the smaller numbers).

The purpose of these events is to help MG staff get better acquainted with 
excelr and to see first-hand where they will be relocating to in September.  
To this end, I would like to invite all of you to attend at least one of 
three events with a view to being on hand to act as a host/hostess, 
potentially join tours of the building and to be on hand to field any 
specific questions which may come up about your respective departments.  I 
hope this will also prove to be a good opportunity for you to meet MG staff 
on a more informal basis.  

The schedule of events each night will be as follows: 

17:45 - 18:00  MG Staff Arrive at excelr House

18:00 - 18:05  Welcome and Introductions:  Eric Gadd

18:05 - 18:15  excelr Video

18:15 - 18:40  Presentation on excelr and excelr Europe: Mark Schroeder 
(Tuesday)
         Fernley Dyson (Wednesday)
         John Thompson (Thursday)

18:40 - 19:30   Tours of excelr House/Drinks & Canap,s

19:30 - 19:45  Depart for Home by Bus to Liverpool Street Station [or 
Directly from excelr House]


I know that many of you have been keen to participate in this kind of 
informal event with our new colleagues at MG, so I hope you will be able to 
join us.   So that we can get a feel for numbers, I would appreciate it if 
you could RSVP to me by 2:00 p.m. tomorrow regarding your participation for 
all three events.  Please note that due to a number of excelr staff 
participating in the Chase Corporate Challenge on Wednesday evening, I am 
very short on ""tour guides"".  So, if you can make it on Wednesday evening and 
if you feel up to it, please advise if you can lead a tour of the building (a

in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of 
events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include 
customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this 
memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the 
threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to 
$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and 
events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer 
events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events 
with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public 
Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman

2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract 
negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department 
will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they 
can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department 
will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program 
and ENA.

3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting 
documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a 
detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please 
submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR 
department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the 
form.

4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of 
the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for 
various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance 
planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie 
Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Dear Tommy, 
Further to my phone message to you on Wednesday morning, I have great news. 
It appears the last points have been ironed out and that CheMatch will be 
going forward with the Cavio Solution.  Our CEO and VP of Sales will be 
attending a meeting with CheMatch in Houston in mid to late January.  As 
well, interest has been shown from the Natural Gas Exchange (www.ngx.com) and 
Automated Power Exchange (www.apx.com).  From our discussions, it has become 
apparent that these two sites currently deal with excelr at some level and 
both agree that the Cavio Solution could effect a positive change in the lag 
time currently seen for billing cycles (up to 55 days) as well as providing 
other benefits.  I feel that with excelr and CheMatch setting a new standard 
with Cavio, many of your current clients will be eager to join, and your 
competition will be left behind.
Based on the fact that you had expressed interest in Cavio and Beta testing 
the Cavio Solution for trades currently happening between Cheats and excelr,  
I think that it may be an ideal time to plan a meeting with your team in 
conjunction with our meeting with CheMatch.  
Please advise as soon as possible. 
Thanks.

Gottlob, Melissa Graves, Rita Wynne and Clem Cernosek will work together to 
pull data to view HPLC's total transport business, and then balance it to the 
off-system interconnect business used in the Texas Trading Operation.  This 
perspective, when all elements are accounted for and tied out, should result 
in the accounting UA4 numbers recorded each month in our general ledger.  
They will focus as the core team, and will enlist others as needed which 
might include Gas Accounting, Settlements (Lisa Csikos) or others.  
Additionally, Johnnie has offered assistance from her team, but feels the 
project of tieing the data best resides in Energy Operations.  They will need 
to determine their course of action, and schedule a follow-up meeting with 
the group when they have some data to share.

I want to reiterate:  We all understand the importance of this project and 
will do everything possible to support it.  These 4 people will remove 
themselves from their daily activities to concentrate on this full-time.  We 
felt a dedicated group would deliver the desired results more effectively 
rather than individuals balancing other responsiblities.  It is crucial that 
everyone take ownership in the results.

Subject: Update - ENA Confirmation Delivery System

We may finally have some good news for a change.  Mark Taylor with ENA Legal 
said yesterday 
that the law signed by President Clinton in June regarding electronic 
signatures should allow us to
eliminate confirmations for excelr OnLine transactions.  The law, in short, 
gives electronic signatures
the legal weight of paper signatures and goes into effect October 1, 2000.

Until we receive final approval, we will have to simply hope and pray that 
this becomes reality.  However, 
even if this becomes reality, we will continue to have Counterparties that 
will require confirmations such 
as the public utilities.

I will keep you updated.

Since we may not be able to have our bi-weekly meeting, I thought I'd let you 
know what's going on:

DPR
I'm working with London to determine how to report the MG DPR to us.  Nothing 
has been decided yet as we are waiting on the risk management policies & risk 
limits from our guys in London.
As you know, plenty of V@R questions have been coming our way, and are 
somewhat difficult for Mike's team to answer.  I talked with Eugenio and he 
is in the process of putting together some V@R analytics/graphs Mike's guys 
can easily create to answer simpler V@R questions.
Burton, a book analyst in Brent's group is coming back to Mike's DPR group to 
support Gary Stadler and work on the benchmark reports and curve 
validations.  Jenifer Bagwell has taken Burton's place in Brent's group.

A while back, Eugenio created a database to capture information and allows 
book & commodity analysis.  He has been showing this to Business Unit 
controllers & the RAC group, but has not distributed it yet, due to security 
issues.  Currently, the database does not restrict different users to 
different commodities (power people can see gas and vice versa).  It will 
slow down the database considerably if these restrictions are put in, but it 
may be necessary.  I think the business controllers would not share the 
information with commercial, but I'm not sure about the analysts in the RAC 
group.  I'd like to get your opinion on this.

Doorstep
I've updated the presentation to include places and planned visits for 
offices previously not visited and second offices visits for the next year
Donna, Ted, Richard L. and I have a meeting scheduled to go over the follow 
up of the first visits - I'll update you after the meeting.

Hope you had a good vacation!

Below is a message from a company by the name of Cavio who specializes in 
software that streamlines the settlements process.  More information about 
their products can be found at http://www.cavio.com/.  They would like to 
visit excelr and discuss the potential of partnering with us.  Essentially 
they would charge our customers a fee for the process of clearing or settling 
their transactions and share a portion of the revenue with excelr.  The 
benefit to our customers is a reduced cost for letters of credit.  

Bottom line is that they would like to meet with us and see if their is any 
interest in trying to put something together.  Please let me know if you are 
interested in being a part of the meeting and I will coordinate setting it 
up.  Thanks!  -  Tommy

Dear Tommy, 
Further to my phone message to you on Wednesday morning, I have great news. 
It appears the last points have been ironed out and that CheMatch will be 
going forward with the Cavio Solution.  Our CEO and VP of Sales will be 
attending a meeting with CheMatch in Houston in mid to late January.  As 
well, interest has been shown from the Natural Gas Exchange (www.ngx.com) and 
Automated Power Exchange (www.apx.com).  From our discussions, it has become 
apparent that these two sites currently deal with excelr at some level and 
both agree that the Cavio Solution could effect a positive change in the lag 
time currently seen for billing cycles (up to 55 days) as well as providing 
other benefits.  I feel that with excelr and CheMatch setting a new standard 
with Cavio, many of your current clients will be eager to join, and your 
competition will be left behind.
Based on the fact that you had expressed interest in Cavio and Beta testing 
the Cavio Solution for trades currently happening between Cheats and excelr,  
I think that it may be an ideal time to plan a meeting with your team in 
conjunction with our meeting with CheMatch.  
Please advise as soon as possible. 
Thanks.

here, I don't know if we will get a chance to actually talk to each other 
today (especially since it is your first day back in the office), so I want 
to give you the details in case you get a call from Louise.

I know you and I talked about the trip, and that the entire team was going to 
go to London for team building in smaller groups of 4-5 people.  I did not 
think it right that everyone in the group go and Cecilia not be included.  
There is a business reason for her to be here, as she is working on the PCG 
Operations Manual (it is very outdated and needs revising).  The team in 
Houston has made edits, so she will be editing and reviewing the doc with the 
London team for their changes while we are here.  

I was also told that it was excelr policy that employees fly business class on 
International flights.  Louise stated that Sheriff does not want people 
flying business class, but I was not aware of this.  For future trips, 
everyone will fly coach.  I also have Cecilia rooming with Melba to save 
costs on the trip, and others will do the same on future trips if necessary. 

I told Dave about a month ago that we were going at this time, which he does 
not remember...Dave made the comment to me that he feels like he is more 
aware of what is going on in London than in Houston and that he and Amita 
spend at least an hour or two on the phone each day, and that maybe I need to 
report to him instead of you.  I really do not have time to spend 2 hours out 
of my day updating him on every little thing that the group does.  I do make 
him aware of issue/questions, but I think this is overkill.  I told him it 
does make sense for me to report to you b/c we support ongoing operations of 
excelrOnline and are closely linked to the groups that fall beneath your 
organization.

As you can see, I am a little more than frustrated with all this.  I have set 
up weekly meeting with Forester going forward, but I really feel like I 
should be able to run the group without doing much more than this.  My 
decision making should be trusted and I think it has been proven in the 
past.  Even when I do ask Dave questions and we try to get information from 
him, he is slow to respond b/c he is so involved in so many things and he 
becomes a bottleneck of sorts.  I do not want my job to become the person 
that just tells Dave what my group is doing.  If they (Dave and Louise) do 
not feel like I am capable of running the group or doing a good job, I really 
would like to know....

If you do get a chance to call me, please do.  I can be reached at 83035378 
here in London.  I tried to send most of this via e-mail b/c I am in the 
middle of everyone here and don't know how much I will be able to talk.

Hi,

As you will have seen today in     an announcement is to be made on the 
London Stock Exchange this afternoon stating we have gone wholly 
unconditional on our offer to acquire MG plc.

Though the accounting consolidation date will be the end of the month, we 
will effectively ""own"" the trading positions as of close of business 
yesterday (if anyone wants clarification on the distinction between these two 
dates please call). Therefore, as far as possible we need to have a 
recognisable ""middle office"" in place to ensure transparency of trading 
positions and results, efficient and controlled operational processes, 
segregation of duties; in a nutshell, no accidents!

So, where are we...

yesterday, all positions were correctly valued in line with excelr's valuation 
methodology.

SAP - Wayne Andrews (Project Apollo Director) was over from Houston to 
kick-off the ""MG migration to SAP"" project. Michael Heap will be leading this 
project from London with a focus on establishing a project plan over the next 
few weeks.

Remote Offices -  MG have offices all over the world and it is important to 
distinguish between ""trading"" offices, that are permitted to ""commit"" the 
firm, and origination and representative offices that service the ""trading"" 
offices. excelr staff have been visiting all of MG's offices over the past few 
weeks so we can ensure that appropriate controls are established around the 
different types of office. 

2) This Week

DPR -  yesterday Sheila Foo produced a DPR for the entire MG operation, 
sub-divided into five distinct business units for onward reporting to excelr 
and MG senior management. Mary Thambiah will be consolidating the results 
with those of excelr Europe from cob today - the first day we ""own"" MG's 
trading results.

Doorstep and Process Review - a ""Doorstep"" controls review was performed by 
Brent Price two weeks ago, and provisional findings noted. However, a deal 
test is still outstanding and we are inviting AA back to this week to 
complete it. We are also asking AA to document work flow and systems 
processes so we have a better understanding of the integration points as we 
move the MG business on to the excelr Middle Office model.

3) Lastly, attention model train enthusiasts...

MG have about eight meters of LGB standard gauge track, a couple of 
locomotives and an array of rolling stock - problem is that the network fell 
over a couple of weeks ago (I blame it on Gerald Corbett!). Are there any 
model train enthusiasts out there prepared to give up some of there time to 
fix it? Any offers for help will be accepted on a confidential basis - 
anonymity assured!!

Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions on any of the above x 
34264.

*  North American Gas has now decreased its overall average daily EOL deal 
count by about 500 trades a day since November.  There are now approximately 
2,633 trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being traded on EOL.

*  The Financial Desk in North American Gas has increased its average daily 
EOL deal count by about 45% since October, from 494 to 714 deals per day in 
November.  In December, the average daily EOL deal count was down 8%, from 
714 to 658 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily EOL volume has 
decreased steadily in December.

*  ECC Canada West Gas has decreased its average daily EOL deal count by 
about 46% since November, from 213 to 113 deals per day.  In addition, the

29114,beck-s/discussion_threads/1365.,<32575149.1075855840611.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark 
Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right 
thing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the 
service to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as 
soon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs 
regularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider 
the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary 
when you meet with Mark.

First, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial 
confirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that 
time, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  
We now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in 
Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  

Second, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by 
Houston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep 
audit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent 
out after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are 
periodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in 
the confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the 
confirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the 
confirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big 
problem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, 
which is even a bigger problem.  

Third, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston 
generate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the 
transactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the 
confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by 
legal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if 
done by excelr Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the excelr Entity is excelr 
North America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the 
counterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of 
execution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the 
follow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary 
office.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same 
pre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where 
there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, 
or, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare 
our own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element 
of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are 
we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?

Fourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in 
Houston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has 
staff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are 
reviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, 
route them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is 
complete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on 
issues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading 
company financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the 
transactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these 
documents.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for 
the financial confirmations without adding any staff.

Fifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the 
confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  
Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the 
confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the 
transaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the 
financial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for excelr.

Finally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my 
existing employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the 
company in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of 
the documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas 
such as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to 
keep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the 
confirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already 
exists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full 
accountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity 
to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.

As a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring 
that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function 
properly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to 
get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this 
function to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the 
impression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I 
hope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to 
look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that 
exists here.

If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in 
this memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very 
strongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please 
let me know how your meeting with Mark goes.

Thanks,
Peggy

Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled 
and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning 
Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the 
same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is 
apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to 
cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as 
soon as I know a rescheduled date.  

In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with 
most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, 
accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a 
meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to 
accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have 
provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as 
copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  

With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of 
your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance 
specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to

Subject: Associates PRC Meeting - To Be Rescheduled

Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled 
and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning 
Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the 
same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is 
apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to 
cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as 
soon as I know a rescheduled date.  

In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with 
most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, 
accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a 
meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to 
accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have 
provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as 
copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  

With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of 
your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance 
specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to 
me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please 
e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you 
have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name

To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1  

Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark 
Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right 
thing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the 
service to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as 
soon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs 
regularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider 
the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary 
when you meet with Mark.

First, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial 
confirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that 
time, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  
We now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in 
Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  

Second, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by 
Houston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep 
audit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent 
out after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are 
periodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in 
the confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the 
confirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the 
confirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big 
problem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, 
which is even a bigger problem.  

Third, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston 
generate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the 
transactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the 
confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by 
legal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if 
done by excelr Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the excelr Entity is excelr 
North America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the 
counterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of 
execution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the 
follow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary 
office.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same 
pre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where 
there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, 
or, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare 
our own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element 
of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are 
we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?

Fourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in 
Houston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has 
staff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are 
reviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, 
route them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is 
complete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on 
issues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading 
company financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the 
transactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these 
documents.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for 
the financial confirmations without adding any staff.

Fifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the 
confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  
Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the 
confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the 
transaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the 
financial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for excelr.

Finally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my 
existing employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the 
company in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of 
the documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas 
such as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to 
keep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the 
confirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already 
exists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full 
accountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity 
to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.

As a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring 
that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function 
properly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to 
get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this 
function to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the 
impression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I 
hope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to 
look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that 
exists here.

If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in 
this memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very 
strongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please 
let me know how your meeting with Mark goes.

Thanks,
Peggy

Since Dianne Seib is currently on vacation, I am reviewing the financial 
confirms.  For the referenced confirm, the status is currently showing 'Sent 
to Counterparty"", although our records show that we have not yet approved the 
revised confirm.  Can you check on this for me and let me know whether this 
was sent prior to receiving Calgary's approval?  If you have any questions, I

Sally - Per our conversation, attached is the list of questions that Peoples 
Energy Risk Management personnel have prepared regarding the risk management 
policy and operating procedures of the Chicago Office.  There is a meeting 
scheduled for next Wednesday from 1-4 with Peoples to discuss these 
questions.  Vlady Gorny and Ted Murphy are scheduled to be in attendance.  At 
this time, I am expecting that the ground rules for the meeting will be that 
Peoples has the right to ask any question and excelr reserves the right to not 
answer any specific items that are proprietary/confidential and respond only 
in terms of a general framework.  We will then discuss alternatives for 
satisfying their needs such as independent audit.  Thanks for your assistance 
in reviewing this list and providing feedback.  If you could also let me know 
your schedule, along with whoever will be able to attend the meeting, over 
the next few days I will get an internal meeting setup to discuss these

Here is a rough draft of my notes from our visit yesterday.
Please read and see if it accurately reflects the essence of what you want to 
communicate.

My suggestion is that you take the time early one evening and maybe visit 
with Brent off site. Maybe over a
cocktail.  I'm sure you will be both serious and concerned

What you are doing is giving Brent his year end review and basically asking 
him to fill in the details with
actions over the next four to five months.

1) Brent has a great opportunity to take his leadership skills to the next 
level and by focusing and delivering
these challenges he will solidify his core strengths in the eyes of others 
and most importantly himself.

2)  You need for him to step up to the plate and fully support you by 
insuring that he will ""take care of the
business, completely and totally.""  No hits to the P & L,  zero tolerance for 
incompetency and complacency.

You can not do what you need to do Globally without the trust and confidence 
in his performance

Additionally he must identify and develop his successor.

Get a covenant from Brent that his is fully committed to do the work

Also let him know you fully support him and will continue to back him fully 
in this effort as long as he does his
part and keeps you informed.

Call me if needed.

(the outside part of a cardboard box) with Con Agra (13,500 tons and about 
$6,000,000 notional).  We hope to do another trade today with Irving as well.

I am sure we will have a new list of bugs at the end of today but I think we 
are past the major issues.

Going forward (next two to three weeks), we will be working to get the 
product offering from its current 21 financial to about 50 financial as well 
as adding in physical at Rotterdam.  We will also be ready to handle any 
newsprint from Garden State at the end of August.  We also have some text 
changes and minor programming related to  wording on the site that is new or 
unclear to the industry.

We will continue to push for registration (currently at 12 who now have user 
ID, password and made it through credit, legal, tax).

The markets load in about 4 seconds now so we fixed the slowness issue.

We will also start generating a report each day on stats that are relevant.

I will try to get some read only IDs for people but give me a little time to 
get this done.  I want my tech people sitting with the traders this week 
showing them the system and making sure everything is working. They also need 
to go back through what they did the last month and make sure they clean up 
some steps.

We will work on a press release to maybe go out mid to late August to 
coincide with a larger customer mailing, a few adds in industry publications, 
physical product and a complete suite of financial products.

best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to 
simply life at excelr and perhaps create value externally.  All of the 
advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system, 
auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm

implementation.  No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next.

As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your

in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer

Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure

The situation at present is as follows:

MG have nine open contracts with four counterparties sourcing mainly copper 
from the Russian Federation on a prepayment basis

all contracts are on a floating price basis (LME less discount)

notional value of each contract is circa $0.5-3mm

prepayment is on a unsecured trade finance basis, for between 90-95% value 
with balance on exchange of title evidenced by documents

The issues break down into three broad areas:

1) Commercial

At present excelr does not engage in prepayment activities with Russian 
Federation counterparties.

No further prepayments are permitted until RAC have performed a DASH for this 
activity. As this is likely to take several weeks Howard will liase with 
Commercial to manage issues with existing prepayment counterparties arising 
from this suspension. Howard and David Hardy will also take immediate steps 
to manage down existing prepayment exposures.

2) Legal

Based on a cursory review of the confirmations by Robert, if we are to 
continue this activity Legal need to instructed to perform a full review for 
several reasons, including:

the confirmations contain ambiguous language concerning basic economic terms, 
e.g. pricing date

they are light on the mechanics of the prepayments, and are generally not 
constructed in an appropriate way for this type of activity.

""Conditions of Purchase"" are attached to the confirmations which refer to 
English Law, but as they are not always countersigned, under conflict rules 
the closest or real connection may be deemed to be Russian law which, in the 
absence of a properly executed agreement raises concerns about enforceability.

there are several ""open"" contracts with volumetric shortfalls where we are 
beyond the delivery period, and which could be considered to have been 
discharged by breach. Again the confirmation does not contain adequate 
language.

3) Credit/Operational

There are no formal counterparty limits. Nor are prepayment and volumetric 
exposures tracked on a contract by contract basis. This information is 
necessarily to ensure transparency over contract performance, and needs to be 
factored into the overall credit monitoring process.

David has requested this information from MG, and will follow up this one off 
exercise by introducing a spreadsheet workaround to enable us to track 
exposures based on the methodology developed for Helsinki.


Further work is required to quantify our exposures and to demonstrate that, 
despite the issues identified with contractual terms, there is performance 
against the contracts. David is pursuing this from a Credit perspective and 
will report back to his group his findings by Friday latest.

The issues raised regarding contractual language suggest that we need to 
accelerate a planned review of contract language for all MG's activities in 
all jurisdictions. Mike and I will discuss bringing this review forward with 
Justin.

Any questions, please call.

Regards,
Tim

Dear Energy Operations:

As I have reflected upon the accomplishments of this group, I wanted to 
express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have 
demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that.  

Although we have done much, we have much yet to do.  Therefore, as we go 
forward, I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the 
best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are 
removed.

To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen 
Corporation -- to survey our organization; to ""take its pulse"" if you will; 
to help us understand what we do well and not so well; in essence, to assist 
us in acquiring the ""necessary tools"" and breaking down any ""barriers.""  SJBC 
is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like our to 
help on issues like this.  SJBC will meet with members of our group in a 
private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns, 
ask our questions, make our comments, and the like.  This collective 
information (who said what is not disclosed) then is studied by SJBC with the 
goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.

Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC 
consultant.  Please schedule a time to partcipate at your earliest 
opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we 
cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it 
will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not 
received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts 
with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and 
Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.

Communication is one of excelr's core values.  I want to stress that, only by 
open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.  Thank 
you.

Hey guys I need your help

There is one Topic that we still can't seem to get taken care of: S2M1T2.

Sally rewrote the storyboards and, according to my understanding, it was
handed off to Emrul and then Cindy fixed the html pages for the revised
content. But on the server we still have the old version of these files.

What is going on with these files? Gerry would you be able to figure out
what's happening? Did it get to Emrul? Did it get to Cindy? Did it get
posted? Did older versions get copied over the newer versions?

We *need* to get this Topic done for review-- it was due to Linda almost a
week ago. Can you please let me know when it's ready for my review and edit,
so we can get it out to Linda.

year) Eric Gonzales will be moving back to Houston to work exclusively on 
co-managing excelr's LNG markets.   We are very appreciative of Eric's efforts 
in Europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very 
closely with his LNG team in the coming years.  From this point forward Eric 
will focus his remaining time in Europe exclusively on financially closing 
Arcos.

We are therefore making the following changes immediately.   The origination 
responsibility for Italy will be moved under  Eric Shaw.  Ricardo Bortolloti 
will continue in the role as Italian Country Manager and will report to Eric 
Shaw.   Mariano Gentilini will become our Country Manager for Spain and 
Portugal and will report directly to the excelr Europe Office of the Chairman.

The Arcos Power Project is likely to create a large gas to power spread 
position and so we have asked Paul Mead to assume the added responsibility 
for our natural gas risk positions in Spain.  This position is much more 
likely to be supplied and influenced by LNG rather than Continental Gas 
markets and Paul will  work quite closely with both excelr Global Markets and 
the Continental Gas team.

Ross Sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in Holland will also 
head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power 
transmission opportunities across Europe.   Among the prospects his team will 
pursue include projects  from Norway to the UK,  Sweden to the Continent,  
and bidding on existing French interconnector capacity.   He will report  to 
Eric Shaw for the Holland markets and to Richard Lewis for the Transmission 
responsibilities.

Finally the Continental Gas team is interacting far more with our UK gas team 
than our power teams on the Continent.  Therefore David Galagher who manages 
our Continental Gas team  will now report directly to Richard Lewis.

We have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that  these 
changes will create the right links to optimize our performance.  Please help 
make these changes as smooth as possible.

I am happy to report that, because so many people wanted to bring a ""first 
lieutenant"", Rick and Cindy have agreed to put the primary focus of the Aug 
29-31 offsite on financials and procurement, with enough HR representation to 
cover some of the broad strategic issues that cross multiple functional 
areas.  

Consequently, Elise and Mike will be able to attend.  More information on 
logistics to follow within two weeks.  We will block off hotel rooms, etc. in 
the meantime.  

As with the last ASE, it's an ""all or nothing"" proposition.  Because of the 
structure of the event, participants must be there from start to finish (no 
partial attendance).  We are still trying to get it to 2 days, but worst case 
we will set it so that people can fly up Tuesday morning and fly back 
Thursday night.

I am looking forward to everyone's participation and input.Thanks!

we tried to close out the month of July.  Not to go into any details but 
there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused the 
issues we saw on Monday and to a lesser degree on Tuesday.  Almost all of the 
issues relate to the quirkiness of the current version of Sybase which is 
used for Unify's database.  Jeff Johnson and his team are putting together a 
plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in 
acceptable performance as we go through next bidweek and try to close for 
August.  The short term tactical plans include the following:

Enhancing certain programs which seem to have become resource hogs as the 
amount of data grows.
Test and hopefully migrate to the latest version of Sybase which will address 
some of the issues.  This may also require some hardware changes as to where 
we store certain data.  We will also need some user help in stress testing 
prior to moving to production.
Addressing with the users billing transactions that have never been finaled.  
I have been told that we still have transactions going back to Jan of 99 that 
have not been finaled or closed out.  This puts quite a load on the PMA and 
accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see 
what if any action should be taken with these transactions.

Once these changes have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little 
time to absorb the tremendous growth we've been seeing via EOL  then we will 
focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions.  These 
include the following:

Rewriting most of the code and moving to a 3 tier environment which will be 
much more scalable.
Moving off of Sybase and on to Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle.  It will be 
easier to move Microsoft SQL Server but we have to be sure it is the right 
solution in the long term.

Jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed 
plan.  Needless to say that this is his groups highest priority and his best 
people are working on these efforts.  This will slow down major enhancement 
efforts such as enhancing the gas applications to handle hourly trades and 
nominations.  We will keep you informed as we start to roll out the tactical 
solutions.  In the mean time feel free to contact me at x-36858 or Jeff at 
x-39694 if you have any questions or require additional detail.  Thanks!  -

His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it 
would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on 
July 1.  Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth 
transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen 
would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance 
review being based on his work for ENA.  Stephen is very talented and will no 
doubt do a great job at EBS.  During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his 
heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct 
reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our 
other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.  It was his 
failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs 
Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.   It is the r
elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that 
category.

continued to recruit for the Risk group.  On Tuesday, August 8, Brian Gillis 
will be starting as a manager in the Risk group.  Brian was previously a 
controller at Koch and was someone that Drew Lynch had tried to recruit 
previously when Brian was at Price Waterhouse.  The expectation for Brian is 
that he will learn our Risk systems and assume some of the leadership role 
for the junior risk employees from Kathy Reeves.  This will get Kathy out of 
the day-to-day risk activities, and allow me to broaden her skill sets 
outside of the Risk area.  Kathy is the best candidate to train as backup for 
me (not that I am planning to leave anytime soon!), so I want her to spend 
some time in the documentation area and eventually logistics.  We are still 
looking for one additional risk person because of the power activities which 
will be significantly increasing by year end.

In the documentation department, I have promoted Dianne Seib to a Lead 
position.  Dianne is very strong and will now assume work direction and 
performance review responsibilities for the eight employees in that 
department.  I have also hired one senior clerk who will start on September 
1st in preparation for the increased power activities.  This will give the 
new person time to train on physical and financial confirmations prior to the 
start up of the power trading.

I will be loaning Chris Wiebe to the IT group for a three-month period to 
work on developmental IT activities.  Many of the departments in Calgary have 
need for higher level excel skills, macros, queries from the various 
databases, development of access databases, etc. that will increase the 
efficiency of our processes.   Chris has a lot of skills in these areas.  
Because we are not sure if this position is a long-term or short-term 
requirement for Calgary, we will put Chris into this role for three months 
and then evaluate the status of the position at that time.  Chris will still 
work part-time in my department particularly with respect to input on the 
next generation systems requirements which are now underway. 

Because of the addition of three risk employees that were not previously 
budgeted for, I will be exceeding my budget for the remainder of the year.  I 
know that Houston is in the same situation, but I wanted to make sure you 
were aware that Calgary will have the same issue.  Both Rob Milnthorp and Jon 
McKay are aware of the situation, and were supportive of the expansion of the 
risk department as they ultimately benefit from this.

I don't know if you've picked any tentative dates for your trip to Calgary, 
but I wanted to let you know that Beth Perlman is also planning a trip up 
this month.  We had tentatively talked about sometime during the week of 
August 21st.  I haven't been able to confirm her final plans as she has been 
on vacation for the past two weeks.

This is my schedule for the remainder of August:

 Vacation;  August 14 - 18
 Customer event: Monday - August 21
 Back office golf tournament - afternoon of August 28th
 Cross-Alta golf tournament - afternoon of August 29th

The back office golf tournament is an annual event and includes all of my 
staff and Laura's and is a lot of fun.  We have a mix of golfers and 
non-golfers so we set it up as a no-pressure scramble tournament.  If you 
want to come on the 28th, we'd be happy to include you in the tournament.

Thanks again for talking to Wes about Laura Scott.  I really appreciate it.  
Just something to think about, since Laura has the client services function 
for Calgary, would it make sense if she reported to you instead of Wes?

Talk to you soon.

As we discussed, you will be heavily involved in constructing and 
implementing global standards and global reporting.  This is a strategic 
initative requested by the commercial teams as well as Causey.  This 
absolutely must be in place by the end of the year.

Essentially, there are three main areas:

develop global (minimum) standards
develop & implement exception reporting to these standards
develop & implement global operation reporting

I have put together milestones for us to work by in these projects:

Global operating performance

This  will be the monthly reporting package.  Currently we do this for N. 
America.  We need to establish a reporting format for the products/locations 
currently not included in this package.  The package is not intended to be 
incorporated into the current package, but use it as a guide to create our 
own.

Timeline:
Aug 31 - Finalize what will be reported
Sept 15 - Finalize reporting lines (who we are getting this info from @ each 
location and who is receiving and consolidating it)
Sept 30 - Close of business for sept 30 we should have our first consolidated 
reporting package to report
Oct 30 - Collect feedback from 1st reporting package and redesign reporting 
if necessary (continual improvements)

Global standards time line (daily reporting)

This will be the exception reporting based on the global standards we 
create.  This will be a daily reporting package.

Timeline:
August 31 - finalize global standards into 2 buckets
Quantitative (to be reported daily)
Qualitative (to be reviewed within doorstep reviews)
Sept 15 - Establish measurable targets for quantitative standards
Sept 30 - Finalize reporting format for quantitative reporting lines (who do 
we get it from, who consolidates it, who sees it, how often)
Nov 30 - Have reporting implemented - start reporting

Rick,
This is my initial attempt to summarize our meeting with John.  The next 
steps would be to solicit feedback from other interested parties and scope 
the resources and responsibilities.
Ted

Rick Buy, John Lavorato and I met to discuss priorities as it relates to the 
calculation of VAR.  We are making the following recommendations

 1) Inclusion of monthly index positions into VAR calculations as the 
indicies set in North American Natural Gas
 2) Development of a methodology to re-run correlations (factor loadings) 
including criteria, responsibilities and acceptance/rejection criteria
 3) Development of process by which to analyze the output of factor loading 
process.  Database to store output and management reports.
 4) Finalize debate on the calculation of Forward/Forward volatility
 5) Scope a project to analyze the possibility of calculating hourly 
volatility for power.

It was further recommended that we continue to not include unpriced index 
positions in VAR calculation.

ENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.  I am especially 
proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.  
I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that 
you have demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you 
for that.  

Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA 
and Energy Operations this year.  Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make 
sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and 
that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.

To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen 
Corporation -- to survey our organization; to ""take its pulse"" if you will; 
to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we 
could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the ""necessary tools"" 
and breaking down any ""barriers.""  SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants 
who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.  SJBC will 
meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight 
our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments, 
and the like.  This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the 
goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.  
Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that 
input.  

Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC 
consultant.  Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest 
opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we 
cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it 
will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not 
received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts 
with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and 
Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.

Communication is one of excelr's core values.  I want to stress that only 
through open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.

schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on 
August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I 
am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential 
formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind 
the curve.  

Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the 
structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on 
Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are 
flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in 
that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  
Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points 
will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation 
with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he 
wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he 
will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts 
are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly 
comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to 
report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic 
around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I 
had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility 
for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.  
That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that 
down before the end of the month.  

What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The 
summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have 
checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, 
with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  

I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August 
much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL 
operations.  I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, 
rather than arrive at the party late.  ",Non Abusive

Further to our conversation, here are some of the things I thought of while 
speaking with Tom Gros. There are definitely some challenges we have to 
overcome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic.com as successful as 
excelrOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara.

I won't repeat thoughts about how we split CL from excelr, but let's put 
ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a 
potential solution. Well, that's an easy decision, somebody else is doing the 
hard work, and not charging us very much for it. So sign-up, but don't rely 
on anything until we see everything working.

Handling counterparties not using the system
The challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the 
Hub is wonderful, but until everybody is using the Hub, we have to keep other 
procedures and systems going, which stretches resources, Development, IT 
Support and user. This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero - the 
concept is wonderful, but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone 
else one trades with using the system. This is classic Chicken and Egg. Tom 
has a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this. This is taking us 
closer to an outsource-to-Andersen-consulting model which is certainly 
achievable, although not quite such an easy sell.

How much resource is left
The latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people, who 
are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving 
onwards. How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL, and 
then review what is left in the remaining environment. Does it mean we hold 
off doing anything? If we do then increasing volume means that we might end 
up incurring costs for massive numbers of people! We should go through 
costing for ""What happens if we completely stop development of X project?"". 
If that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else 
comes along then it may be cheaper than developing, but I hope in most cases 
it is not!

Start small to prove concept
E.g. first application in April 2001 only covers 20 fields
This is excellent, and we needn't shout it too loud to investors in CL, but 
for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be 
years before we can switch off many internal systems.
We might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 
years out?

Include European aspects from the beginning
This really isn't very difficult so long as one has some long-on-common-sense 
Europeans (not just Brits) involved in both specification and development 
from the beginning, but an as example of how not to do it, look at EnPower 
which took a year to allow just for currencies etc!

80-20 rule for types of transaction
EOL has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first.
Once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting (DTL) and risk 
(RisktRAC?) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on STP, 
and yet-to-become-vanilla products on explicitly different, manual 
approaches. Until that time, we have a strong desire to include as many 
different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system, which 
makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly (Think of 
certain deals in Power99 which are approximations of the actual deals, and 
manually tweaked every so often)

Testing
Tom's first thought is that we could leverage initial users (who would not 
pay) to do much of the testing.
EOL clearly got its testing done, but other experience shows that in order to 
have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different 
phases - component, system, integration, end-to-end, and then user-acceptance.
EOL saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many 
external users early in the process. It did have massive 
resource-commandability and so obtained input from many traders. Do the 
Support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the 
same sort of user attention? Given how often I hear ""short people"", that 
strikes me as something which in London would require significant additional 
resource, even after MG is absorbed.

What else did you come up with?

suggested that Tom visit with both you and Mike while he was in London.  I 
told Mike that I support many of the ideas of CommodityLogic.  However, I 
also told him about my two dark-side fears:  (1)  that IT resources reporting 
to Networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on 
projects that we need, and (2)  taken to the extreme, that this concept would 
disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to 
managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this 
special team for them to handle.  Part of the fun in operations is improving 
things, and I would hate to rob some of our most knowledgeable people of the

Subject: Meeting with Mark Frevert - Should We Move It Up?


Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation 
schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on 
August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I 
am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential 
formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind 
the curve.  

Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the 
structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on 
Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are 
flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in 
that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  
Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points 
will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation 
with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he 
wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he 
will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts 
are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly 
comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to 
report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic 
around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I 
had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility 
for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.  
That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that 
down before the end of the month.  

What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The 
summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have 
checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, 
with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  

I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August 
much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL 
operations.  I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, 
rather than arrive at the party late.

easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes:

What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy
- in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the
YO Ranch or somewhere.   We might spend one night or two - plan something
fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad
with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go
somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.

Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more
special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San
Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.

This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but
provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom
and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.    Maybe we could ""chip in""
varying amounts to Mom and Dad's trip so that cindy and richard could afford
it.

I will give some deep thought over the weekend in the meantime here are some
current thoughts regarding Brent's trip
First I am hopeful that a letter will go out regarding Brent before his trip
and that it clearly states that Brent will continue to report directly to
you (that sends a powerful message locally and globally) Is that going to
occur?
Assuming the above takes place what is the messaage you (Sally) want Brent
to convey on your behalf at each and every meeting he attends with his and
your people.  Thirdly I would suggest that Brent and Scott not try to hit a
homerun on this first trip. You as well as Brent and Scott do not need to
win the respect of Shankman so I strongly urge consistency, maturity and
incredible listening skills in fully understanding the DEPTH and exact
nature of the problems arising so solutions arise from the strength of the
data surrounding the core issues.

I would prepare Brent with any language you would want him to appropriately
respond to possible questions from Sheriff, Dyson, Jordan or anyone else for
that matter who might want to probe into whether all of operations is going
to roll up under you.

Until you have your meeting with Frevert I would offer that any questions
that may come Brent's or Scott's way simply be diplomatically deferred. Have
them make simple I statements ""All I know is that my role here is to.....""
I can't speak to what might be happening with other product lines.""

I will read closely your notes, please have mary solmonson give you a copy
of Freverts talk at the global systems gathering and see if there are a
couple of connection points for you to gateway your vision for global
consistency to align with his.



1) My (Sally) vision for this looks like this....
2) Why it makes sense to do this now? What's at risk if we don't do this
now? Paint a relistic yet challenging picture in hopes that he asks, Are you
Sally up to the challenge?
3) Others support this as well (Does he care, if so who else?)
4) I want to move forward effective .....Do I have your support

If you have some time on Monday let Patti know and I will give you a call.
Assuming that a letter goes out on Brent will you put a letter out on ENA
Risk, Settlementges, Logistics, other staff changes such as Scribner,
Sheila, Hall, etc. If you do not have the time to write it up let me know
and I can support you with a draft for your modification, however I would
want to talk specifics Monday.

I am very excited for you and the organization and remain hopeful that this
is yet another growth experience preparing you for an even greater role

FYI:  Rick agreed with the attached note that I sent him.  By voice mail, I
suggested Ted Murphy as a substitute for Rick Buy for the meeting.  We are
set
for next Thursday, August 17 at 11:45 in Rick Causey's office over lunch.  I
am
meeting with Ted this afternoon to fill him in on the purpose of the meeting
and
to be certain that I have his support.  Rick Causey suggested citing some of

As I indicated in my voicemail message to you, attached is the document 
outlining my notes regarding the infrastructure development that needs to 
occur in order to support an active transportation capacity trading market.  
The transportation world is quickly changing and I believe our ability to 
actively trade transportation is getting ready to multiply.  Whether ENA ends 
up developing a capacity trading system or not, our business in that area is 
going to change immensely and we must be prepared to deal with it as soon as 
possible.

I would appreciate it if you would look at the attached document and review 
the Sitara related projects (all of which we have discussed previously), let 
me know what resources you have available to work on these things, and where 
you see it in the priority list.  Since I do not know what other projects you 
are working on, it is impossible for me to know what is most important, so 
I'd appreciate knowing where you see this fitting in and an estimated time 
for completion.  I'll be more than happy to meet with you to discuss these 
projects again in more detail to help you better understand the needs.

I am working within European Financial Operations on integrating the MG 
companies within the monthly status report for excelr offices - please see 
attached.  The data held so far on this document has been obtained from our 
records but may contain inaccuracies/ommissions due to the disparate nature 
of information.

In order to obtain an update on the progress made with the integration of the 
North American Trading and the Americas Origination companies I was hoping 
that you, or someone within your department, could add a short paragraph 
summarising the status of work taking place on each of the above companies 
and ensure that the details as noted are correct.

Many thanks for your assistance.

draft

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, we'd like to 
outline the following organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions, and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets, 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  
Still under consideration - The excelr Corporate Insurance group under Jim 
Bouillion will now report into the corporate organization under  George 
Wasaff.

Brent Price will be joining excelr Global Markets as Vice President and Chief 
Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of the Chairman, and to 
Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for excelr 
Corp.  He will be responsible to Sally Beck for the business operations areas 
of the businesses.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila 
Glover, business controller for Financial Products;  Todd Hall, business 
controller for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global 
liquids and coal.  In addition, Tom Myers as Director of Accounting.  Brent 
and his team are responsible for all accounting and position reporting issues 
for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the excelr Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.
 
Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments.

As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well 
but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or 
another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable. 
Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible 
for much of what we achieved.

As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been 
significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now 
recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the 
29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas 
Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.

There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit 
from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I 
am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in Oslo 
pushing the weather Risk Management area forward). Attached is a page I put 
together that cover our immediate needs and why Todd is ideally placed to 
potentially add an enormous amount of value to the Continental Power business.

Could we please get together with Brent Price and Mike Jordan and discuss 
whether Todd would be available come over.

To all: 

The proposed sale of HPL to American Electric Power (AEP) has been signed and 
the conditions for the acquisition should be completed within the coming 
months.  Over the next few days, I will be forwarding more details about the 
transition process.  These details will outline the employment opportunities 
and transfer process to AEP.   AEP is eager to complete these arrangements, 
as the pipeline is only as valuable as the people who operate it.

During the transition period, it is important that we keep the pipe line 
operating at our historical level of reliability in order to meet the energy 
needs of our customers.

Regards,
Brian

Subject: Todd Hall

Sally,

As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well 
but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or 
another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable. 
Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible 
for much of what we achieved.

As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been 
significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now 
recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the 
29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas 
Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.

There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit 
from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I 
am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in Oslo 
pushing the weather Risk Management area forward). Attached is a page I put 
together that cover our immediate needs and why Todd is ideally placed to 
potentially add an enormous amount of value to the Continental Power business.

Could we please get together with Brent Price and Mike Jordan and discuss 
whether Todd would be available come over.

Thanks and regards James

1. Put in actual date of reviews of each office - done
2. Indicate the difference between Phase I and Phase II of London are - done
3. Indicate that we are looking at non-wholly owned subsidiaries - done 
(Marnier & EOTT)
4. AS a handout what are things that should have been cleared and weren't - 
attached - also put in global issues
5. Change the timelines for current status & reviews not yet taking place 
(Chicago, EOTT) - done
6. Send you the list of standards - attached on previous message
7. Determine what Now Sarzyna is - it is listed on the excelr Europe current 
status schedule.  It is in Poland, and it is a JY poer station that should be 
operational 
May 00 (not sure if they met the date).  Due to start operations in Q2-3.  
50% owned by excelr.
8. Send you the grid of Europe - sent in previous message.

As far as the global issues are concerned, my recommendations are:

1. Taping of phone lines - we should require for all trading offices
2. Use of mobile phones - we should ban the use of mobile phones to make 
trades
3. Translation of settled contracts - I don't think its worth the cost.  It 
can be done on an as needed basis if there are problems with the contracts 
(although
 since they are already settled it would be unlikely).
4. Enpower - for offices without the critical mass of transactions, Enpower 
is not necessary but some controlled environment is required.  If Enpower is 
not used, 
they must be reviewed more frequently.

On another topic, all of the associates Jana offered and that would fit in 
the role we were discussing are gone (3 were gone by the time we finished our 
meeting). She 
has given me additional resumes - mostly analysts, who would fit the 
position.  However, I was thinking of getting an analyst and then switching 
the person out for
Jenifer Bagwell.  When I interviewed her she wasn't keen on travelling, but I 
think its worth at least a discussion with her (since the position is a 
better fit than her current).  Do you have any thoughts either way?

Let me know if there is anything else I can help with.  You can reach me at

We have been able to work with Legal and Tax  to impact the way our trading 
has been set up in London  and Tokyo to increase our control of the business 
and simplify the requirements for support.

In London, for Equity Trading we will be trading as ECT Investments Inc. (the 
same entity as in Houston).  We will have mirror books in the UK as in 
Houston (e.g. Energy and Energy - London).  We have put a service agreement 
in place setting up a excelr Investment Services Ltd. (uk entity) who will 
trade on our behalf as an agent.  This keeps ENA from establishing a presence 
for Equity Trading in the UK Tax authority.  We pay the UK entity, our 
agent,  a service fee and deduct the service fee on ECT Investment's taxes as 
an expense.  Controls are increased because all the books and reporting 
remains consolidated into one entity. 

In Tokyo, we have started a Rate & Currency Trading Desk.  We initially were 
told by tax that we would have to trade in the name of excelr Japan.  This 
would require separate bank accounts, separate counterparty agreements and 
much more coordination to control.  We and the trader worked with Tax so they 
understood the difficulties that this would present.  Also, Japan did not 
want to assurme the funding requirements for this activity with their office 
and wanted it segregated.  This further understanding caused Tax to push 
further to gather other advise from outside counsel operating in the Tokyo 
market.  
We are and will be able to trade as ENA.  Therefore, the same bank accounts 
and ISDAs may be utilized.  All activity, positions and VAR continues to be 
netted for ENA.  Additionally our counterparties can trade with a trusted, 
established entity, ENA, and we get to net, limiting exposure.

These are two cases where we can impact the structure of the business to 
increase controls and our level of support.  In both cases, joint and 
successful cooperation occurred between trading, tax, legal and operations.

Subject: Trading v Origination Offices

Sally, Brent,
There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by excelr, acted much as trading offices.
Shona and Naomi have worked with the people in New York to put in place extra 
controls so that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in 
New York or London own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate, and some execute for Trading Offices.

is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
All the cc above are bought in to this approach.
What do you require to be comfortable so that we can put it up to Causey and 
Buy?

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Thanks,
Richard

I just want to summarize/clarify our discussions so far on the Commercial=
=20
Support model for excelr Japan.=20

My background:
In Europe the Commercial Support function was divided into a Middle Office=

(MO) and a Back Office (BO) part, with a European controller (Fearnley Dyso=
n)=20
responsible for both functions. For Scandinavia, the only trading office in=

Europe outside of London, I was responsible for both functions, as Local=20
Office controller, reporting into Barry Pearce, who reported to Fearnley. I=

Japan I also have this Local Office Controller function, as being responsib=
le=20
for MO/BO activities in this region. The MO would consist of the trading=20
related functions: Documentation (Capture & Confirmation), Risk Management,=
=20
Settlement and Trade Accounting. The BO would consist of G&A's, Salaries &=
=20
Wages, Tax, Management reporting, Statutory reporting and VAT.=20

Back Office:
I report directly to Cassandra Scultz (VP & CAO of excelr APACHI). As much a=
s=20
possible are to be outsourced to our Sydney office (Heidi Mason, who also=
=20
reports to Cassandra), but some work has to be done in Tokyo. The reasons f=
or=20
this outsourcing decision is enclosed in the Power Point presentation=20
enclosed below. For payments we use Houston Treasury, as they are the only=
=20
ones that can exercise a payment in the banking systems.



Middle Office:

What I have in writing is a section from Joe Hirl's Memo (Request for Japan=

Power Trading Positions (DRAFT)) to Rick Buy and Greg Whalley dated April 1=
9=20
this year (please find enclosed)

Back Office Operations:  Jan Erland Bekeng in cooperation with Sally Beck=

overseen by Anthony Dayao and performed in Houston.



Discussion -  Current & Future Situation
I see more commodities than Power. Metals will arrive September 25, Weather=
=20
is on the way from Sydney, and Garry Hickerson will from September 1 have a=
=20
guy here doing IRFX, Agri and maybe Equity.  We are also looking into Oil=
=20
deals, and have plans for Gas, Coal, Pulp & Paper, Credit and Emissions. Al=
so=20
EBS is on the way. I only see Metals, IRFX and Weather as active desks this=
=20
year, maybe Oil. Power will take some more time to get active, due to the=
=20
very closed market situation here right now. On the Origination side we mig=
ht=20
see some structures/cross commidity/finance deals go through. Thus we have =
a=20
mix of activites from excelr APACHI, excelr Global Markets, EBS and excelr=20
Metals. Basically everyone wants to do some business in Japan.

To coordinate all these activities we need to build the most cost efficient=
,=20
independent, segregated, automised and service minded Japanese Commercial=
=20
Support function possible. To accomplish these objectives, outsourcing to=
=20
Sydney is an alternative that has been discussed extensive lately, and is=
=20
highly recommended from our side. Labour costs in Sydney is 25% of the cost=
s=20
in Tokyo. Due to Sydney's experience and size they are ready to expand and=
=20
take on this project. They already have the segregation and independence in=
=20
place, and would give us an extra layer of segregation in the sense of bein=
g=20
an intermideary between Tokyo and Houston. Bilingual staff would be hired t=
o=20
perform Japanese services, which is widely available in Sydney. And there i=
s=20
only one hour in difference between us. Outsourcing these activities from=
=20
Japan to Australia is a growing trend, and many large corporations have don=
e=20
it this way.

There will be some time from the first trades until functions and commoditi=
es=20
are moved to Sydney. Tokyo want and needs to learn, understand all details,=
=20
automise, make routines and calibrate systems first. On the confirmation si=
de=20
our Legal department would be heavily involved in th start, compared to lat=

stages.

Proposed MO structure for excelr Japan

A) Responsibility for all Commercial Support activities in Japan to be=20
sourced to excelr Japan, under excelr Japan's CFO.

B) Outsource programmable tasks to Sydney:
 - Documentation (Capture & Confirmation)
 - Settlement
 - Trade Accounting

C) Risk Management in Tokyo.

Hello again, and how are you?

I guess you are still as busy as described below, but I hope you got some 
time out from your Friday concept, and have had some time to think about 
Japan. FYI, on Wednesday I will have a confrence call with Brent Price to 
talk about EGM and Japan, from a Commercial Support perspective. 

FYI, I am up in Oslo this week signing off excelr Nordic Energy, and are 
comming to San Antonio next week for this accounting offsite, where I guess I 
will see you? Any news on the offsite you were planning in October with Mike?

 When I left in April for maternity leave, the university had not

made, and
 the winners have been notified. Can you please let Karen and me
know who
 the winners are and who should be invited from the university
for the

work.  I thought that this was going to be corrected last week.  I am 
confused about why we are using a system that does not work.  I understand 
that there are bugs in the system.  Was the system tested before being put 
into production?  

I tried to reach you by phone.  You were unavailable and I could not leave a 
voice mail because that was full.  I talked with Torey Hayden and verbally 
okayed the access for Bob Hall.  

Please call me and let me know when the system will be working correctly and 
how you are going to manage these approvals in the interim while the system 
is not functioning.  You might at least put a contact name and number on 
these things if you are going to continue to send these out before the system 
is fixed.  

My number is 35926.  I look forward to hearing from you on solutions and 
timing.

 Standard:  Brokered deals confirmed within 24 hours (versus the proposed 
same day)

 Function:    Deal Confirmation
 Standard:  Deliver confirmation within 48 hours (versus the proposed 24

In order for us to meet the originally proposed standards, we would either 
require additional staffing or a reduction of the review process for our 
transactions.

Subject: Global Standards

As I discussed in the staff meeting, I am sending you the global standards 
for your review and comment.  Please review these standards to determine if:

The targets set are reasonable for your business and
As minimum standards, they are comprehensive enough (if you would like to see 
additional reporting)

Lastly, in the upcoming month we will start to implement exception reporting 
for these standards.  Please let us know who the key contact in your 
department would be for this implementation.

Please address all correspondence to Michael Moscoso.

Thank you,

Shona

Subject: Trend Analysis for Select Commodity Groups

Attached is a trend analysis on the four primary commodity groups which have 
either been demonstrating, or have been thought to be demonsrating, a decline 
in EOL transactions as a percentage of total trading activity. The graphs for 
each group represent a line plot of EOL's weekly percentage of total trading 
activity by deal count and volume over the last three months. The attachment 
also contains source data on the second and third pages, which gives the 
absolute numbers represented by the percentages shown on the graphs. These 
sheets contain several additional commodity groups which have demonstrated a 
decreasing or erratic EOL trend, but were not graphed because they averaged 
less than 10-15 total transactions (both EOL and non-EOL) per week. 

A few notes on the four graphed commodity groups:

AUSTRIAN POWER -  The overall EOL trend as a percentage of transactions in 
Austrian Power has been upward over the last three months, despite the sharp, 
temporary decrease which took place at the end of July as a result of the 
head Austrian Power Trader and Stack Manager going on holiday. Since his 
return, the percentage has picked back up and as of 8/22 about 30% of 
Austrian Power trades were once again being done through EOL. There is cause 
for concern here, however, in the fact that the absence of one trader 
effectively shut off EOL trading in this commodity group.


LPG - The LPG products have followed a somewhat erratic path since inception, 
with EOL transactions typically accounting for between 20 and 30 percent of 
total LPG trading activity. This overall trend remains intact and as of 8/22, 
EOL accounted for 26% of LPG trades.

Crude & Products - This commodity group has been demonstrating a steady 
decline in EOL trading activity over the last three months. While EOL trades 
accounted for approximately 20% of all crude and products activity in May, 
this percentage has dropped off to just over 10% as of August 22nd. This 
trend is particularly disturbing because of its consistancy, as well as the 
relatively large data pool on which it is based.


UK Power - Although the absolute number of trades in UK Power dropped off 
significantly at the end of July, EOL's percentage of UK Power transactions 
has remained fairly stable. EOL's percentage of UK Power trades ""spiked"" 
briefly during the second week of June, but outside of this the percentage of 
UK Power trading represented by EOL transactions has fluctuated between 20 
and 40 percent. On trade date 8-22, EOL transactions accounted for just over 
50% of all transactions done in UK Power.

DPR.

For each business unit or commodity group in the DPR the graphs show the VaR 
compared to its limit.  

When VaR is under the limit (as in the example on the right), it appears 
green, and the unused portion of the limit appears yellow, which together add 
up to the limit amount.  When VaR exceeds the limit (as on the left), the 
limit is represented in red, and the excess is shown as a red box outlined in 
black.  One graph shows usage in dollar terms and the other as a percentage 
of the individual limits.

We should be able to publish this graph to the web report viewer as soon as 
the web masters have completed the set up.  Meanwhile, we will e-mail these 
graphs to you every day after the DPR is finalized.  Today's are attached 
below.  Please launch the Excel file instead of using the Lotus Notes viewer.

Over the past several months we have been putting together a database to 
standardize and capture the information that flows to the DPR (it is very 
much like the database we created for EOL to report numbers).  With it we can 
perform a variety of analyses (correlations between books, back-testing, 
estimating sensitivities to risk factors, P&L decomposition and attribution, 
etc.).  We are nearly finished with its construction, and we hope to provide 
you superior analytics and reports in the future.

Next week we hope to publish two new graphs: for each business unit in the 
DPR one will have 30 day rolling and 5 day rolling ROVARs (average P&L 
divided by average VaR) and the other will have 30 day rolling and 5 day 
rolling curve shift Sharpe ratios (average delta - gamma P&L divided by its 
standard deviation) .

We hope you find these useful.

Subject: Project Triple Lutz

To date, my primary duties have been to oversee the internal valuation of the 
contracts, and their unwind costs in our Risk books.  I have also been 
involved with the Entex contract valuation.  Dave Baumbach has been the real 
key to providing the data, and has all of the information.  Steve Jackson is 
talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional 
eyes and resources looking at this also.  I feel we have done a thorough job, 
but we do need everyone thinking of ""what if's.""  Our risk books are complex, 
with many hand-offs internally.  Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of 
the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the 
day.  I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.  After our 
meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our 
approach.  There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on 
(Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).

FYI:  I will be out of town on another project all of the week of 8/28 - 9/1, 
and Tuesday, 9/5 and Wednesday, 9/6.  I have made arrangements to ensure that 
I am in Houston on Thursday, 9/7 and Friday, 9/8 for the first visit to the 
Triple Lutz data room.  

In my absence next week, I want to reiterate to each of you that I am 
available, and will have the Triple Lutz data with me.  If any issues come up 
that you feel I can be helpful, please contact yvette Connevey @ 
713-853-5953, and she will get in touch with me.  Once again, DO NOT HESITATE 
TO CALL ME!!!  I do not want anything falling through the cracks!

Subject: Test Results of EOL Management Report

Louise,

I have attached a draft of the newly revised report on our test results of 
the EOL Management Report for your review.  Please keep in mind this is a 
tentative draft.  Mark and Andrew still want to perform some QA on the 
results and Torrey is still looking into some of the observations.  

To summarize, we observed a significant improvement from the last test we 
performed a few months ago.  The systemic problems that created a large 
volume of the discrepancies in our previous testing have been greatly 
reduced.  The majority of the discrepancies identified in the most recent 
testing are primarily a result of random data entry errors and some deal 
booking changes made in the back office without the Product Control Group's 
knowledge.  Torrey has already corrected the most significant discrepancies 
and is continuing to investigate the smaller items.  

Andrew and I will both be on vacation for the week of August 28.  When we 
return, we will set up a meeting with you and Dave to discuss the final 
results once Torrey has had time to conclude his research.

His wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved

Please find below the issues, action taken, and action plan / proposed 
resolution for GCP / SAP / Mid Office Systems interface.
If you have further questions/comments, please feel free to contact me.

Regards,
Janet

Issues:
Brazil and Argentina Tax Code - Counterparty tax code for these countries are 
required in SAP but not in GCP.
Bank Partner Type Changes - Partner bank type changes for counterparties -- 
triggered by master data changes in GCP -- while bank data remains the same, 
resulting in invoices being paid to the incorrect bank and/or bank account.
Ownership - who owns what?

Action Taken:
Brazil and Argentina Tax Code
Meeting took place.  Agreed upon plan is for mid office user to provide tax 
requirements and/or codes to Bill.  SAP is waiting for tax requirements 
and/or codes to determine whether user exits should be disable (these are 
custom user exits SAP has implemented to accommodate the Brazil and Argentina 
tax requirements back from 1/01/00 go-live)
Bank Partner Type
Our understanding is GCP has agreed to modify the GCP program to keep bank 
partner type static.  GCP technical team is developing this solution.
Ownership
Mid Office Users own data
GCP maintains counterparty master data
GCP and SAP ensure that solution in place to move master data from GCP to SAP 
satisfy invoicing and cash processing business requirements.

Summary:
Many meetings have taken place.  Major progress has been made.  Now we need 
to evaluate GCP reengineering initiative to see whether it affects scope  and 
requirements regarding current solution in place for this 3-way interface.

Proposed Resolution:
SWAT team representing both Houston and London to be formed and meet in 
London week of Sep. 11- 15th to:
Address all issues evolving around this interface.
Develop solutions to issues, workplan, ownership, and timeline.
SWAT team members:
Janet Tran - SAP TRAPAR
Pamela LeBrane - SAP TRAPAR
Diem Pham - SAP Technical  -- Will already be in London that week for EEL
Bill Hare - GCP Functional (Houston)
Mary Solmonson - GCP Functional (Global)  -- Will already be in London that 
week for other business

As I told you last week, I laid a big egg and ""put the cat amongst the 
pigeons"" as Steve Stock put it.  Phillipe called a meeting with Rick (and 
me), Debbie Brackett and Steve yesterday to ""clear the air"".  While he 
pledged to be attentive to the problem (as I articulated), he still focused 
on fixing process which I fear gets us to where we thought we were as opposed 
to where we need to be.  I continue to believe that not only are there things 
just plain broken, but what we have gotten used to as ""acceptable"" is now 
inadequate.  This includes the ability for ""human"" systems and processes to 
be automated to avoid stupid downstream data problems as well as improve 
analytics.  You will be cordially invited to be (another) weekly meeting that 
both Rick and Phillipe plan to attend to monitor and guide progress.

Over the past year or so excelr has made a great impact at the University of 
Oklahoma.  In a very short time we have become one of the employers of
of choice within the College of Business.  We have been able to do this by 
paying attention to details and going beyond the necessary.  We have formed
great relationships and planted seeds that will reap benefits for years to 
come, if we do not become complacent.  I for one am an example of the 
impression
that excelr has forged at OU.  I am here because I believe that excelr 
represents one of the greatest opportunities in not only the energy industry, 
but the 
but the business world in general.

I am sending this note because I believe we are taking steps that will lessen 
our momentum at the University of Oklahoma.   I have learned that we will
not be sponsoring any entertainment for our presentation this fall.   As you 
know, last year we sponsored a hypnotist and a drama team for entertainment 
after our presentations.  Being a student at the time I felt this was a great 
idea and I know that my fellow students enjoyed the presentations as well.  
They felt that it was a great opportunity to gain insight from excelr 
representatives as well enjoy the entertainment which we provided.  As I 
understand the A/A program now takes the position that this does not provide 
any residual value for excelr and does not warrant the expense.  I do not 
understand this reasoning and feel that there is great value in such an 
arrangement.  It places another selling point on our presentation and gives 
us a better opportunity to familiarize ourselves with upcoming talent.   This 
may seem like an  insignificant detail,  but I hope we will see the value 
that this opportunity presents.  The students of the EM Program and the J.C. 
Penney Leadership Program are expecting another exciting evening from excelr 
and hate to see us fall short of these expectations.  It is very likely that 
if we do not sponsor this event one of our competitors will.  The competition 
for talent is growing and we can not allow ourselves to become overconfident 
in our recruiting efforts.  excelr is a great place to work and we must take 
that image to campus.   I know that Mr. McConnell is a very exciting speaker 
and will no doubt amaze those present.  That is why we should take this 
simple step to have as many potential leaders present as possible and 
continue our path to recruiting dominance at the University of Oklahoma.

I am fully aware that you were the instrumental element in putting OU within 
excelr's sights.  Your involvement at OU is greatly appreciated and I hope you 
maintain
your interest in the University of Oklahoma.  Please consider my views on 
this matter and express any concerns of your own to the Analyst and Associate 
Program.

Thank You,

Jody Crook

respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an 
informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:

Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other

Recent successes and current projects
Ideas on the horizon
Opportunities in your business unit for AA's 
The benifits of rotation in your business unit
An open Q&A session

These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have 
handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them 
ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current 
AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the excelr 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the excelr 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

Sunday through Wednesday, she will stay at the Grand Hyatt (she doesn't know
the telephone no. - and I am such a busy personal assistant, I don't have

There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by excelr, acted much as trading offices. They are very 
small.
We have worked with the people in Metals to put in place extra controls so 
that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in a 
designated Trading Office own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate (get a price from a Trading Office for every deal), and some 
execute for Trading Offices (are given a range within which they can execute 
trades).

 is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
Tab 'Office Models' shows which functions are performed in which type of 
office
Tab 'Office List' shows the actual offices involved 
We propose to re-examine this methodology in 6 months' time.
Buy-in has been obtained from the cc list and the people on the ground.

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Are you both happy with this approach?
Are there any extra controls you would like to see in place?

FYI - Nice note from the Chicago office regarding the roll-out and training 
in Unify. As you might know they are live on September 1 with Unify. 
Currently they are only pathing on NGPL but we expect them to expand to 
include both Trunkline and Northern Border. They have elected not to EDI 
until  they get more comfortable with the system (maybe for October

We will continue to develop their staff on the use of Unify through

Subject: Summary of Cash Flow Events

Sheila,

We have been having issues with the commodity cash flows since last Friday, 
Aug 25.  This is a listing of what's been going on.


            TIME PDH
DATE     COMMODITY BOOK GIVEN TO TRADER   SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION

8/25/00 ENPOWER - WEST  7:05    Original    West cash flows did not look 
right.  Valerie left voice mail
         late Thursday night stating not to treat the $18M gain as
          final.  She indicated that Lavorato was going to review the
         cash flows  this morning and she will let us know the final
          number at that time.  These cashflows created a $19,000
         PV01 affect. 
        
     7:45    Re-ran w/old West CF  After consulting with Pushkar, we 
replaced  the new west              cash flows with prior days so hedging 
could begin.

    10:15   Final    Spoke with Monica Lande at 9:30am and she stated that 
the             original cash flows received were real. We then had to 
         bring the original cash flows back and re-do the PDH 
         reports.

8/28/00 refer to email sent by Sheila on this day.

8/29/00 UK-NAP-LT-PRC 7:35     Cash flows received from the UK book looked 
really weird. 
         The $38M cash flow curve change created a 15,000 PV01
         affect.  We contacted Guy Freshwater regarding.  He
         indicated that per Mark Fondren, the book was officialized 
         Monday, on Friday since Monday was a Holiday for their 
         Office.  We backed out the new cash flow, and then substituted
         the old ones.

8/30/00 UK-NAP-LT-PRC 7:30  Original    The same thing happened as 8/29/00.  
The book was not officialized  
    7:45  Final    on 8/29, therefore we received the same incorrect cash 
flows.  We again
         substituted these cash flows with those received on 8/25/00.  I 
talked with
         Mark Fondren and he indicated that the book has now been 
officialized.
         (In the past we have not had issues with the UK commodity Books in 
the 
         ERMS system. )

8/31/00 ENPOWER - WEST 7:20  Original    Cash flows received for west created 
a 14,000 PV01 affect.  We contacted
    8:00  Final    Monica Lande and she informed us that there was a $14 M 
loss in their book, 
         but $6 M was not real.  We asked for a cash flow strip for the 
incorrect flows, but          she was not able to provide it.  Therefore, we 
used the previous day's cash
         flows.  After the 7:20 PDH report, the system started running slow, 
therefore
         it took even longer to produce a revised report.

Subject: MG : MO/BO Functional Groups and Reporting Lines

Please find attached a workbook comprising two worksheets. These worksheets 
illustrate how Support for the London based MG businesses - Financial Trading 
and Merchanting - plug in to the excelr Europe framework.



Org

This sheet illustrates the main reporting lines for the Front, Middle and 
Back Office(s) up to the ""Office of the Chair"" for excelr Europe. Though the 
Mechanting business is used for illustrative purposes, for Financial Trading 
simply substitute Mike Farmer and Howard Carter with Michael Hutchinson and 
Kevin Rhodes respectively.

Staff

This sheet simply attaches names to each of the Middle and Back Office 
functional groups indicated in the sheet entitled Org. Staff within the 
Middle Office functional groups have been introduced to the dual reporting 
concept whereby they report to both the Business Controller and Functional 
Lead. 

The intention is that quite soon after moving into excelr House the functional 
teams for both Financial Trading and Mechanting will start to more closely 
together. The influence of the Functional Leads should ensure that these 
teams are blended into a generic excelr Metals support group, where possible 
leveraging across the other trading support groups.

I'm in the process of putting together some slides for the presentation on 
the 7th.  In doing this, I was reviewing the global operations presentation 
and  noted on the global operations initiative slide one of the initiatives 
listed is ""creation of due diligence checklist for acquisitions."" I know 
Naomi Connell has put together the SOAP which her group in London uses for 
this purpose which might be useful.  

Naomi - could you send the three of us a copy of this document?

Meeting.  I regret the delay in processing the minutes.  The career placement 
center has been really busy and I needed to contact them to get some of the 
questions answered from the meeting.  For those of you who were unable to 
attend, I have listed the topics of discussion:

Goals for Wellesley - Hiring goal of 4 (not limited to)
Analyst Program changes - Structure ( Team Leaders), Developmental Program, 2 
day interview process
Interview Training Workshop - Everyone that will be interviewing is required 
to attend a 2 hour session
Roles and Responsibilities - Role of team members, Participation is tracked 
for PRC recognition.
Wellesley Campus Plan
 - We discussed the presentation time being pushed back.  I was able to get 
it pushed back to 5:00  o'clock at the latest.  There are other companies 
scheduled to present on that date and that was the  latest time we coud get.  
There will be no class conflicts on that date (September 28, 2000).   We  
discussed the attire for the presentation being casual (jeans).  That concept 
was  proposed to the  career placement center Assistant (Bernice Tita) and 
she said that casual attire will be well received.   We would need to just 
indicate it when we publicize the event.
 - We discussed changing the interview dates due to scheduling conflicts.  
The dates that we were  able to get were November 20th and 21st. 
 - We discussed possible recruiting at neighboring schools(Smith & Mt. Holy 
Oke)
 - We discussed taking the company jet to some or all the events, especially 
when we will be   involving recruiting efforts at the neighboring schools.
Target Groups -  Economic Student Board Association, All majors

I have forwarded the Wellesley recruiting guide to those of you who were 
unable to attend.  If you have not received it by now, please contact me and 
I will get one to you a.s.a.p.

I have meetings scheduled with Jean Mrha and Cindy Olson to work on the 
participants for the events and afterwards I will get the revised campus plan 
to the team.  If you have any questions regarding the contents of this e-mail

Cindy

Sorry if there was any confusion in my email - it was not actually prompted 
by your questions about Enlighten, which haven't caused ripples and in any 
case are appropriate questions to ask.

I'm really trying to get commitment from business sponsors (principally Mike 
on this side) on both sides of the pond to agree a common timetable for 
functionality.  If we don't get this, it may be difficult for us to maintain 
a common database across Houston and London, and IT will end up acting as a 
broker between different business areas when establishing priorities.  I 
doubt any of us want that.

Cheers

For Global Markets, we were not scheduled to get anything by the end of the 
year from Enlighten, Envoice or DTL.  But in order to establish what could 
potentially be delivered by July 2001, we were inquiring as to the data 
elements that were going to be stored as well as the functionality.  It would 
be hard to make committments to use an application, without really knowing 
what it does.  Clarification was what we were trying to get and will require, 
to do a true gap analysis so we can quantify the extent that these 
applications fit or do not fit our business.  

I received a functional spec for Envoice today and would like to get one for 
DTL and Enlighten to get a better understanding of the scope of these and 
possible enhancements that could be added on later.

I am sorry if my queries caused some ""ripples"".   I still would like some 
tangible information to start looking at regarding these applications.  
Please let me know what information you can supply us.   Thanks    Cindy

Subject: Enlighten Common Timetable

Dear all

There is currently some debate as to what is going to be delivered by 
Enlighten.  Some clarification and a question:

Clarification:
Enlighten (certainly in London) is actually a data hub, rather than an 
application.  In itself, it will not add business value.  However, the tools 
which sit on top of this system will add business value.  These tools are 
currently DTL, Envoice, Zebra.  However, I think we all anticipate more 
requirements being developed as this central data store becomes richer.

Question (for business sponsors):
We are trying hard to coordinate US and UK efforts.  However, this will be 
extremely difficult if our respective business timelines are not the same.  
Say - for example - Mike wants Enlighten to deliver volumetric reporting by 
then end of 2000 but Cindy instead wants a full DPR in the same timeline.  
Our data architects are going to struggle to coordinate and prioritise their 
work if we are working for two separate sets of masters.  So:

If we are really to reap the rewards of a UK/US implementation, a common 
timetable is extremely important.  Who are our primary UK and US business 
sponsors and can we ask them to agree a mutual timeline ?  I suspect if we 
are to try and make this a joint development, nothing will make delivery 
harder than having separate and sometimes mutually exclusive sets of 
requirements from our user communities.  

Comments/answers please...

Cheers

John

things. We made progress.....but we also have issues to work. 


Summary On Improvements For This End Of Month Close

I would like to congratulate the users, the application team and the DBA team 
for a much improved end of month close for August gas. This would not have 
been possible without the significant commitment, focus and teamwork 
exhibited by all the folks involved in this effort. 

The most tangible measure of progress over the July close : 
We were able to keep all users in the system throughout the final week. No 
one was kicked off the system.
The gas accounting close process finished on time. Key users and IT folks 
didn't have to work significant overtime to finish the process. 

 Improvements arose from : 

Upgrading the Unify system to Sybase 12 with extra server memory. This 
reduced system 'locking and blocking' and made it possible to keep all users 
in the system throughout the week. Nightly settlements for gas invoicing also 
ran much faster. Many thanks to the DBAs - Jim Ogg and Kishroe Bharathi-- for 
many late nights and weekends. Many thanks also to the application team and 
the users for lots of testing before the production rollout.

Conducting a pre-planning session that identified new end of month techniques 
to improve efficiency. The users generated several new ideas including the 
idea to pre-process PMAs the night before running the current mass draft. 
This meeting provided several new approaches, a clear plan and cohesive 
communication throughout the end of month process. Many thanks to the all the 
users as well as Bob Superty, Bryce Baxter, Melissa Ratnala, Dave Nommensen 
and Chris Schomer for making this happen. Many of these ideas will now be 
part of a standard process. 

The performance monitoring and tuning team reacted quickly to address changes 
in system performance. Many thanks to Matt Pena and the rest of this team for 
keeping the system up and running as fast as possible during the day. 

Release of a new tuned version of the Accurals process that runs much faster. 


Issues, Challenges, Action Items

While we made progress this month, there are still several significant issues 
and opportunities for improvement. The following is a list of the things that 
'went bump in the night' and the action items we've identified. 

1. We experienced several Sybase 12.0 errors early in the week that impacted 
gas business. All of these problems are now fixed. This had the following 
business impacts: 
The bridgeback of deals to Sitara was delayed. These deals were bridged 
manually before the end of month valuation. We also fixed the code problem 
that generated th original problem.
Global Systems replication to Unify was down on Monday. This problem was 
fixed with a software patch from Sybase Monday evening. All affected deals 
were then uploaded. Nominations were completed for these deals on Monday 
through manual estimation by the schedulers. 
Communication between the DBA group and the application group was delayed on 
the Global Systems replication problem. This delayed our ability to notify 
users of the problem. Communication on problems will be be improved in the 
future. The default assumption will be to notify key application and 
infrastructure personnel as soon as any serious problem is identified. 

2.  We experienced a hardware issue with a bad server CPU at 3:00AM on 
Thursday.  As a result, database backups ran into the morning when the server 
came back up. This created slow system response and delayed logins for users 
until 10:00 AM. This problem is now fixed. 
 Action Item: Kishore will coordinate with Randy Matson from the 
infrastructure group to coordinate a stress test of all production server 
components. This will allow us to see if we can find any other marginal 
components.  This will be completed by September 18. 

3. All service PMAs for ENA and HPLC were not picked up by the Settlements 
process. HPLC PMAs were run manually by the users. For ENA, missing PMAs were 
immaterial and the users decided to close with these results. We have now 
found and fixed the error that caused this problem. 
 Action Item: Chris Schomer is having his team investigate this problem to 
see if this is just a Sybase 12.0 issue or whether this error could have 
impacted previous months. A determination should be available by September 
15. 

4. Enpower deal load did not load deals with referenced prices correctly. 
These deals have now been successfully loaded and are currently completed 
through the mass draft process for power. We have identified and fixed the 
software error that caused this problem. 

5. Power mass draft is now running very slow as compared to prior months. We 
are currently working to complete the Power mass draft process. It will be 
completed by the user deadline for close of business Wednesday Sept. 6. 
 Action Item: Chris Schomer's team is investigating why the Power mass draft 
is running so slow.  At present we do not have a definitive answer. We hope 
to develop a definitive answer and action plan by September 15. Our current 
hypothesis for why we have this problem includes : 
Data changes - we now have a much higher volume of hourly priced deals
Potential database index issues. We will re-build all power database indexes 
and re-compile the stored procedures
Sybase optimizer flakiness. We often see Sybase suddenly start to have 
processing problems for no apparent reason.  


Update On Future Tactical  And Strategic Improvements

We have several pending tactical Unify performance improvements that are in 
process. These include: 

1) Isolating Unify Gas on a server of it's own 
2) Delivery of a middle tier mass draft process to reduce locking and blocking
3) Upgrade of the middle tier mass draft process to allow for drafting at a 
deal level (rather than just a counter-party level)
4) Delivery of the nominations and balancing process on a middle tier 
architecture.

Ramesh Rao and his team have the strategic projects progressing on schedule.  
We are seeing significant performance gains in our testing of SQL Server over 
Sybase. We also have identified a couple of hardware vendors that could 
provide very large, scaleable computing environments for this type of Unify 
architecture. We plan to have all critical evaluation testing completed by 
the end of September as planned. We will present our recommendations along 
with a high-level strategic delivery plan by early October.

Some of you were contacted earlier this year by Cliff Baxter, excelr's 
representative on the Junior Achievement Board of Directors, regarding 
participation in excelr's Junior Achievement program.  Since so many changes 
have occurred within ENA since that time, we are renewing our request and 
broadening it to reach more departments.

One of the programs that we wish to support through Junior Achievement is Job 
Shadowing.  This program's objectives are to demonstrate why a sound 
education, interpersonal skills, and a strong work ethic are needed to 
succeed in the work place.  A successful Job Shadowing program requires your 
department's commitment and participation.

The Job Shadowing program consists of the following:

 9:00 - 10:30 AM  Welcome, Company Overview, Video, and Tour 
 10:30 - 12:00 N  Job Shadow Experience with excelr Employees and/or 
Departments
 12:00 - 1:00 PM  Lunch for Students with Mentors and Closing Comments

excelr has agreed to accept 16 high school juniors and seniors on the second 
Wednesday of each month from October 2000 through April 2001.  We need your 
assistance in hosting students within your department during the 10:30 AM - 
12:00 Noon period.   Students may be either paired up one-on-one with 
employees or may remain in groups of 2-4.  Employees participating in Job 
Shadowing will also be invited to join their students for a quick lunch and 
closing comments.  If enough departments participate, it is possible that 
each department may only be needed on a quarterly basis.

Although we have identified two individuals to provide the company overview 
and tour, we are also accepting additional volunteers in this area.  Please 
advise if anyone in your department is interested in assisting.

Please provide the following information to Nicki Daw or Susan Skarness by 
August 30, 2000.

DPR: 

Return on VaR (ROVAR)
Curve Shift P&L (Delta - Gamma) Sharpe Ratio
Risk - Return (Large)
Risk - Return (Small)

All of these graphs deal with the concept of risk-adjusted return.  The 
markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics.  Furthermore, 
excelr's appetite for risk also differs in each market.  As a result, it is 
difficult to compare returns in absolute terms.  Therefore, the approach of 
these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk, in effect restating 
return numbers into a standard base (how many dollars we earn for every 
dollar we put at risk).


 For each business unit or commodity group, the ROVAR graph shows an average 
of daily total P&L divided by an average of daily VaR.  Higher ROVARs 
indicate better performance (relative to other business units).  For each 
business unit or commodity group there are two bars: the dark blue on the 
left shows ROVAR on a 4 week (20 business day) rolling basis, and the light 
blue on the right shows ROVAR on a 1 week (5 business day) rolling basis.  
Because of the shorter term, the 1 week ROVAR is more sensitive: it can be 
quite high or low, and it changes frequently.


The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept; it shows an average of 
daily curve shift P&L (both delta and gamma) divided by its standard 
deviation. This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non-trading P&L (like new 
deals, reserves, and so forth).  Furthermore, whereas VaR is a forward 
looking statistic (the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given 
probability), standard deviation is backward looking (the actual volatility 
of our returns over the period). This graph also has two bars for every 
business unit or commodity group: a dark brown on the left showing the Sharpe 
ratio on a 4 week rolling basis, and a light brown on the right showing the 
ratio on a 1 week basis.

The Curve Shift P&L Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other 
well.  They measure different things, but if our P&L is composed mostly of 
curve shift, and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift volatility, the two 
statistics should be very close.


Sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the P&L relative 
to the risk.  We therefore put together the Risk - Return graphs.  On the 
vertical axis, they show 4 week rolling average P&L.  On the horizontal, they 
show 4 week rolling average VaR.  The various business units are plotted as 
points on the graphs.  These graphs are closely related to the 4-week ROVARs, 
in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is 
the business unit's ROVAR (average P&L / average VaR).  Another way of 
looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin 
(0,0) with the plotted point of a business unit is its ROVAR.  Books with 
small risks and returns (< $2 million) are plotted on the ""Small"" graph, and 
the rest, on the ""Large"".

These graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize and 
capture the information that is reported in the DPR.  Most, but not all of 
the information in the DPR currently flows from the database.  As a result, 
we do not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit.  As we 
continue to set up exports into the database, we will fill in the missing 
numbers.

We will e-mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the 
intra-net.  Please remember to launch the file in Excel, instead of using the 
Lotus Notes viewer.  The VaR Limit Usage graphs that we created last week are 
already on the web.  We hope that you find all of these useful.

Mike,
I don't understand the question.  London informatiion was not complete in the 
Corporate system at  11:00 Houston time.  Either London operations or Houston 
operations did not do something.  To me that is the breakdown.  I don't have 
any further knowledge nor do I expect to have any further.  The point of my 
e-mail is to alert you to a reality that I would prefer you not have to deal 
with, i.e., incur the rath of Dave Delainey, John Lavorato, Mark Frevert and 
Jeff Skilling when they understand what happened and based on what inadequate 
management information they were forced to make decisions with.  As I said, I 
am not telling on anyone or accusing anyone of anything but I can virtually 
guarantee the reaction of those people if this were to come to light.  So, I 
suggest that you talk to Sally and create a process by which to insure that 
the possibility of it happening again is minimized.

Subject: London Risk Reporting

Well,
today (or rather yesterday) it happened.  We have been pushing our limits 
hard and the makets here have been very volatile.  We had a large increase in 
North American Natural Gas VAR due to the breaking apart the Rockies/SoCal 
basis correlation.  This am, we were attempting to get firm numbers on the 
effect on our corporate limits so that we could provide 
Jeff/Delainey/Lavorato/Buy/.... the information to make decisions whether or 
not to reduce positions.  The number was not firm until 11 am houston time.  
My understanding is that the Houston numbers were all in before 8 am and that 
we were waiting for London.  While I am sure that there are issues all around 
and I do not think that anyone Senior in Houston is even aware, let alone 
prepared to blame, I fear that this will not always be the case.  I think 
something needs to be changed in our process so that this can be avoided in 
the future.   

Please do not take this as a nasty-gram.  No one is cc'd or bcc'd.  I just 
think that it will be deemed unacceptable.
Any thoughts/comments?
Ted

  While I think it makes sense for this type of information to be available, 
that it should be done by Operations, and that Eugenio has the skills and 
knowledge to articulate it well, I have some concerns.   First and foremost, 
the process of creating a standard risk metric belongs to RAC, I believe.  To 
me this is no different than VAR, or the Capital Pricing methodololgy, or the 
RAROC process.   This has been published without even a review from our 
group, which I think is inappropriate for two reasons: 1) we might disagree 
and, as stated above, I think we have the final say, and 2) we can't quality 
control it and all the reciepients think that I have.  Second, this has been 
developed in isolation when in fact we have been doing similar things for the 
past 2 years. We report these to the Board and have published to the Desk 
heads on a monthly basis returns by trader.  Clearly, there could have been 
some benefit in each direction if we were told that this was a goal of this 
group, particularly when we fundamentally agree that this group should be 
doing these things.  Thirdly, it is a little irritating when someone sets up 
a process in isolation for what may appear to be ""show-time"" when my group is 
spending hours and hours analyzing the output of existing process because the 
data integrity is so bad (double mapping of portfolios, books not 
officialized......) - we have at least attempted to take both parts of the 
equation, Eugenio has chosen to focus on the cool part.  Now I would be a 
little less concerned if on almost every day, Eugenio wasn't in my morning 
meeting contributing virtually nothing, i.e., this doesn't appear to be 
oversight on his part.

I would prefer to not make a big deal out of this, but rather take it as an 
opportunity to clarify and shift some responsibilities.  In the big scheme of 
things it is a move in the right direction.

Penny for your thoughts

Subject: Four New Graphs

We have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the 
DPR: 

Return on VaR (ROVAR)
Curve Shift P&L (Delta - Gamma) Sharpe Ratio
Risk - Return (Large)
Risk - Return (Small)

All of these graphs deal with the concept of risk-adjusted return.  The 
markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics.  Furthermore, 
excelr's appetite for risk also differs in each market.  As a result, it is 
difficult to compare returns in absolute terms.  Therefore, the approach of 
these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk, in effect restating 
return numbers into a standard base (how many dollars we earn for every 
dollar we put at risk).


 For each business unit or commodity group, the ROVAR graph shows an average 
of daily total P&L divided by an average of daily VaR.  Higher ROVARs 
indicate better performance (relative to other business units).  For each 
business unit or commodity group there are two bars: the dark blue on the 
left shows ROVAR on a 4 week (20 business day) rolling basis, and the light 
blue on the right shows ROVAR on a 1 week (5 business day) rolling basis.  
Because of the shorter term, the 1 week ROVAR is more sensitive: it can be 
quite high or low, and it changes frequently.


The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept; it shows an average of 
daily curve shift P&L (both delta and gamma) divided by its standard 
deviation. This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non-trading P&L (like new 
deals, reserves, and so forth).  Furthermore, whereas VaR is a forward 
looking statistic (the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given 
probability), standard deviation is backward looking (the actual volatility 
of our returns over the period). This graph also has two bars for every 
business unit or commodity group: a dark brown on the left showing the Sharpe 
ratio on a 4 week rolling basis, and a light brown on the right showing the 
ratio on a 1 week basis.

The Curve Shift P&L Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other 
well.  They measure different things, but if our P&L is composed mostly of 
curve shift, and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift volatility, the two 
statistics should be very close.


Sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the P&L relative 
to the risk.  We therefore put together the Risk - Return graphs.  On the 
vertical axis, they show 4 week rolling average P&L.  On the horizontal, they 
show 4 week rolling average VaR.  The various business units are plotted as 
points on the graphs.  These graphs are closely related to the 4-week ROVARs, 
in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is 
the business unit's ROVAR (average P&L / average VaR).  Another way of 
looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin 
(0,0) with the plotted point of a business unit is its ROVAR.  Books with 
small risks and returns (< $2 million) are plotted on the ""Small"" graph, and 
the rest, on the ""Large"".

These graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize and 
capture the information that is reported in the DPR.  Most, but not all of 
the information in the DPR currently flows from the database.  As a result, 
we do not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit.  As we 
continue to set up exports into the database, we will fill in the missing 
numbers.

We will e-mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the 
intra-net.  Please remember to launch the file in Excel, instead of using the

already on the web.  We hope that you find all of these useful.

Sheila
Changes to the manual list for North America need to be authorized by Wes and 
Sally.  We are specifically limiting the number of signers.

I think that what we need to do is immediately address the issues that are 
causing your wires to miss the standard process.  We did not have the issue 
prior to SAP.

Please outline your processing requirements and we can work together with AP 
and SAP to fix the underlying issue.  
Thanks for the help.

Subject: Manual Wires

Mary, Larry and Wes,
We just received a faxed copy of the Manual Wire and Same Day Payment memo 
which was sent by Betty Tauzier on 8/28/00.
Rate & Currency trades fx which is settled the following day and requires 
next day payments for FX.  Currently we are severely hampered because our 
infomation is required into Unify by 2:30 for an Accounts Payable run at 4:00 
for next day payments.  We are still trading after these cut-offs and tying 
out the day's activity with Trading.  Therefore, we currently have to rely on 
manual wires to make payments to our counterparties on the value date.  

We need to get timeframes which mirror our business requirements.  I would 
like to get the Accounts Payable run for our companies, 842 and 967, moved to 
after 5:00 pm.  Information is not due to the bank until next day. 8:00 am 
London time.

Please let Laurel and me know what changes can be done to our processing 
flows.
Thanks. Sheila

Hi Nicki,
Thanks for setting up the meeting next Wednesday (9/20) at 2:30 with M.=20
Frevert, D. Delainey, J. Shankman, and J. Lavorato.  Here is a brief overvi=
ew=20
of the meeting objective:

Purpose
To gain support and approval for a data warehouse vision containing=20
consolidated trade information with centralized access.

Background
The definition of a data warehouse is a place to consolidate information=20
originating from multiple transaction processing systems and platforms into=
 a=20
common database repository.  The idea of an excelr =01&Trade Warehouse=018=
=20
originated from members of the London office and has been expanded to inclu=
de=20
the Houston systems.  The need for a Trade Warehouse stems from the=20
requirement of multiple departments needing to access consolidated deal=20
information for analytical reporting and down-stream processing.   Currentl=
y,=20
deal information is held in separate trading systems both within product=20
process flows from mid to back office, and across product lines. The=20
information is also stored across multiple system platforms and is not easi=
ly=20
accessible or consistently presented across the various trading products=20
within excelr. Given this current architecture, it is very difficult and=20
costly to access timely, quality-assured, and consolidated cross-product de=
al=20
information for analytical reporting and down-stream processing.

Proposal
Houston will use the warehouse as the data source for EnTelligence and=20
numerous analytical reporting application systems.  These analytical=20
reporting application systems can include, but are not limited to,=20
Operational Pricing Module (OPM), excelrOnline, and Daily Position Report=20
(DPR).  Once the warehouse is in place, it may be used as the source for=20
additional downstream systems as well as Investor Relations reporting.

DealBench is a way to streamline processes to efficiently execute

tools - document sharing, multi-media, auctioning, secure communication, and 
deal management.   There are five primary products offered which utilize the 
tools provided...  Bank Products, Structured Products, Commercial Paper, 
Procurement, and Legal Space. 

1) Bank Products - deal management for issuance of debt offerings (credit

2) Structured Products - deal management for initial issuance or re-sale of 
bonds, leveraged leases and other financial transactions
3)  Commercial Paper - deal mgmt for issuance of CP
4)  Procurement - management of wholesale purchasing and selling of various 
products
5)  Legal Space - designed to meet the needs of attorneys at law firms (doc 
sharing, aggregation and organization in a secure environment)

Friday (or you can bring it up if you would like...).  The only real system 
issues we have (outside of excelrOnline IT resources!) are the bridge 
resources.  Currenlty, EOL deals bridge to TAGG, Sitara, and Enpower.  We 
have had some issues in the past trying to get bridge issues corrected, and 
nail down reasons for bridge failures (among other things).  The problem has 
arisen due to the fact that each bridge really only has one person that is 
fully capable of correcting problems, and until last week, these three 
individuals really did not have anyone defining the bridge as part of their 
day to day responsibilities.  When Tom Moore left early this year, these guys 
were left in limbo.  Luckily, they were seldom out, and all three of them 
were very good at getting back to us for the most part.  

Now for the good news - Jennifer and I had a meeting with Richard Burchfield 
last week - the bridges are now part of his world.  This was initiated by a 
memo Jennifer copied Beth on regarding bridge failures.  I will forward this 
to you as well.  Richard understands the importance of the bridge and ensured 
us that he will add some structure to this group.  It is especially critical 
when the Sitara bridge goes down late morning, and we are doing next day 
physical deals on excelrOnline.  I have a good working relationship with him 
(from the old Synergi days), so I think this will be great for us.  I 
provided him copies of the IT Compliance flow charts related to the bridges 
so that he could gain an understanding of how they work.   Since this 
meeting, Jennifer has contacted additional resources that Richard referred us 
to, and they have been very responsive (one of the guys volunteered his pager 
and told us to call him any time regarding any bridge...).  So, that said, 
hopefully our only ""issue"" is correcting itself due to Jennifer's 
perseverance!

Apart from that, we do have an item on our wish list (excelrOnline IT) to 
simplify the messages that are sent across the bridges to hopefully speed up 
processing time.  Right now the bridges have to do a lot of thinking to 
determine how to book certain deals - we want to eliminate that thinking by 
adding a deal type identifier on the deal which will automatically tell the 
bridge what to do.  I can give you more details on this if you'd like, but 
this is short and sweet explanation...

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Bridge Problems

Over the last 8-10 business days, we have had a some issues on the bridges. I 
want to educate you a little bit on what can cause 
""bridge problems"".

First, what I want to explain is their is ONE GUI bridge application for 
users (backoffice users) to monitor the bridge but there are MULTIPLE
systems that excelrOnline transactions can be pointed to downstream. This is 
important to understand because if you do not know this ,
it may seem like we are having the same problem over & over; ie ""the bridge 
is having problems"". But in actuality, it is DIFFERENT 
problems. Still not good - but at least it cannot be isolated to ONE 
problem.   

Also, due to multiple systems (Sitara, Enpower, GasDesk, Tagg/ERMS, 
Powerdesk) are listening for messages from one excelrOnline, 
a ""bridge"" problem could be one of many issues. Some of which are:

 The server for excelrOnline  messenger goes down (doesn't send message to 
bridge to process)
 The excelr network goes down (cannot send message thru bridge)
 The NFS server (excelr main server) goes down
 Sitara server goes down
 Enpower server goes down 
 Tagg/ERMS server goes down
 Deal worker in ANY system gets ""hung up""
 Huge volume slows down processing time for one or more downstream systems
 Scheduled outage for maintenance on server on weekend was not re-started on 
Sunday 

and the list goes on.....................................

FYI In the past week & 1/2, the following actions happened, which caused 
""bridge"" problems. 

 Scheduled outage for maintenance on TAGG/erms server on weekend was not 
re-started on Sunday (not smart)
 The NFS server (excelr main server) goes down (affected Sitara & Tagg/ERMS)
 Deal worker in Sitara system got ""hung up"" and servers had to be bounced
 Member of excelrOnline Dev Team changed data for specific tokenised periods 
during trading hours instead of end of day
  (This failed deals in bridge for Sitara & Tagg/ERMS)

One thing to remember is you are getting calls from traders & back office. 
Traders are calling because they cannot see deals in their
position manager application of their system. If they are gas traders, if 
could be Sitara or Tagg system. If they are a power trader
calling, they cannot see it in Enpower. ecetera, ecetera

If a back office person calls, they are watching the monitor GUI and they can 
see deals queing/backing up and know there is a problem. 

We are working to resolve some of these issues, particularily, 
multi-processing tools, as we know the # of transactions will only increase.
Please feel free to email me if you have any questions. I hope this was 
helpful.

See below for explanation of problem on Wednesday.

Subject: Sitara Production Problem


I am forwarding a message that explains the Sitara Production problems from 
this morning. Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Karie (36759)




At  9:50am this morning a DealWorker process in the Sitara system became 
unresponsive. 
At  10:00 am it was determined that the EOLBridge in sitara was not 
processing new deal requests
and diagnostics lead to an indication that the dealworker was not functioning 
properly.
At 10:14, am the Dealworker was forced down and a new one restarted.
At 10:21 am , the EOLBridge began processing deals.

The cause of the is difficult to determine, but indicators point to an error 
in the CORBA product we are using, 
most likely due to scalability issues of that product and of Sitara. This is 
an issue that is actively being addressed.

 Per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a Weather 
Trading and Valuation engine.  I have discussed the high level requirements 
with Joseph Koothrappaly and have identified an IT lead to manage the 
project. As discussed, the project will have the same project formula as the 
""Thunderball"" project with 3-6 month deliverables. Also, the need to have 
co-operative development between Houston and London will be established for 
Global roll out of the Weather system. The main focus will be a intranet 
trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine. The plan calls 
for Phase I roll out for January 1, 2001.   Next steps will need to be 
discuss as soon as possible.  Topics that need to be addressed are definition 
of Phase I, joint development between Houston and London, and duel 
development between Steve Stock's valuation team and my trading team. Keep in 
mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments, one person 
will manage the effort across teams.

Attached are two versions (Word and Power Point) of a flier regarding the
excelr Informational Meeting next Tuesday (September 19th).

As the flier states, Mike McConnell, an OU graduate and a graduate of this
program (formerly known as PLM), will be the main speaker. Mike is a former
landman and is a very dynamic speaker. Mike recently assumed the position of
President and CEO of excelr Global Markets, L.L.C.. Though many of you have
heard him before. Mike has a completely new and exciting power point
presentation he will give. Not only will he talk about new things going on
at excelr and in the energy business, he will also discuss what is going on
in Exploration & Production too. It is my understanding he will also give a
fascinating demonstration about excelr On-Line ( excelr's revolutionary idea
that has completely changed the way gas and other commodities are now
traded).

I realize many of you have night classes (i.e.. Oil and Gas Law, etc) and
cannot miss it. However, you need to plan on attending the social, after
class, at Coach's. Jody Crook, Sally Beck (Vice President of Energy
Operations) and  Lexi Elliott (excelr's new college recruiter) will be here,
along with other excelr representatives, to meet and visit with you about
career opportunities with excelr and discuss questions you might have about
the energy industry in general.

Also, excelr will have a booth at the Career Fair the following day
(Wednesday, Sept. 20th). You should also plan on going to that and visiting
with them and the other companies that will also be on campus to look at EM
students too. This will give you a good comparison of what type of
opportunities that are out there and to compare the management styles of
each of these companies. I know that excelr invites comparison, as they have
obviously been very successful with their style.

Again, I expect all of you that do not have class conflicts, or try to make
arrangements to have someone cover for your class,  to attend all or at
least the social part of this presentation. Needless to say, excelr, and
especially Mike McConnell, are taking the time and expense to come up and
visit with you and to look at this program. It was this program and both Ms.
Beck's and Mr. McConnell's support, that first brought excelr to OU. We need
to make the same type of commitment to them and show them how much we
appreciate excelr's support of our program and the hiring of OU students. The
new ""Participation Point  Policy"" will be in effect for this and attendance
and non-excused absences will be noted.

For your information, this week is the week to sign up for excelr interviews,
through the Career Services website. excelr is scheduled to be here on
Monday, October 9th for first round interviews. If you make it to the second
round, those will take place on Tuesday, October 10th. So be aware of your
schedule to allow for interview times for both Monday and possible Tuesday
when interviewing with excelr.

Should you have any questions, or have problems opening these attachments,
please let me know.

See you at the EMSA meeting on Sunday night (e-mail coming) and next week at
""An Evening with excelr"".

your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards.  I am sure 
that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody and Nate

great job in changing and promoting the program.  

I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer

After speaking with Richard Burchfield and Brian Hudson, I thought that it 
would be appropriate to update both of you and Beth as to IT's commitment.  
Richard asked that he send out the message and I agreed.  One reason for 
doing this was to show that the Operations and IT groups are working together 
towards a common goal.  The other reason was to ensure that I had IT's buy-in 
to completing this database in a timely fashion.

Our main goal will be to deliver the basic tools that any trading business 
would need and then to continue to develop the more advanced analytics in Q1 
2001.  The actual roll out will happen in phases prior to January so that we 
begin the new year with a complete database which includes deal capture, 
valuation, and the necessary reporting and accounting tools.  By using Brian 
Hudson's IT team I can be assured that the global needs are met.

I will be in the office next week if you want to discuss this further,

Subject: Weather

Todd,
 Per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a Weather 
Trading and Valuation engine.  I have discussed the high level requirements 
with Joseph Koothrappaly and have identified an IT lead to manage the 
project. As discussed, the project will have the same project formula as the 
""Thunderball"" project with 3-6 month deliverables. Also, the need to have 
co-operative development between Houston and London will be established for 
Global roll out of the Weather system. The main focus will be a intranet 
trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine. The plan calls 
for Phase I roll out for January 1, 2001.   Next steps will need to be 
discuss as soon as possible.  Topics that need to be addressed are definition 
of Phase I, joint development between Houston and London, and duel 
development between Steve Stock's valuation team and my trading team. Keep in 
mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments, one person 
will manage the effort across teams.

study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President.  
This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.

It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the 
Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists 
and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.  I learned recently that Yvonne 
has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and 
above.

Todd Burke, who recently joined excelr, will be conducting the market survey 
and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful 
experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are 
fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient 
thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of 
your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the 
analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a 
vested interest in the success of this project!

Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and 
below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of 
Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for 
key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate 
further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.

You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will 
detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.

Hi Jonathan,

 Listed below are the details of each days problems:

Fri, Sep 8,2000
AutoRho failed at 3:15am, uploaded only 8 books into Infinity.
It failed on the step in AutoRho where it runs the query to get all the books 
for the Infinity USD portfolio.  Jeremy does not know exactly what caused it 
but rerunning AutoRho seemed to work.
Recovery used the backup file and was on time.

Tue, Sep 12,2000
Similar problem to Friday, but ENPOWER also failed.  The manenpower.txt file 
had TNS errors in it.  AutoRho was not able to kick off the ENPOWER script to 
get the cashflows.  Rerunning fixed the problem.
AutoRho failed at 3:15am, uploaded only 9 books into Infinity.
It failed on the step in AutoRho where it runs the query to get all the books 
for the Infinity USD portfolio.  Jeremy does not know exactly what caused it 
but rerunning AutoRho seemed to work.
Recovery used the file that Jeremy provided in the rerun, they were 
approximately 10 minutes late.

Wed, Sep 13,2000
ENPOWER failed creating a header ONLY manenpower.txt file.  There was no 
cashflows in the file.
Jeremy confirmed the Autorho process was fine.
The problem was the ENPOWER databse failed (hardrive failure) and they 
immediately went to a backup.  But on the backup database, NOT all the tables 
are replicated.  The cashlow table with the ENPOWER data we needed was not in 
the backup database resulting in a file with zero flows!
This problem has been fixed by the enpower people.
Recovery included using the previous day's enpower flows.  They were on time.

Thurs, Sep 14,2000
AutoRho at 3:15 am and 11:00 pm was hung.  Enpower also was not run since 
AutoRho failed.
Reason was because the UNIX NFS file system ""solar"" was full  As a result, 
our directory /worksheets2, and also /prod/egs-home is mounted on solar but 
could not write anything to it.  Supposily the SA are suppose to have been 
paged when ever a file system gets close to 100% (can you please confirm 
this?).  The Unix NFS was fixed by 5:00 am.  AutoRho was rerun and was fine.
Recovery included Jeremy's file.  They were 1 hour late (partly due to other 
reasons on MO side, not system related).

Thanks,
Kevin Lee

Now he would like for us to draft an agreement, with associated costs, to

and the draft of that agreement is also attached.

I have a starting point for us, using the Bridgeline Services agreement (copy

us to learn from those issues and avoid them for this deal.   Additionally, I 
have asked Shari Mao to put together costs of salaries and other associated 
costs for the positions listed on the org chart.  We should view the costs 
from the perspective that the infrastructure is a stand-alone entity.  All 
costs that would be incurred as a stand-alone should be recovered in the 
bid.  The meeting on Monday will be a working meeting to ensure we have 
addressed all concerns and issues, and ensure the bid is appropriate.  Brian

Subject: Upcoming Compensation Analysis


To All Energy Operations Directors:

My name is Todd Burke and I'm a Compensation Specialist with ENA Human 
Resources (see attached bio).  As you know, Sally Beck has requested that I 
conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current pay arrangements for all 
Energy Operations staff.  The purpose of this analysis will be to ensure that 
the department's current pay arrangements are in line with the competitive 
marketplace.  Each component of pay will be examined individually and within 
the context of excelr's compensation philosophy (e.g., base salary, bonus, 
long-term incentives and total compensation).

The process will begin with a series of interviews which will be conducted in 
two stages:  

Stage 1-Data Gathering:  the focus of this stage will be upon gathering data 
around your perceptions of your group's current pay arrangements and give you 
the opportunity to address any of the internal and external inequities you 
perceive to exist.  

Stage 2-Job Matching:  the focus of this stage will be on job matching - we 
will establish a mutually agreed upon time to meet and discuss which 
positions in our salary surveys most accurately reflect the roles and 
responsibilities of your staff.  We will not be able to match 100 percent of 
your jobs to the jobs contained in the salary surveys.  Non-benchmark jobs 
will be reviewed using a job ""slotting"" approach.

To help facilitate the matching process, I will be assembling handouts 
containing the job descriptions taken from the relevant salary surveys which 
I will send to each of you in advance of our Stage 2 meeting.  The intent 
here is to give you the opportunity to ""pre-match"" your respective jobs 
thereby minimizing the time required to achieve this objective during our 
Stage 2 meeting.  It will be critical that you are comfortable with the 
matches that you agree to as these matches will be used when gathering 
relevant market data.  The data will only be as good as the matches.

Following the conclusion of Stage 2, I can begin gathering the market data 
based on the results of the job matching exercise and prepare a comparative 
analysis that I will be presenting to Sally Beck.

I will be contacting each of you in the next few days to set up the Stage 1 
interviews.  I look forward to working with each of you and to the successful 
completion of this project.

Please call with any questions or comments.  I can be reached at X39437.  

Kind Regards,

Todd Burke
ENA Compensation

Ladies,

To the best of my knowledge, this is the list of items and next steps we 
outlined in our meeting:

1)  ZICI--if errors are made in entry, you must exit and rebook to create a 
2-sided entry.  Diana McLaughlin to review.

2)  ZICI--Prepays on intercompany foreign invoices.  Laurel to contact Pamela 
Lebrane and establish a game plan.

3)  ZICR--report to identify items to be reallocated by trading partner.  Ana 
to create--Rena/Diana to assist if necessary.

4)  BAI codes for activity in Citibank London :  Laurel and Phyllis to 
contact Brian Silver and Lisa Raye

5)  EURO account--items sent back from the bank and posted in USD 
equivalents.  Treasury has been notified and is researching.  Laurel & 
Phyllis to follow up.

6)  ""Not to be posted"" cash.  This causes problems with Cash Application, and 
receivables.  Phyllis/Rena to follow up with Brian Silver & Lori Scott

7)  Autoclear Inflo account--Rena to talk with Becky Ford about putting this 
on as a scheduled overnight job.

8)  Outflow account--Laurel, Cynthia, and Phyllis to continue researching 
outstanding items.  

9)  Yen--Brian Silver & Lori Scott.  Need a solution quickly, as JPY activity 
is increasing--we just had a trader move over to Japan.  

I THINK I covered everything we talked about.   Please feel free to correct 
me!!

 We have had issues in the past with Canada not informing us of all of their 
Merchant investments.  For six months we chased Invasion Debt and finally 
received enough information to put it on the MPR in August (only after it was 
placed in Raptor I).  Also, about six months ago, John Lavorato asked about 
an asset called CNR Warrants that showed up on the ""hot list"" but we were 
told by Canada that they were going to sell it so they did not want it on the

Genoil (approx. 4.7 million shares).  Again, we did not know that they owned 
this investment.  We have contacted Donna Lowry about Genoil because Beau

Subject: 

Rick, Rick,

There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by excelr, acted much as trading offices. They are very 
small.
We have worked with the people in Metals to put in place extra controls so 
that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in a 
designated Trading Office own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate (get a price from a Trading Office for every deal), and some 
execute for Trading Offices (are given a range within which they can execute 
trades).

 is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
Tab 'Office Models' shows which functions are performed in which type of 
office
Tab 'Office List' shows the actual offices involved 
We propose to re-examine this methodology in 6 months' time.
Buy-in has been obtained from the cc list and the people on the ground.

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Are you both happy with this approach?
Are there any extra controls you would like to see in place?

Thanks,
Richard

Jeff Skilling mentioned today that gas volume growth in ENA was still about 
97% year on year.
I don't know how much of this is increased number of trades and how much is 
increased volume per trade.

We are currently preparing a zero-base estimate of future support costs to 
assess the benefits v costs of all projects.
Assuming that the business in Europe will develop in a similar way to 
America, but a few years behind, it would be most useful to have some more 
statistics for several years back.
Who in your team has some more statistics on numbers of trades which could 
help us?

Each of you should have already received our stack of resumes for review.  I 
am attaching an excel spreadsheet which includes the names of all the 
attendees from our General Presentation.  It is relatively sloppy, but the 
information is there.  You will be able to search by name to epedite the 
process.  I have included a column whih indicates an ""*"" asterisk to let you 
know that particular candidate was targeted by our team members at the event, 
or that the candidate has sent a follow-up e-mail to me expressing interest.  

I hope this helps.  I know the turn-around time is far too quick, but please 
have the decisions back to Donna by noon tomorrow.

Let me know if I can help in any other way.

29460,beck-s/discussion_threads/1680.,<21218421.1075855848721.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Too late with your spreadsheet.  The instructions that we got from Donna were 
that I should review the resumes, pass them to Brent for his review, and then 
on to Causey for his review.  Considering our schedules and the large number 
of resumes to review, that would have been an impossible task to complete by 
Thursday at noon.  I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday, just before 
leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma.  I asked Patti to 
make a copy of the packet for Brent, and I knew that Rick would not want to 
take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening 
first.  I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way 
back to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of 
the business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training 
class.  We got those to Rick today by noon, as he was leaving the office.  I 
believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will 
pass the resumes along to you.  Since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this 
morning after Brent and I had done our reviews, you will have to 
cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.  

Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the 
resumes as well.  I would suggest that in the future that your team should 
make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the 
review.  The plan of passing them from one person to another is not 
practical,  and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.  If you 
are going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time 
frame, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.  If someone from 
you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that 
would have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes.  
Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes 
of MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not 
Analysts interviews.  Please give us organized information to react to, not 
simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.  All of us want to 
participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process, but 
we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and 
organizational work.  

I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program 
and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role, not being 
critical.  I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.   

Brent and I (and I am sure Hunter, too) would have appreciated ",Non Abusive

After we have mastered that here in Houston over the next month or so, I plan 
to share the format with London so that all of our wholesale businesses can 
use the same format.  

In addition to these monthly operating reports, we are working on a daily 
report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track 
compliance with our fundamental operating standards.  We are in the phase of 
determining the source of reporting (systematic or manual) and the frequency 
of reporting (daily, weekly, monthly) for all commodities and locations 
against the operating standards.  As we get this to a first draft stage, I 
will share this with you, as well as the timeline for full implementation.

Rick - You had asked a while back for a matrix that captures all of the 
different systems used by commodity, by office and by functional group.  This 
(draft) version encompasses Houston and London activities.  We will expand 
this document to include other offices and products in the next few months.  
Let me know your questions and comments.

Willie,

Per our earlier conversation, can you or Audrey or Bryce, please give further 
explain to me as to why the funds were wired to Perry Gas for purchases from 
the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales.  
You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty's that net on

Thank you,

29477,beck-s/discussion_threads/1696.,<18555335.1075855849127.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"The cause of this was the timing of when SAP went down.  SAP had a major 
system crash the day Willie finaled his supply verification in Unify.  Before 
Willie went into SAP to net the payable (same day), SAP crashed.  By the time 
SAP came up, the treasury run had already picked up the payable and wired the 
cash.  When we issued the recall, the money was already out the door.

As a result, we put a policy in place that all supply verifications for 
netout customers must be overridden as soon as they are finaled in Unify.  
This causes them to be blocked in SAP and not picked up by treasury until the 
payment block is removed.  This policy went into effect at the beginning of 
September.  

However, this still relies on human intervention to ensure the procedure 
works.  To ensure we don't ""accidentally"" release cash, I have asked Unify IT 
to change the interface to send all purchases for ENA to SAP blocked, which 
will require the coordinator to release funds.  This is an added step, but is 
worth it considering the stakes.  This change will go into effect on Monday, 
9/25.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

database, we have been working to present the data in compelling ways.  We 
have started to do this by creating the VaR Limit Usage graphs and the 
Sharpe, Rovar, and Risk - Return graphs.  

I am sorry for the misunderstanding with Ted concerning the latter.  I had 
explained what I wanted to produce in an e-mail and during a Risk Forum 
Luncheon.  Therefore, Shona and I did not expect the reaction we got.  I have 
talked to Naveen and Rudi since then, and we have changed the graphs to be 
agreeable to RAC.

Today I worked on the graphs below.  They show the P&L decomposition for the 
month (rolling 20 business days) up to 9/20 (one in dollar terms and the 
other as a percentage of P&L).  I showed them to Shona, and she thought you 
should see them before Naveen, Rudi, and Ted, because these graphs are very 
powerful and are likely to be controversial.  The graphs show that European 
Gas and UK Power released a lot of prudency.  Half of total P&L for European 
Gas is prudency, and UK Power would have had a loss of about $20 million 
(instead of a gain of $27 million) were it not for prudency.   In the case of 
North American Gas, $46 million gain in new deals partly offset about $106 
million in trading losses.  

Please note that these are rough drafts intended to show what we can do.  I 
do not think that there are problems with the data, but I threw these 
together today, and I have not yet double-checked the accuracy of my 
aggregating calculations.

Please launch the attached spreadsheet, and feel free to call or page me with 
questions or concerns.

I have thought more about Heidi Mason and Jan-Erland and think that they 
should be included.  While they do roll into Europe and also have a tie to 
accounting, they are the individuals in Sydney and Toyko that we are 
depending on to stress and enforce controls.  Heidi particularly does have 
active responsibility for risk, confirmations and settlements on a day-to-day 
basis.  And in addtion to their role reporting in to Europe, we are looking 
to them to oversee controls for other non-EEL traded commodities in their 
locations - weather, coal, etc.

I will include Fernley on the invitation list, as I had mentioned the meeting

hard. I imagine David is starting to feel a little cocky, given we should be
undefeated going into Texas, but he may still need to seek the shelter of
the study, as I know Texas is not going to roll over and play dead.

Sounds like Meagan has a full agenda this Fall and a trip to Norman would
only get in the way. I'm sure David will not let the fire die, if she is
truly interested in OU. FYI, OU's Spring Break is March 17-25 next year. So
you can plan accordingly. Let me know if you decide when you decide to come
up and I can get you lined up with Prospective Student Services for a tour.
Also, I remember you telling me about your concerns about grades. I know
that OU requires a 24 on the ACT, or finish in the top 1/3 of your
graduating class. It is my understanding that will soon be increasing to 26
or top 30% of graduating class. Looks like OU is following UT on tightening
entrance requirements.

I can get you shirts caps, sweatshirts, etc. for OU, UT and Tech. You can go
to Bigtimesports.com and look at the styles. I think they are also in the
school colors. If you see a style you like, let me know the size shape and
school and I can order it. If some of it is for you, let me know, as they
have different styles for women. Also, I can have logo's etc. reduced (like
I did on your Bevo on your shirt) so they are not so big. I always have them
reduce the OU from 1 3/4"" to a
1 1/4"" size, so I don't look like a ""poster boy"" for OU. Anyway, let me know
and I will order them for you.

Let me know when you hear back from Lexi about your discussion relative to
summer internship recruiting.

Thanks for looking into the OU/Texas tickets for us.  With the ages of the
kids, I think that we will pass on those single tickets.  The kids love our
home tradition for the game, and weren't sure that they wanted to give that
up. (I have cake pans in the shape of the state of Texas and the state of
Oklahoma - one daugther decorates one, and the other decorates the second
cake - add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate
party!)

We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on
that last game of the season. However, Klein High School has started the
football season very strongly, winning all games to date.  That means that
we may be headed for high school playoffs again this year.  Meagan is on
the drill team and must be at all games.  Last year, we played right up to
Thanksgiving in the playoffs.  So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the
spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with
Meagan.

We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.  Do you
have a list of what is available for those schools?

Thanks for the nice words. I hope excelr will be able to look at some
students for summer internships, as I am sure they will be gone by Spring.

As far as Texas tickets go, I can come up with 5 singles, but not 5
together
or even 3 and 2. Let me know if interested and I will try to get them.
Might
be able to trade up or something.

Let me know what other schools you are talking about and I can find out for
you.

Again, thank you for taking time out your schedule to come up and be a part

It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week.  As always, I
appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards.
I am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody
and Nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table.  You have
done a great job in changing and promoting the program.

I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer
interns ASAP.  I have also left Mike McConnell a message to make him aware
of the issue.  I should be able to get back with you next week, hopefully
with a change in our strategy!

If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets, please let me know.  We
will certainly purchase them, I just made the assumption that all tickets
may already be sold.

On another note, David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of
compliments.  He has a number of people that have asked him about school
shirts, caps, etc.  Do you have a list of the schools that you can get
merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get?  Let me know
-- we can probably place a few orders through you!

I am asking my assistant, Lauren to set up a video conference to discuss the 
support services that excelr Europe is providing and how we
should move forward to make these more responsive to your needs, as well as 
more efficient.   We will have a number of classic ""centralized versus 
decentralized"" matters to resolve and I doubt if one size will fit all.  Keep 
in mind that we have no desire to expand our empire.  In fact, from our 
perspective if our non-commerical headcount got smaller it would be a great 
outcome.  But the way it is has been going lately, we have been adding 
non-commerical headcount at a record pace at the same time that each of us is 
trying to massively expand our commercial business.  

We put a freeze on non-commerical hires earlier this week while we try and 
assess our space limitations and plan for the 2001 budge, so this is 
important that we get your perspective soon on what will work for you.

Global Markets has already moved some of these services under Brent Price in 
Houston but there are many other services which we need to consider as well 
such as:
IT development
IT infrastructure
RAC
Credit
Risk Management
Legal
Accounts Payable
Tax
Building Services
Analyst & Associate recruiting
Senior recruiting
Expat services
Other HR
PR
Governmental Relations
SFA relations
Finance

I hate to think that we will need to form a committee to work this issue, but 
that is a possibility.  If you have any suggestions for a process for working
these issues through, please send them out to this group or bring them to our 
upcoming meeting.

29491,beck-s/discussion_threads/1709.,<17754803.1075855849424.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message and the means of delivery.  On the means of delivery, I 
am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.  Is 
there an article to be included in an excelr publication and in addition a 
letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be 
sent)?  Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead 
in to the article?  

With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure excelr top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
excelr to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally

Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts 
on the cover note ?  

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message ( it is a European note )and the means of delivery.  On 
the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully 
understand the intent.  Is there an article to be included in an excelr 
publication ( yes )and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if 
so, to whom will the letter be sent)?  Or is the letter from John an 
introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?  ( Yes - apologies 
if there is confusion )

With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure excelr top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
excelr to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  
Agreed - but the note was targeted at Europe - would welcome the opportunity 
to work on this with you and Shona )

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  Can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to 
Shona

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times

with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave

Subject: Global Standards - additional info

I've received some feedback from some of you concerning the depth of the 
global standards as attached.  These standards are meant to represent basic, 
high level standards that each office must adhere to.  Additionally, these 
standards are applicable to each and every business excelr has.  They are not 
meant to be an exhaustive list of all excelr standards. 

I believe that each of you will have additional standards for which you would 
like to establish exception reporting that are focused to your individual 
business.  We can certainly discuss these, and possibly incorporate them as 
additional standards once these basics are addressed (a possible ""phase II"").

I'm in London this week and you can reach me at 44 777 528 3633 if you want 
to discuss this with me.

Thanks,

Shona



As I discussed in the staff meeting, I am sending you the global standards 
for your review and comment.  Please review these standards to determine if:

The targets set are reasonable for your business and
As minimum standards, they are comprehensive enough (if you would like to see 
additional reporting)

Lastly, in the upcoming month we will start to implement exception reporting 
for these standards.  Please let us know who the key contact in your 
department would be for this implementation.

Please address all correspondence to Michael Moscoso.

Thank you,

Shona

recently, one in Dallas and one in San Antonio.  We have been making the 
Texas circuit -- not quite as exciting as your travels.  

I have heard from Stephanie, and she, Paul and Rebecca are headed to Texas at 
the end of October/beginning of November.  She will be interviewing students 
at UT on October 30 and 31 and then she and her family will be in Houston 
from Wesneday, November 1 to Saturday, November 4.  They will be staying with 
us at our house.  It will be fun to watch Tyler and Rebecca get to know one 
another!  She is an older woman, but I am sure that they do well.  By the 
way, Stephanie is expecting baby number two -- I think that when she is here 
she will be about six months pregnant.  

I thought that I would let you know what her travel plans are on the off 
chance that you might be in Houston at that time.  It would be fun for all of 
us to get together.  I don't know if I had told you, but Chuck Randall has 
joined excelr and this week I saw another old First City banker, Jeff Baker, 
who was on his first day here.  We could also schedule a First City reunion 
if you could be here.  If it doesn't work this time, just let me know the 
next time you will be in Houston and I will round up all the usual suspects 
for a lunch or happy hour.  

I may need to head to London in October or November.  I will let you know if 
my travel plans develop.  

I hear from Beth that you have taken a very adventurous vacation -- mountain 
climbing!!!!!!!  How was it?  I will be anxious to hear.  --Sally

This memo apparently was already out on e:mail when we were meeting in my 
office regarding confirmations.  The language regarding Jeff's role on 
financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo.  It wasn't  
clear to me when we met whether Scott and Leslie had talked while looking at 
a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on e:mail.  Since you said 
that you had not seen this memo, please follow up with Scott, Leslie and Jeff 
to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and 
settlements so that can be communicated within the organization.  There 
should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms 
and settlements.  This memo as sent will create that confusion.  Thanks.

Controller forum set for October 22, 23 and 24.  I want to send the official 
invitation early next week.  I have conferred with Mike on attendees from 
EEL.   Since I do not know all of the reporting relationships in London, I 
did want to share this list with you and get your input as well before it is 
finalized.  Please let me know your thoughts on attendees per the attached.  

Mike was not sure that you would want to be included, but I certainly want to 
invite you and would very much welcome your attendance.  If you can come, I 
would be great for you to address the group if you would like to do so.  Just 
let me know.  Jeff Skilling, Rick Causey, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford are 
confirmed as speakers, and I am waiting to hear from Mark Frevert on his 
participation.  I expect to sent a preliminary agenda out for review next 
week as well, and would welcome your comments on that.  

Hope you have a great weekend.  --Sally

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by excelr during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of excelr attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide

Hope you are well, and enjoyed the weekend.  It was much too short for us!!  

I was wondering what the next steps are in terms of formalizing the role that 
you and I discussed in San Antonio.

As Fernley gets closer and closer to nailing my replacement, I am feeling 
more and more exposed.

As much as Rick and others have told me not to worry, it would be nice to 
nail it down.

I really do think that I would benefit greatly from more of a middle office 
focus, and have the management skills to supervise a large team of people.  I 
know I would bring a new perspective to the role, coming from more of a back 
office focus, and after my European experience know how to focus on key 
controls.



Do I need to do anything?    I have discussed February departure timing with 
Fernley and he is fine with it.  Depending upon my replacement, it could be 
sooner.

I would need a few weeks to get things wrapped up in London like moving and 
packing etc.  and re-established in Houston  -- need to buy cars etc.

but otherwise there shouldn't be too much downtime between places.

Glad to discuss at any time  x830 6639

at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with excelr, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on excelr's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
excelr by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that excelr is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which excelr recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the excelr message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for excelr extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many excelr participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.  ",Non Abusive

Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly 
to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as 
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very 
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that 
you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you 
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that 
momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most 
don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I 
have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we 
wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to 
accomplish with their guidelines.

Please keep me up informed on this matter.

Thanks and good luck with the students.

Thanks for the e-mail regarding summer interns.  I apologize that Lexi and=
=20
Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking.  I wis=
h=20
that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin=
g=20
difficulty.  I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was=
=20
available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any=
=20
member of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to=
=20
explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set =
it.

You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20
permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As=
=20
you are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting=
=20
firm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark=
et=20
research projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20
required much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20
shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10=
=20
years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm=
s,=20
begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20
actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns=
=20
until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,=
=20
Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first=
=20
year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui=
t=20
in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for=
=20
""spring"" internships.

The recruiting strategy at excelr is no different this year than it was last=
=20
year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &=
=20
February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that=
=20
did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope=
. =20
We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20
because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.

Utilizing this strategy did not impair excelr=01,s ability to hire quality s=
ummer=20
interns.  This past summer excelr had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and=
=20
40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20
summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20
assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20
offers to join excelr.  =20

The reason excelr has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20
summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20
undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20
particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms=
=20
that Jeff Skilling identifies as excelr's competitors.  Because the=20
undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20
continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the=
re=20
were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).

With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about=
=20
which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y=
ou=20
indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve=
r,=20
provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken=
=20
therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.

While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained=
=20
from UT.

o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20
o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on=
=20
campus conduct interviews in the fall for ""summer"" internships.  Cindy=20
attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring=
,=20
or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct=
=20
all interviews  at one time. =20
o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting =
on=20
campus recruit in the spring for summer internships.

We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t=
he=20
statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such=
=20
information. =20

It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20
different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20
individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for=
=20
the discrepancies.

While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20
different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie=
ve=20
that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20
supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20
already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview=
=20
process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in=
=20
most instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by=
=20
the respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would=

like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this=

Sally,

Thanks for the e-mail regarding summer interns.  I apologize that Lexi and=
=20
Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking.  I wis=
h=20
that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin=
g=20
difficulty.  I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was=
=20
available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any=
=20
member of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to=
=20
explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set =
it.

You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20
permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As=
=20
you are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting=
=20
firm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark=
et=20
research projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20
required much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20
shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10=
=20
years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm=
s,=20
begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20
actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns=
=20
until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,=
=20
Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first=
=20
year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui=
t=20
in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for=
=20
""spring"" internships.

The recruiting strategy at excelr is no different this year than it was last=
=20
year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &=
=20
February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that=
=20
did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope=
. =20
We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20
because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.

Utilizing this strategy did not impair excelr=01,s ability to hire quality s=
ummer=20
interns.  This past summer excelr had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and=
=20
40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20
summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20
assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20
offers to join excelr.  =20

The reason excelr has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20
summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20
undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20
particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms=
=20
that Jeff Skilling identifies as excelr's competitors.  Because the=20
undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20
continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the=
re=20
were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).

With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about=
=20
which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y=
ou=20
indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve=
r,=20
provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken=
=20
therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.

While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained=
=20
from UT.

o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20
o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on=
=20
campus conduct interviews in the fall for ""summer"" internships.  Cindy=20
attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring=
,=20
or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct=
=20
all interviews  at one time. =20
o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting =
on=20
campus recruit in the spring for summer internships.

We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t=
he=20
statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such=
=20
information. =20

It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20
different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20
individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for=
=20
the discrepancies.

While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20
different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie=
ve=20
that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20
supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20
already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview=
=20
process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in=
=20
most instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by=
=20
the respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would=
=20
like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this=
=20
fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to=

I hope this has been helpful.  I can understand and appreciate your=20

Sally,

Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly 
to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as 
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very 
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that 
you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you 
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that 
momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most 
don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I 
have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we 
wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to 
accomplish with their guidelines.

Please keep me up informed on this matter.

Thanks and good luck with the students.

Subject: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns


While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with excelr, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on excelr's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
excelr by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that excelr is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which excelr recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the excelr message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for excelr extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many excelr participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.

Relationship Management practice of Deloitte Consulting.? His experience 
demonstrates a broad range of technical and business expertise working for 
clients such as the State of California, Puget Sound Energy and Kaiser 
Permanente.? Zach also played an integral role in the international 
e-commerce project based in Switzerland.

Zach is interested in finding a position which will enable him to leverage

I may have already sent this to you.  It is a process flow for how we should 
structure, execute, and follow up findings.  Let me know if you have any 
changes.  I've already given it to Donna, Cassandra, and Lynn Bellinghausen 
as a draft.

Also, just to let you know, the schedule is still being revised.  The latest 
version is with Cassandra.  I'll send you a new copy once they've revised 
it.  It will then goto Lynn's group.

Subject: EnFORM Proposal and Resumes

Dan and Tom,
As we discussed, I am aggressively seeking well qualified top talent 
permanent and contract personnel for both Commodity Logic and Deal Bench.  We 
have specified our requirement for specialized technical experience 
(WebLogic, Java, JSP, HTML) and we are receiving many promising resumes in 
response.  We talked with Andersen Consulting, PriceWarterhouse, Enform, 
Valtech, Common Vision, Delinea, etc. and we made it clear that we want them 
to augment our permanent staff rather than doing a turn-key operation to 
which they have all agreed.

Attached are some of the preliminary resumes and fee schedules from EnFORM, 
we expect many others to be in approximately same range of rates.  If you 
have any questions, please let me know.
      Thanks,
      Inja

Inja and John,
Again, it was a pleasure meeting with you yesterday.  As promised, I am
sending the resumes of candidate architects and developers along with a
short proposal for your review.   I also included the resumes of a few very
capable Junior Developers in case you see a need for additional horsepower
at a very low rate.   If possible, I would like to stop by for a short 10-15
minute meeting with you on Monday so I can deliver a hard copy and then walk
you through our proposal.

As you can imagine, we are very interested in working with excelr so we have
given you the selection of our best folks and we have priced these
individuals very aggressively.  I look forward to working with you in the
near future.

Thank you for volunteering some of your leads to work with us on the upcoming 
Doorstep reviews.  I have spoken with Sally and we think that in principle it 
is a good idea to get your people involved on a world-wide basis - the more 
resources we can use the better!

I have put together a schedule for Q4 00 - Q4 01 and would like to receive 
proposed names from you allocated to individual doorstep reviews. 

Attached is the latest draft of the Doorstep schedule.  Please let me know by 
next Tuesday if there are Risk Operations spots you may be able to fill (any 
with whom).  Also, as you are responsible for ensuring that the excelr Europe 
(with the exception of London) doorsteps are performed, please let me know 
which individuals you plan to allocate to these reviews.

Thanks,

I have obtained a copy of all reports currently being prepared.  In the

Yesterday, I received a call out of the blue from Greg Hermans who will be 
heading up the steel trading efforts for EIM.  He wanted me to come right up 
and talk to them about excelrOnline and how to get their products on the web.  
So, of course, we responded immediately and met with them for about an hour 
on what they want to do.  I knew we were going to start trading steel, but 
had not heard from Dave that we were going to do this online.  So, I sent 
Andy and Dave the message below detailing the discussion and asked for 
thoughts/concerns going forward.  This will not require any technical 
changes, enhancements, etc., and should be very easy for us to handle....  I 
received the responses below from Dave, and sent him my response.  I am not 
sure if he is upset that they called me instead of him, but there is no 
reason that I should not have the authority to take care of these things.  
And the intention was to inform them both in case they did have concerns.

I am on vacation beginning this afternoon, and will return on Monday (I am 
going to send out a note as you suggested in the past before I leave).

Jayshree approached me on behalf of Greg, Jason and Sean about two weeks ago 
to set up a meeting. I informed her at that time that we were in the throes 
of Phase 2 launch and that we were focussed on their LME products and that we 
should meet after Phase 2.

I have also exchanged voice mails on same with Sean and have had recent 
discussions with Bruce Garner on Steel, excelr Network Partners and excelr 
Metals and the relationship between them.

As you know, Amita has worldwide responsibility for metals on excelrOnline. 
Although the Steel group is under separate ownership from Aluminum and 
Copper, there is obviously a degree of overlap.

It is important that the Steel launch is coordinated with our other metals 
activities and that all the usual bases are covered (Marketing launch 
processes, commercial review of contracts, products and structure, regulatory 
compliance, application training, etc.).

I am planning to meet Greg and Sean next week in Houston to discuss the 
above, their launch timetable and coordination with an expressed desire to 
create an excelr Steel vertical.

Please do not do anything further until I have had an opportunity to meet 
Greg and Sean and have assigned someone to take responsibility for 
coordinating all of the launch elements and to act as a central point of 
contact.

Andy-

We (Jennifer, Rob and I) just met with Greg Hermans who will be heading up 
the steel trading group here in the U.S (Jason Seigal and Sean Keenan were 
also present).  They want to start trading asap - we gathered all the initial 
information we would need to get the product type set up.  Here are the facts:

Financial products only (but he wants to offer physical products in the near 
future.  The issue is that back office logistics systems to physically move 
the product do not exist  - the same challenge the paper guys have).
We are not trading this product OTC yet
The GTC's and long descriptions are in draft format.  Harry Collins (Legal) 
is working on - Rob Cass has already talked to Harry and I think we are close 
on this
The key customer list consists of approx. 50 customers (450 additional) - we 
requested this by Friday so that Credit can get started.  I will send a note 
to Debbie Brackett tonight.  As you can imagine, most of these are customers 
we are not currently doing business with, and the steel industry has not been 
the most profitable the last few years, so I am not sure how many of these 
will even get approved.
Back office systems - they have not decided what they are going to use yet -  
Sitara, TAGG or some other system (really irrelevant for you, but we will 
bridge to whatever system they choose if the number of transactions warrant 
this)
They have not determined which index/publication they will use (most likely 
something called Metal Bulletin)
The first two product types will be Hot Rolled and Cold Rolled
All products will be offered in USD
We need to determine if the products will be offered by EIM or ENA - I am 
fairly sure it will be ENA, but we are discussing with legal.  Greg was not 
sure...


This may not be news to you, but just in case, I wanted to make sure you were 
in the loop.   Please let me know if you have any thoughts/concerns.

Thanks

Thanks for the update.  I appreciate your input as I do not know what your 
discussions with Rick Buy have been.  To address your points below:

1)  I agree that your team should be involved in the planning of each 
individual review although I am under the impression that Ted & Sally (by 
proxy Cassandra and I) would set the scope & timing of the reviews while your 
group would be looped in to the planning for each individual process.  If my 
understanding is incorrect, please let me know.  

2) I agree that it would be useful for everyone to attend all meetings.  
However, due to the limited time we have from arriving at the doorstep to 
delivery of the report to Ted and Sally, your group really has to be focused 
on completing the deal test.    We don't need three different people 
obtaining the same information at the same meetings.  If there has been a 
change in your group's role from what I originally understood (we need lower 
level people from your team who would be able to execute a deal test) , we 
may have to add additional resources to do the actual deal test to ensure it 
is done on time (by the time we leave the site). 

3)  Agreed - I'd like to hear what Donna and Mike Neeves have resolved as far 
as the database is concerned before we meet again.

Inja,

Per the conference call today I am confident that we can add value to the
Commodity Logic Project. I base this on the success of excelr Online and
Valtech's role of supporting that effort. Currently, We have the Architect
(David Jayakaran) that designed the presentation framework for EOL available
as part of the team. I mention this because of the obvious synergy between
the EOL framework and Commodity Logic. As discussed David will meet with you
on Wednesday. The action items I owe you are the excelr negotiated rate
structure and profiles for consultants that could start immediately. The
daily rates are senior consultants at $2,000 and consultants at $1,750.  The
profiles are attached for your review. Please contact me if you have any
questions.

Regards,

Martin

Wanted to apologize for the way I probably sounded on the phone--lots was

Thanks for sending the excelr article--thought it was great--brought it in to

Pictures of the girls were much appreciated--can't really believe how old
they look.  Brigeda's has taken possession of them and put them on her
bulletin board--although she wanted BIGGER ones like Grandmom--told her
Grandmoms always got bigger ones....Brigeda gets her picture taken next week
and will send you one--last year's was so dorky we didn't circulate them

Dad actually seemed better yesterday.  He was making jokes and his voice was
a little stronger--he's on pain medication for his tongue--I think giving
him something to make him relax really does help--he wasn't loopy just not
quite so tense.   He seemed very ""up"" for the dr's appt in Houston.  I told
him you asked Fabe for the best ENT in Houston and that this guy was in your
church and did Meagan's tonsils.  He liked all of that information a
lot...thanks again for arranging this.  Mom and I decided if anyone could
get him to a doctor on short notice you would be able to do it--now the
pressure is on!

Hope you have a great weekend--Brigeda and I are looking forward to see you
guys next weekend.

If you recall, several months ago we held a meeting to discuss the bonus 
planning needs for Commercial and Commercial Support Analysts now that they 
have been combined into one program under the A/A Program umbrella.

I was asked to put together some information on how bonuses in 1999 compared 
between Merchant Service Analysts, Commercial Analysts and Commercial Support 
Sr. Specialists (and possibly even Managers) so that we could determine if 
there would be a 2000 bonus compression problem in Analysts being placed in 
Commercial Support positions and then having lower bonuses.  Attached below 
you will find the results of that research.

In short the conclusions are these:
The 2000 system allows a difference between Commercial and Commercial Support 
Analyst bonus matrices preventing the compression problem.
In 1999, Commercial Analyst and Commercial Support Sr. Specialist bonus 
matrices were comparable - and this can still occur in 2000.
Bonus structures can easily be planned for 2000 so that no compression 
problem occurs.



The data above is being sent to help you understand the concepts we discussed 
and put closure to the meeting.  The 2000 bonus planning system allows for a 
variation within Analyst categories (commercial and commercial support) and 
will meet the business needs.  Please let me know if you want to discuss 
further or would like to see the raw data used in the research.

Subject: Re: RAC Feeds 29-Sep  

Debbie,

For UK Power, this was not officialised because we had a curve shift for 25+ 
years which was made in error. For the DPR we put a 'top side' adjustment 
through but because of the time it would take to re calc no re calc was 
performed. This should have been covered in the daily conference call. Was it 
?

For UK Gas, I thought this issue was closed on the conference call. We used 
the 30th as our month end as a result of the way the month end fell. The guys 
have now clicked the 'officialised' button for the 29th if it helps you, but 
we did not use that data (there shouldn't be anything materially wrong with 
it though).

What I think this highlights is that we will have days where we do not 
officialise and do not re run. In these circumstances we will put a top side 
through. We therefore need a mechanism to communicate this top side and I 
would request we get this in place as soon as possible (this has been 
requested a few times before).

Does this answer your questions ?

James

We are making a real effort here to understand why the Risk Controls groups

There is an MTM for the 29-Sep but is has not been approved. However, there

office), I wanted to close the loop on some of the discussions we've all been 
having on Doorstep.  After talking with Rick Carson,  Shona and I see several 
alternatives:

Our Needs:
1) Database Management
2) Staff to do the deal test and write the report

No matter what, we want to use Rick Carson's group to maintain the Doorstep 
database.  

Our Goals:
The one open question we need to resolve is whether or not Rick Buy does in 
fact want Rick Carson's group to develop trading expertise with the goal of 
being able to do Doorstep visits alone without the involvement of Market Risk 
Management (MRM) or Sally's (Ops) group.  Rick Carson indicated that was his 
understanding from talking to Rick Buy.  If that is the case, we should 
select alternative #1 below, despite the inefficiencies.

If we are simply trying to carry out the Doorstep initiative in the most 
efficient manner possible, it seems Carson's involvement is not actually the 
way to get there.

Alternatives:
1)  Include Rick Carson's group to staff the deal test while including them 
in planning, interviews, etc. 
  - RC does not have low level people to do deal test only; his people are 
experienced managers/directors who would only
  be interested in participating if they were learning the trading business; 
it is also a management problem for his staff to be
  under someone else's direction so he wants their more active involvement

  Pros: - inclusion in interviews might shorten turn around time for them 
documenting the findings in the report
   - training of a RC's group - is this in fact a goal?
   
  Cons: - no real need for a 3rd level of ""brains"" - we just need brawn
   -involvement by 3 or more people in interviews might be intimidating to 
target personnel, may be inefficient, etc.
   - planning and oversight with 3 groups ""in charge"" is inefficient and 
could cause accountability question

2) Don't use Rick Carson's group except for database management: Instead, 
consider one of the following:
 A) Have the MRM and Ops people assigned to the Doorstep do the deal test and 
write the report; bring a staff level person from MRM or Ops to
  do the deal test
   
  Pros: Efficient, keeps expertise and training within our two groups who can 
benefit most directly as trading is our focus (vs. Carson's group), no
   issue with managing staff, etc.; 

  Issue: Do our two groups (MRM and Ops) have resources necessary to devote? 

 B) Outsource to AA

  Cons: Little leverage on timeliness of report, not developing in house 
expertise, expensive, 


 C) See if there are other internal resources like the Business Risk 
Management / Energy Assurance Services group (Internal Audit), or 
accountants   from Causey's other groups, etc.


Assuming Buy does  not actually plan to transfer responsbility for Doorstep 
to Carson's group, I think Shona and I are leaning toward 2A  - it depends on 
what you two think about it - I think our staff level people would welcome 
the opportunity to participate and see other offices - the question is can we 
afford time wise for them to do so.  But if we want to train Carson's group 
with the idea of them eventually becoming the primary RAC Doorstep interface, 
we can do that instead.

Let us know what you think so we can finalize our staffing plans.

Good.  It is nice to get a recap of what's going on.

A few comments....

1) Can I see the OPM vision document?

2) MKM Phase I - what's included?  what's the business benefit?

3) MKM - Decommisioning of Phoenix.  I think you might be getting a little 
ahead of yourself here.  First you will need to integrate MKM with EnPower, 
Unify, and Sitara.  What are the plans for that?  I also think the delay in 
the Calculation component could be a problem.  For instance, we currently use 
spreadsheets to calculate the average prices and then key them into Unify 
(maybe Phoenix).  We do this because we don't have the ability to key 
anything into either Phoenix or MKM.  How will we do this if Phoenix goes 
away?  I want to make sure the process is thoroughly thought through here.

4) MKM - Support of both Phoenix and LIM is a duplication of efforts and 
costly.....   The plans here need to go back to the vision.  Where is the 
step by step plan of getting to the vision?

5) GRS Support - The most important interim priority is not reflected here 
which concerns me.  Because Reuters accuracy is so poor, the most critical 
thing we need is the ability to select an alternate source for pricing, such 
as CQG, for the downloads!

6) GRS Support - OPIS validation.  This is a business issue and I'm not sure 
this should be reflected in your status report, but you do need to make sure 
Steve gets on this.


Clearly from this, I think good coordination and project management is still 
lacking in the Rates/MKM world.  Is Stuart calling the shots (Phoenix 
decommisioning) or are we?

Jeff, 
I spoke with Todd Burke regarding a retention strategy for the managers we 
talked about.   He told me that he would make a recommendation after he 
completes the pay practices survery by Mid-November in order to accurately 
compensate them.   He is concerned that we may present an inaccurate plan for 
retention without market data. 
If this is a very urgent issue for you please let us know.   If you suspect 
that the managers are being made offers then please let us know.

I'll be there, and look forward to the event.

Is there an agenda, I wonder when it all starts on the Sunday. I plan to fly 
out on the Sunday, and go back on Thursday morning, so I can spend a few days

teams, two of the seven teams that I introduced at the conference in San

at the Crown Plaza Hotel, 2222 West Loop South.  This is an important next 
step in completing the SAP implementation and achieving the benefits that we 
identified before Project Apollo and Beyond began. 

The objectives of this meeting will be 1) to identify management's 
information needs and priorities related to the accounting and reporting 
processes and 2) to prioritize and focus the efforts of the Process 
Leveraging and Reporting teams based on management's needs and priorities.  
Therefore, it is very important for you to attend, to ensure that your BU's 
needs and priorities are considered in these projects.  I realize that this 
is a very busy time, but it will probably continue to be busy through yearend 
close.  If we can get started as soon as possible, it is my hope that we can 
complete the projects and see the results soon, possibly by the January close.

Attached is a list of questions and other information that you should 
assemble and bring with you to the meeting so that we can make 
better-informed decisions.  We will collect your completed information sheets 
to use for further analysis and follow-up after the meeting.  If you have 
questions in completing the pre-work items, please contact Jan Johnson at 
x33260. 

A preliminary agenda is also attached.   Please plan to attend the entire 
day, as individual segments of the agenda will not make sense without full 
participation

Please RSVP to Dortha Gray (x35903) by tomorrow at 2pm.  A continental 
breakfast and buffet lunch will be provided.  If you are unable to attend, 
let me know who will represent you.  Thanks for your help.

We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to 
take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is (we will need 
to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely):-

Aims
Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support 
teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams.
A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive 
on-going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking.
Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully 
leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused 
by it
All elements of implementing, completing and reviewing internal control 
should generate defined output
We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and 
origination controls (we have defined the control structure for trading 
offices, agency offices and origination offices and we must police our 
labelling for each office)
The output from excelr's perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be 
discussed at control/governance meetings (eg at Sally/Ted/Fernley's level and 
at the audit committee level) - the important issue here is that every list 
must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have 
different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior/experienced 
staff 
The output from AA's perspective is their internal controls audit opinion 
based upon our database and our review and management process of it

Trading Process - monthly
Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction 
cycle - rating made by business controller is red, amber, green - with trend 
indicator of static, improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full 
listing
Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see 
attachment 1 (you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment 
2 - and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not 
solely drive the judgement within the self assessment) - Shona, this is the 
work that Mike Moscoso is leading
Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss 
operational risk and areas of concern (red and amber) with agreement of 
action plans for such areas
Monthly review by controller/senior controller of database where all high 
(red) and medium (amber) risk issues are recorded.  Milestones for action 
plans revisited, reconfirmed or amended
Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if 
the risk rating for any remote offices has changed
All new information on issues raised by self assessment, doorstep review or 
BRM completion populated into database
Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and 
decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment

Process - Yearly Planning
Checkpoint taken of
current operational environment (say end Oct)
proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in 
office, and
IT development plans for next year
Prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what 
depth does report need to go to.  Note the doorstep review would be an end to 
end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review 
of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the 
review effort on areas of concern, the actions plans in place and concluding 
on the 'mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level'
Prioritisation made for BRM - which functions, NOT BUSINESS UNITS, require 
external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and 
doorstep processes (could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal 
governance process?) - most likely reviews completed on functions that 
assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as FX exposure 
management, cash management, credit exposure management, IT change management 
controls/process

Where are we NOW - if we all thought to do this immediately

We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - I 
am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston 
offsite do this? 23rd Oct
The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as 
senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week Oct
We agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep 
databases - November
Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate 
the database from scratch - November
Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and 
remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to 
visit all? - November
Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning - 
end November to end December !!

Wow - lets chat about this

Thanks for your insight.  In the past few months we have established a 
detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM.  Through 
my calls the past week, I've been trying to update you so we can determine 
how best to coordinate the excelr Europe work, as well as get an understanding

Subject: Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an 
internal approach to internal audit

Shawn / Shona

We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to 
take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is (we will need 
to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely):-

Aims
Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support 
teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams.
A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive 
on-going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking.
Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully 
leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused 
by it
All elements of implementing, completing and reviewing internal control 
should generate defined output
We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and 
origination controls (we have defined the control structure for trading 
offices, agency offices and origination offices and we must police our 
labelling for each office)
The output from excelr's perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be 
discussed at control/governance meetings (eg at Sally/Ted/Fernley's level and 
at the audit committee level) - the important issue here is that every list 
must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have 
different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior/experienced 
staff 
The output from AA's perspective is their internal controls audit opinion 
based upon our database and our review and management process of it

Trading Process - monthly
Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction 
cycle - rating made by business controller is red, amber, green - with trend 
indicator of static, improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full 
listing
Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see 
attachment 1 (you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment 
2 - and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not 
solely drive the judgement within the self assessment) - Shona, this is the 
work that Mike Moscoso is leading
Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss 
operational risk and areas of concern (red and amber) with agreement of 
action plans for such areas
Monthly review by controller/senior controller of database where all high 
(red) and medium (amber) risk issues are recorded.  Milestones for action 
plans revisited, reconfirmed or amended
Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if 
the risk rating for any remote offices has changed
All new information on issues raised by self assessment, doorstep review or 
BRM completion populated into database
Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and 
decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment

Process - Yearly Planning
Checkpoint taken of
current operational environment (say end Oct)
proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in 
office, and
IT development plans for next year
Prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what 
depth does report need to go to.  Note the doorstep review would be an end to 
end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review 
of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the 
review effort on areas of concern, the actions plans in place and concluding 
on the 'mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level'
Prioritisation made for BRM - which functions, NOT BUSINESS UNITS, require 
external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and 
doorstep processes (could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal 
governance process?) - most likely reviews completed on functions that 
assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as FX exposure 
management, cash management, credit exposure management, IT change management 
controls/process

Where are we NOW - if we all thought to do this immediately

We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - I 
am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston 
offsite do this? 23rd Oct
The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as 
senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week Oct
We agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep 
databases - November
Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate 
the database from scratch - November
Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and 
remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to 
visit all? - November
Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning - 
end November to end December !!

Wow - lets chat about this

A few comments :

As discussed it may be useful to see how the doorstep and BRM approaches 
interact - anything written down that explains it ?

I am going to proceed with driving accountability for op risk assessment to 
my controllers - we should discuss at the global offsite if it is worth 
formalising this process - I am totally open to ideas on this.

Lastly, in conversations with Shawn we agreed to delay the full planning for 
European BRM 2001 whilst we finalise this years reports ( lots of activity 
due in October )

Thanks for the call yesterday

Dear Mike,

Thanks for your insight.  In the past few months we have established a 
detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM.  Through 
my calls the past week, I've been trying to update you so we can determine 
how best to coordinate the excelr Europe work, as well as get an understanding 
of what resources you can supply for this global initiative.

My next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to 
determine their skill set and what locations/commodities they'd be best to 
work on.

I'll send you an updated schedule once I've finalized this.

Hector:  The key employees that Jeff has identified are senior specialists, 
with the exception of Will Kelly.  If you remember, these are the risk 
employees that I was concerned about when Steve Jackson tendered his letter 
of resignation.  Steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor, and 
it is not inconceivable that he might approach some excelr employees to join 
him and help ensure his success with his new employer.  We don't want this to 
happen.  Waiting until the end of November to implement an effective 
retention plan does not make sense.  Please call me tomorrow and let's talk

Subject: RAC issues

Fernley

Output from a meeting with David and James on the specific issues :-

David's view is that a detailed factual list of issues is as yet not 
available but the summary is as follows :-

At present Europe is substantially hitting the two key deadlines of 
'officialisation' of the books by Risk management by 6 am Houston time and 
Summary DPR received in Houston by Noon ( indeed have internal deadlines 1 
hour before that for contingency )
However, there are some IT problems in that the feeds to Houston post 
officialisation are currently taking a number of hours - and IT are currently 
looking to rewriting feeds and purchasing a dedicated server for feeding to 
Risktrac.
Additionally, because of the time difference between the two targets and the 
fact that Risk Managament do not obtain MTM information until completion of 
the overnight batch ( ie start working first thing in morning UK time ) there 
has been scope for continuing to work on the raw MTM data. Consequently,
there is potential for Risk Management 'top siding' for corrections such that 
the summary DPR will be 'different' from the risktrac information - We do 
topsides because it is impossible, given current systems, to rerun the 
overnight batch and extract the data from the valuation systems - our p&l 
explain processes are themselves spreadsheet based.
The majority of topsides are caused by inaccurate data capture at the deal 
entry stage - itself a symptom of underinvestment in the data validation 
process of risk systems
Whilst the topside adjustment is communicated to Houston  - Risktrac requires 
a fully automated process
Whilst we should consider the materiality of the topside - RAC rightly are 
trying to implement zero tolerance - to help flag all the issues
Within the last fortnight we once received the incorrect curves on UK Power 
such that the full database was incorrectly valued - there was insufficient 
time ( for reason stated above ) to rerun and reextract and indeed today the 
batch failed because the UK Power server ran out of processing diskspace.

We are doing a reasonably good job given the significant systems inadequacies 
we face ( and that have been flagged on a continuous basis - they are on the 
long list for development ).

The recent daily taskforce meetings will provide more structured reporting of 
the root causes that will allow better escalation of systemic issues - and we 
should seek to discuss these in the context of the goal of corporate policy 
compliance ( we should recommunicate the policy internally within Europe )

questions, please let me know.


Energy Operations has experienced a 140% increase in transaction growth as a

efficient use of existing resources.  As a result the per unit cost of

We began the meeting with a review of the progress to date.   Detail 
transaction flows were discussed including the very important items, Price 
and Volume.  Both will be required daily in groupings.  The changes by day in 
the positions was stated as already being in place.   We then began to 
discuss what we needed to have and what was already present in the current 
system.  Items such as  Groups, Price, Priority, Today's Position, Change in 
Trades, etc were all mentioned as required.

The following is my version of the meeting yesterday.  I hope I captured 
everything correctly and have the proper ""to do"" list included:

We decided that we needed to provide contract details on Evergreen contracts 
and that a copy of a delivery contract  needs to be provided to the team.

A matrix was created which defined which barrel information was in the 
current system and which information was needed but not available.


                    POSITION REPORT STATUS CURRENT


BARREL INFORMATION IN THE REPORT           INFORMATION NOT IN THE REPORT


Exchange Traded barrels     Evergreen
Broker barrels (exchange contracts)   Term to Evergreen
Spot barrels (one day lag in entry)   Lease
Term barrels      Pipeline barrels
OTC        Storage barrels
Swaps        Inventory with a sale against them are
Options       the only barrels in the report



As additional tasks we stated that Tickets to Actuals need to be in the 
Report everyday.  To achieve this we need Right Angle ticket detail 
actualized daily.  We then stated that we need to develop a plan to achieve 
the above
stated needs.

We then agreed on the following:

1.  Create the step by step plan to achieve the daily information goals.
2.   We will define the information fields needed.  Lori and Yolanda will 
work with the DataBase Manager to achieve the necessary information.
3.   We will create the plan to build the analytical data mart from which 
this information will be extracted and reported.
4.  The team will consist of Bjorn Hagelmann, David Hultsman, Lori Maddox, 
Lawrence Clayton, Sheila Harris, Biaggio McPhee, Lisa Meyer, Jim Martel.

Don't worry about me -- I just thought we should get things moving -- since

anxious to put an announcement out to excelr Europe that Phillip Lord and I

Since Phillip already has a place to go, it would be nice if we could at

PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING ISSUE:

At the Audit Comittee Meeting, Jeff made the comment that the number of and 
timing of the limit notifications caused them to be meaningless.  Now part of 
that was an attempt by him to diffuse the number of notifications represented 
graphically, but I think that there is an element of truth, particularly of 
late.  therefore, I propose that we work toward making that timing faster and 
the impact more meaningful.  

I think the following might help:
1) Cassandra will be our point person, therefore it will be faster than 
waiting for the slower, more distracted and less organized ME
2) I will propose that we raise the threshholds for notifications, 
particularly at Jeff's level - I think that the sheer volume makes an 
impression on Rick. Unfortunately, I think that it will not be in effect 
until after the Dec bd meeting.  FYI I have proposed this at least twice and 
have been shot down by Greg and Rick, but now that a smart guy is proposing 
it, it will probably get more attention.
3) We should use the executive report viewer as the mechanism for delivery.  
I do not know who actually supports that thing so please let me know.
 It has been important to AA for audit purposes to see ""evidence"" that Rick, 
Jeff, Ken and Bd received appropriate notification - so that needs to be 
considered.
Another possibility would be RisktRAC.  The 3-d solution contracted for 
contains an ""Executive View"" of ""hot spots"" .  Unfortunately, even though 
Jeff requested it on his desk top 5 months ago, we can't get the IT resources 
to pay attention to it.  IT however, has been interviewed several times for 
magazines and have created such incredibly successful and useful products 
such as EnergyDesk.com, Credit.com, En-lighten, 
..............................................................................
..  

Conceptually,
Notifications should take place before trading begins the next day.  This may 
be utopian, but it is fundamentally correct (just because excelr doesn't know 
it is supposed to, doesn't make it right).  I am certain that real risk 
management organizations have a mechanism in place for this.   It  may be 
necessary to create a SWAG process that is lightning fast with a more exact 
process to follow.

Please have fixed by close of business today.

visit in September.  I forwarded the attached file to James New and Mike 
Jordan several weeks ago and had hoped to discuss it with them.  I have had 
no response and, therefore, I assume that they agree with the direction that 
was laid out in the departure meeting (Sept. 15) with Gregor, Paul, and Risk 
personnel.

The three areas addressed in the report are as follows:

Pool Book P&L Split
EnPower Structure Modification
Transmission Valuation

Pool Book P&L Split
I have spoken to Anthony MacDonald about the progress and as I understand, he 
has offered to devote time in order to inform James and Coralie Evans about 
the underlying problem.

EnPower Structure Modification
Paul can certainly give you a more detailed understanding as to the Legal 
Entity decision process and amount of rework time that is required of your 
Risk and Confirmation groups.  I have discussed this problem with Zhiyong Wei 
(Houston's EnPower support) in order to inform him of the situation and Paul 
mentioned that he has also spoken with Brian Hudson.

Transmission
As of my last communication with Houston IT, the testing was almost 
complete.  At the departure meeting mentioned above, we considered valuation 
of transmission as a spread-option to be Plan A and further agreed upon a 
Plan B and C.  The report details the operational risk involved in valuing 
transmission by using the Forwards deal type in EnPower.

Since I have communicated with James and Mike and now with the 3 of you, I 
have completed my responsibilities on this project.  We have now formalized a 
direction with backup plans and I would encourage testing by the London 
office to ensure that what meets the West Power desk's needs will also 
address yours. If you need to further discuss this report, feel free to call

Dear Paul,

Thanks for the update.  Can you liase with Al Pennisi and Marcelo Parra to 
look at the R&N information?  We are trying to get a handle on how 
comfortable we are outsourcing the majority of the middle office for the US 
brokerage business.  Not just settlements, but nearly all functions.  Al is 
putting together some information regarding R&N.  Together with Al, Kevin 
Rhodes and Marcelo we should be able to come to a recommendation (either the 
middle office operations is something we should start to do ourselves, or 
that we think it is best to continue to use R&N as an outsourcer for the 
brokerage business).

If you want to discuss call me at 713 853 9123.

Regards

Shona

Ideally I think Will Morley (recent hire to London Documentation team) should

On the Settlements side I am happy to look at the Rolfe & Nowlan side as I

Subject: OU Update

Dear OU Team:

I wanted to send a quick update regarding the rest of the fall recruiting 
season:

According to your recruiting guide, we are scheduled to host a Corporate View 
on October 19 and 20.  This has been changed to November 10.  This event will 
now be co-sponsored (in Houston) with Arthur Andersen and will also involve 
students from the Fellows group at Texas A&M.  We were given this opportunity 
through Tim Rasnic (our JC Penney Leadership contact at OU) and Dr. Tim 
Peterson (the contact for our Texas A&M recruiter).  Details will be sent to 
the group as Tim Rasnic finalizes the logistical details between the 2 groups.

Also, we will be conducting Intern Interviews October 30 and 31.  I realize 
this falls at a time when many of you are interested in being with your 
families (as would I), so please keep in mind that the greater number of 
interviewers we have for this event, the sooner we can all get back home to 
TRICK-OR-TREAT!!!  We will sort through the candidate resumes once I receive 
them from Career Services.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be able to help with 
interviews on day 1 (October 30).    
Just to update you on last week's interviews:
We will be inviting 9 candidates to Super Saturday on November 4.  I will 
send their names and contact information to you after each has been notified.

Thanks to each of you for making this season such a success!
I appreciate the time and help you have all provided!

thanks!

fyi, my comments are:

SAP interface - we discussed an improved solution for implementation in 4th 
Quarter earlier this week

Inactive Employees, etc - In the absence of a corporate process for keeping 
this updated, the Global Managers do periodically review who has access and 
request changes to access based upon their knowledge of current employee 
assignments.  At best, this is a quarterly process.

Passwords -  they are right.  We probably need something.

Stuart,

We have completed our work on the Global Systems (Counterparty, Contracts, 
Facilities, and Common Codes) in accordance with the excelr North America 2000 
Audit Plan.  We met with Sundar Chitradurga and Ravi Arumbakkam on the IT 
side and Mary Solmonson on the business side in order to gain an 
understanding of the application and its environment.  We were provided the 
documentation we requested and are pleased with the cooperation we received.  
We appreciate them making time to work with us in completing this audit.

We have closed our preliminary issues with Sundar and Ravi and we agree on 
the items in the report.  I am attaching a copy of the preliminary report for 
your review.  At excelr's request, the reporting date for the currently open 
business audits has been moved to this Friday, the 20th of October.  They 
were originally scheduled to report on the 27th.

We would like to give you an opportunity to read through this report and meet 
with us to discuss any areas of concern prior to Friday's reporting.  We are 
available today, the 18th, throughout the afternoon and all day tomorrow, 
Thursday the 19th.  I will also call you this afternoon to discuss meeting to 
go over each of these issues.  If you are comfortable with this report and do 
not feel it is necessary for us to meet and discuss it, please let me know.  
After we have agreed on the accuracy of all issues, they will be placed in 
the final reporting format.  We will provide you a copy of the final report 
when it is completed.

We appreciate your cooperation and efforts in this regard.

Thanks,

Russ Bouwhuis

so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key speaking points that would enforce 
the value of this conference for this group would be:

recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 
2000 

the value you place on the jobs performed by operations controllers to ensure 
integrity in mid and back office functions

the importance of tight operational controls in enabling business growth for 
excelr (your loose/tight analogy would be great, as many have not heard that) 

the independent control role that we play and our responsibility to ""raise

Here are a few tips that will immediately improve the time it takes to make a 
offer to your candidates.   

All applicants must fill out and sign an Application and a Fair Credit 
Reporting Act form (included with the application) prior to being 
interviewed.   You may either have the applicant fill out a form before you 
interview them or you can send the applicant to the 36th floor to fill out 
the forms before you interview them.     
Notify Hector McLoughlin or Frank deJesus if you are interviewing an external 
candidate that is a former excelr employee.    All previous excelr employees 
will be reviewed by HR and Sally Beck prior to being invited to interview.   
We hope that this process will eliminate re-hiring poor performers. 
If you want to make an offer of employment to a candidate for a Management 
Position, please include Sally Beck in the process for input.    As a final 
step of the selection process, Sally would like to meet with the candidate if 
time allows or to phone interview the candidate as an alternative.    Sally's 
involvement should occur after you have identified the candidate as a 
potential Management new hire. 

Thanks for your help with this process.

We discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our

occasions with Mark D. and team to prioritize, etc.  However, I think 
primarily due to the reorg in IT, and Mark leaving the team, we have done a

Jennifer and I met with Hal Elrod yesterday, and I have met with Bob Hillier 
a couple of times, and we seem to be on the right track now.  I know Bob 
Hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs.

Subject: Status - ""PCG wish list""

I just wanted to give you an update on where we are on the PCG wish list.   
We discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our 
list of development/enhancements to our applications.  We met on numerous 
occasions with Mark D. and team to prioritize, etc.  However, I think 
primarily due to the reorg in IT, and Mark leaving the team, we have done a 
lot of talking over the past three weeks, but nothing has happened to date.  
Jennifer and I met with Hal Elrod yesterday, and I have met with Bob Hillier 
a couple of times, and we seem to be on the right track now.  I know Bob 
Hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs.  

My concern is growing due to the fact that Andrew Parsons and team will be 
re-auditing us before the end of the year.  The key control weakness of the 
PCG was the lack of Profiles Manger - I have stressed that this is #1 on the

Subject: Oct. 17 RRC letter re continuing audit violations

 I just received a letter from Ed Abrahamson at the Railroad Commission, 
asserting that we have still not fully corrected or explained all of the 
audit violations they previously alleged.  I will have delivered to each of 
you this afternoon a copy of the letter, to which we must respond by October 
27.  The tone of the letter indicates some frustration on the audit staff's 
part, and it will behoove us to try to get the remaining matters resolved 
promptly.
 I will be out of town Monday, but I will have my assistant, Monica Jackson, 
set up a meeting for Tuesday afternoon to discuss how we are going to satisfy 
the Commission regarding the remaining exceptions.  In the meantime, please 
carefully review each item and commence doing whatever needs to be done to be 
in a position to finalize our response by October 26, Thursday of next week.  
I think some of the fixes will be fairly easy, but others will be more 
problematic.  Please provide this memo and a copy of the letter to anyone who 
should be aware or involved.

Tommy,

The  purpose of these meetings is to flush out a consensus of what clearing 
needs to be in the future.  

We have invited interested parties from London, Calgary and Houston.  Folks 
from Clearing, Legal, Credit, Commodity Logic, and LiveLink have been
invited.

We are asking Legal to clearly define the legal implications of web trading.  
We expect Web based clearing to be a hot topic; CommodityLogic can
represent a piece to the clearing puzzle.

Attached is a tentative agenda.  Let me know if you have any ideas for making 
this as productive as possible.

The  emergence of web trading has important implications for deal clearing.  
Meetings are scheduled for November 16-17 to discuss
these implications and to come to a consensus on a strategic solution for 
deal clearing.  

Please plan to attend or designate someone who can represent you.

Attached please find a tentative schedule for the meetings.

Additional information will follow.

Please feel free to address any questions you might have  regarding these 
meetings to  Sarita Das ( 713 345-8232 ) or Ron Nolte ( 713 853-7569 ).

Thanks for your interest, I will add you.

The meeting arose out of a need to identify where clearing needs to be in the 
future.  Legal will address
the legal implications of confirming web based deals.  It was rumored at one 
time that the web based receipt  was sufficient for confirmation of the 
deal.  

This issue as well as many others will be discussed.

Clearing users from London, Calgary, and Houston will have a chance to 
present their requirements. These requirements will  include
a need for web based clearing,  the nature of which  Commodity Logic is 
developing.  We are currently working closely with the Commodity Logic 
project  in
order to assure that the entire process of clearing deals as it exists today  
can be made as efficient as possible.

Web based clearing will be one of many requirements we hope to flush out 
during these meetings,  Based on the requirements we will
work with London to develop a plan that get us where we need to be.

Thanks for the invite, I will try and make it.

Subject: Doorstep - Settlements

Dan,

The RAC group is currently involved in project Doorstep, which includes a 
review of excelr's trading activities worldwide.  Part of the review includes 
a deal test for each office,  in which we follow a transaction from inception 
through the settlements process.

Kyle Gibson has helped us with the settlements by providing some invoices and 
G/L entries for selected transactions.  In fact, given the deadline Kyle 
indicated to us regarding his own group's close, we reduced the deal 
population in half with the hope of concluding our testing by today.  We 
understand that the monthly close will prevent Kyle from helping us any 
further until tomorrow at noon at the earliest, and that he will be absent 
this afternoon.

Given the large number of trading offices worldwide, each ""Doorstep"" is of 
very short duration.  In fact, part of the testing evaluates the ability of a 
group to pull together all of the supporting documentation for a selection of 
deals within a short time frame.  Given the ""short fuse,"" we must finalize 
our report tomorrow at the latest, and present it on Monday to Sally Beck, 
Ted Murphy, Rick Buy, and Rick Carson among others.

It is important that we be able to mention in this report that the 
settlements group is able to gather this information quickly for a small 
number of transactions (10 overall - although some information has already 
been provided by Kyle).  Are there any other resources in your group who 
would be able to help us meet this deadline?

Thanks, Dan,

Dear Ken, Leslie,

It looks like we have gotten to the bottom of the missing documentation (it 
was there, it was quickly available, Ken did talk to the right people but 
they did not see the urgency of getting the information to Ken).  As a 
result, I think we have to rewrite the information related to this issue in 
the Portland report.  Let's get together for 15 minutes today/tomorrow to 
draft a rewrite of these areas.  

Just as a side note, we need to wait until the report has been changed before 
we share the information with Portland.

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS IN A TRADING ENVIRONMENT

To manage operational risk in a trading environment excelr has designed and=
=20
implemented operational control standards. These standards, which are commo=
n=20
for all businesses, aim to prevent errors and inaccuracies and ensure the=
=20
timely recording of trading transactions.=20

What standards does excelr have in place?

excelr has six fundamental standards for risk management that cover:
- Recording transactions
- Reporting daily profit & loss and risk positions
- Confirmation and execution of transactions
- Settlements with counterparties
- Risk management and settlement system information reflected in the genera=
l=20
ledger
- Implementation of business and control infrastructure

What else is important when controls are implemented?

Implementing segregation of duties within the trading environment ensures=
=20
that no individual has control over all phases of a transaction.   This=20
allows incompatible functional responsibilities to be kept separate,=20
specifically:
- Authorization and execution of transactions
- Recording and performance of transactions
- Monitoring and review of trading activities=20

Why do we need to standardised controls?

To assimilate new or build existing commodity businesses excelr needs to be=
=20
nimble and responsive. A robust and stable control process can be duplicate=
d=20
or flexed quickly and confidently, providing scalability and the capability=
=20
to assess and manage operational risk.

How do we measure successful control?

By identifying and reporting metrics for all standards we build an=20
understanding of compliance across all businesses and seek continual=20
improvement. This compliments the qualitative cross-checking process=20
facilitated by communication between Commercial, Risk Management Operations=
=20
and RAC.

The control measurement process will be part of a global initiative across=
=20
all commodities and locations.

Where can you find details of our fundamental standards?

I received your voicemail this morning and I believe the following will 
answer all your questions:

1.  We are actually fine on Friday night dinners and really only need 
interviewers at this time.

2.  For the first weekend - Oct. 28th - To date, I don't see that anyone from 
your area has signed up to interview.  This may be because this is an 
Associate weekend.

3.  For the second weekend - Nov. 4th - The only person signed up is Pat 
Clynes from Logistics.  The second weekend is really large and we still need 
about 67 interviewers.  We are looking for Managers and above to interview.


4.  Attending schools  October 28th - approx. 55 students (Associate)

    Rice - Grad
    Michigan
    Thunderbird
    UT- Grad

    November 4th - approx. 100 students (Analyst)
    UT- Undergrad
    A&M
    Baylor
    Rice - Undergrad
    Oklahoma
    Florida

5.  Interviewers must check in at 8:00am for interview discussion and 
breakfast - 50M.  They will pick up their schedule and candidate resumes at 
this time.

6.  Interviewers will see 5 candidates and will be assigned to a interview 
team.  Interviews will be conducted between 8:45 - 12:15.

7.  Interviewer/Candidate lunch will be from 12:30-1:30 - The Energizer

8.  The decision making meeting will begin at 1:30pm in 5C2.  All

lately since volumes in Mexico are really picking up....
I am sending you the list of pending To Dos with our counterparties in 
Mexico...Hopefully with your help, we can start shrinking this list...
Thanks also for your time yesterday, and I think it was great to put all 
these items together and have a specific plan of attack for the upcoming 
weeks.
I propose that we get together next week to follow up on this list of pending 
items and evaluate if it is shrinking or not. 
Kind regards. 





Bill, Mark, Sally  and Max as you all know, the volumes of trades going on in 
Mexico, are increasing very rapidly.  Today, we are doing transactions with 
around 50 different counterparties, and have passed the 55 Bcfs of gas mark, 
while we are trying to put Master Agreements in place, and also working very 
intensively with Credit setting up and evaluating many companies that are not 
public.  The Mexican market is "" In diapers"" in terms of risk management, and 
we are trying very hard to open it up, create awareness, and bring volumes to 
excelr. 

As of last September, excelr was the second largest energy risk management 
trading company in Mexico, second to the state monopoly Pemex.  Today, we can 
tell that our volumes are 250% larger than those in september and most 
probably we are by now the leading risk management company in our country.  
Moreover, for many of our customers, these have been their first transactions 
and because of that we need to make an extra effort to ensure that the day to 
day operations run as smoothly as we can. 

I am sending you a copy of what we have to work on, so that you are in the 
loop, and are aware of the resources that this market is demanding us right 
now.

Thanks for your support and I'll keep you posted.

As all of you know we are in the midst of the Fall recruitment process for 
the Analyst and Associate Program - the Super Saturday process.  A major part 
of the process is the Saturday interview which has been changed this year.  
Interviewers now only review five candidates and the ""offer "" decision is now 
completed on the same day as the interview.  This decision process is 
facilitated by a member of excelr's executive committee and should be 
completed by 3:30 pm.  ENA is one of the major users of the Analyst and 
Associate pool and needs to be well represented at Super Saturday (which we 
are not at this time).  The Program still needs additional interviewers and 
the Office of the Chairman of ENA needs you to support the Program and the 
interview process.  Signing up is now easier than ever and all you need to do 
is access the following web site and fill in a few blanks.  The web site is 
as follows:  http://axis.excelr.com/notice/ssinvite.asp.  The dates of Super 
Saturday's are listed below:  

     Associates:   Analysts:
     October 28   November 4
     November 11   November 18
     December 2   December 9
     December 15

The selection of qualified candidates is important to ENA  and excelr.  Your 
participation is needed, now especially for the October 28th and November 4th 
dates.  Please respond accordingly. 

Thanks,
Ted

Subject: Notes on ASE Studio

Hello Mary- 

Here is a rough strating point of the ASE Studio planning document.  I have 
included the objectives we discussed initially - we will continue to refine 
them as we move forward.  

Also, I inserted the notes I made during the offsite on Friday.  My notes 
were primarily focused on information that the participants were wanting or 
that I thought might be useful.  Also, I jotted down quite a few questions 
that came up during the session.  Some of them were addressed on Friday and 
others were not.  We do not necessarily need to address all of these at the 
ASE - and I would suspect there are others that should be addressed but are 
not listed here.  I'm sending this information in advance for your review and 
thought.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss, please let me know.

Subject: Re: Livelink  

Ryan, thank you for your timely response.   It is a concern of mine that our 
current test sytems does not represent the current production system.  I feel 
we run a large risk by not adequately testing a product and all associated 
processes prior to moving it into production.  My concerns are based on the 
following: 

The volume of data that ENA puts into the Livelink system daily, and 
ultimately into iRIMS, exceeds any load testing that OpenText has done. 
 Due to our volume, without testing it is unknown if the performance will be 
adequate.  
There is an inherent risk to putting such a heavy volume application into 
production without proper load testing.
Being the test database server is not the same as the production database 
server, how will we ever know if the application will work?  More so, how 
will we be able to test the restore procedures?
iRIMS testing will include custom modules for iRIMS/Livelink migration.  This 
will require testing of ""adding classifications"" to  massive amounts of 
LiveLink folders.  The current volume is somewhere around 500,000 folders.  
It is my understanding the current test system can not handle this volume.  
The implementation of iRIMS effects the Livelink repository which needs to be 
tested as well.  There is some concern as to; can the current test system 
accommodate this.  

The question of having another Unix 4500 which will give us an identical test 
database or something smaller that might accomplish the same end result is 
one I can not answer.  However,  I would look to you and your technical team 
for recommendations in this matter and would agree to serving on the 
evaluation team.

If you have any questions please feel free to call me at 58841 and as usual, 
thank you for your help and support on this project.

Regards,


Joel

Hi Joel,
 The project plan at this point is very preliminary.  There will be a revised 
(more accurate) plan by the end of next week when OTPS and EDMS have time to 
meet with Carolyn and Barbara.  This is scheduled for next Wed.

This is complete;
Server for iRIMS Beta 9.0 is at Ardmore
iRIMS Test has been created (Oracle)
Test Data from EDMS Test is being copied at this time


Do you want me to purchase another Unix 4500 for Livelink (300K) that will 
give us an identical test database or should I look at getting a smaller less 
expensive Unix box?  Please inform and I will move ahead.

Thanks in advance,

have some legal, tax and obviously back office things to sort out (so 
basically as soon as commercially possible!).

They flew back to Houston today, so I expect to hear more details in a couple

we need to get with Brenda and her group to sort out the back office details

Per Dorie, there will be an interactive invitation to Office of the Chair 
offsite (probably the beginning of next week).  With a click, you will RSVP & 
indicate whether or not you need airline reservations.  If so, you will be 
forwarded to a travel agent who has been selected to make these 
reservations.  Do you want me to make back-up reservations just in case 
preferable flights get booked early?

Dorie,
Are you making airline reservations?  I checked with you several weeks ago & 
you said everyone needed to make their own arrangements - Is this still the 
case or will you be handling?  If so, please call me so we can make 
arrangements for Sally Beck.

UAT on phase 1 of this application development has identified previously 
unforeseen technical and functional requirements/issues. Consequently, a 
comprehensive re-specification and re-planning exercise for DTL has been 
completed such as to give a much later implementation timetable.

Given the immediate, and absolute, need to implement the more significant of 
the control and efficiency improvements identified in this project along with 
the competing demands for existing IT development resource we have decided to 
:-

pause development work on the DTL application ( specifically )
apply business analysis resources on the full redesign and documentation of 
ledger control and reporting processes
complete the process changes within the Trade Accounting area that have been 
on-going for the last 6 months
reassign IT resources to the Enlighten and Envoice projects
reassess the timetable for the delivery of the residual DTL control and 
efficiency improvements by re-preforming the business case for the DTL 
application following the completion of the above identified work

Please feel free to discuss any of the above issues with us

John & Mike

Dear Shona,

Actually, I am waiting on the deal test samples from Leslie (if this is still 
the game plan) before giving Jennifer the total package, which Jennifer 
understands.  She followed up with a call requesting a summary of findings in 
lieu of the working papers, at least for now.  She is calling me everyday, 
and I think it would be good to bring closure to this.  I have not heard 
anything from Leslie.  If you and Leslie are happy with the remainder of the 
deal test, I will x-ref the working papers as such, and we can ship the 
papers on to Jennifer.

Thanks, Shona!

Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:




As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

We are starting to think more about the baby's room . . .  I think we're
leaning towards using your bed, if that's still okay.   Did you say that the
changing table would be available, too?  Is it light wood also?
I think we will probably get our own bed linens - but what do your look
like?   Boyish?   Do you think it's better to use a rocker or a glider?

Sorry we didn't make it for a fall trip.   It seems that almost every
weekend one of us has been gone - Chris leaves for Asia on Thursday for 2
weeks - it's a nonstop whirlwind of travel!

Thanksgiving should be fun . . . what shall we bring?     Is there any sort
of a plan for Friday?

I had my monthly doctor's appointment today:  the baby is still in there and
her mom is getting very fat!

I have really enjoyed my Halloween nutcracker this season!      Love, Cara

Help review the individual reporting to determine if:
It is adequate
Where we should go from the current reporting guidelines
Decide on appropriate audiences and levels for issue communication
Decide on reporting formats
Steer the process

Subject: Clearing User Meetings

I have attached the e-mail that Ron Nolte sent to the Deal Clearing user 
community regarding the meeting
that is scheduled for November 16-17.   Please note that this is a meeting 
organized by the IT community, not
the user community.

As you may remember, Stephen Schwarz organized a similar meeting last fall in 
order to provide the IT group
with an agenda of what projects the user community considered to be priority 
projects.  However, the arrival of
EOL greatly altered the IT resources available to concentrate on those 
priority projects.  Today, the deal 
clearing community is struggling to get IT resources due to new systems such 
as ClickPaper.com, Commodity
Logic, project Thunderball  and a new weather capture and confirmation 
system.  This has created some internal 
conflict since each user group supported by the IT deal clearing applications 
group is requesting that their projects 
be set as the top priority project.  

This is a quick outline of the challenges facing both the deal clearing user 
community and the IT group supporting
this group.  I would be happy to discuss any questions you have about either 
the meeting or these challenges.

we are proposing on CL.  One question I'm exploring right now is whether we 
could save more money from an excelr perspective and achieve greater 
marketability with the model that ConfirmCorp proposes with automated 
matching vs. the Commodity Logic/Williams approach that depends on users 
reviewing/approving confirms (we've simply put the current process online so 
to speak).  We need to push for a more radical change/improvement on a faster 
timeline.   I still believe confirms is the correct area to be focusing on, 
as I mentioned in our meeting with Louise, but we need to seriously review 
what we propose to deliver and how.  Is ConfirmCorp a viable company to bring 
under the excelr umbrella?

I think we should be concerned that late entry with less functionality will 
erode our ability to sign up customers.  I don't think each large marketer 
will want to log in to several sites to clear their confirmations with each 
of their large counterparties.

Can we find out if Williams has further plans for their service that would 
compete with Commodity Logic?

Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

excelr WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming excelr Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
excelr=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

excelr Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include excelr=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) excelr Global Assets.  In addition, excelr=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of excelr Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of excelr Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of excelr APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of excelr Global Assets. excelr Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of excelr=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of excelr APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
excelr=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into excelr Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, will be joining EE=

to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of excelr Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of excelr Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

excelr Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of excelr Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

excelr Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to excelr Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating excelr=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, excelr Americas.  excelr Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for excelr=20
Americas.

excelr Europe
The excelr Europe organization, which includes excelr=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and excelr Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

excelr Global Markets
excelr Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for excelr=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
excelr Global Assets.  excelr Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

excelr Industrial Markets
excelr Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=

newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of excelr Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=

ue=20
to support all other excelr businesses operating in their respective regions=

and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=

basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
excelr Net Works, and excelr Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for excelr Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20

How odd ? I came away with the impression that:

we would look at the outgoing commercial instructions to see whether they 
support the activity of the guys in Chicago with phones in their hands, and 
are in themselves wholly appropriate;
we would address the issue of not having taped lines;
we would address the issue of segregation of duties in the office, other than 
in Powerpoint
we would get to the bottom of the difference between the AS400 and ""Local 
Access Database""
we would see a business model that defines how the office functions as an 
""origination only"" office
we would see a revised timeline for the resolution of the other issues in the 
review

Subject: Doorstep meeting

Shona

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the 
transparency and accountability of issues raised. 

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient' 
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin 
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the 
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from 
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get 
an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we 
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a 
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their 
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down 

Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns 
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems 
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues
Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate 
that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date. 
Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict

one was hurt.  I had not heard about it until Mo called me today.  Please let 
me know if there is anything that I can do.  Do you need me to get you 
anything over here and ship it to London?  

I can certainly understand that you will reconsider the trip to Houston next 
week.  I know that you must have hundreds of details to handle.  

My plan right now is to be off the week of Thanksgiving.   My nanny will be 
on vacation that whole week so that she can make a trip out of town.  I may 
do some work early in the week, but likely from home.  The week after 
Thanksgiving I am supposed go to Wellesley College (Boston area) to interview 
for the analyst program.  I am due at a reception on Monday night (November 
27) and I will interview on Tuesday (November 28).  Assuming that I can get a 
flight back on Tuesday night, I will be in the office here in Houston 
Wednesday through Friday that week.  Would that work?  Sorry I am out so much

I just left a message with Chris Hanz and Steve Stock who are both Sr. 
Directors under Beth Perlman.  Given the office visit schedules - Chris and 
Steve will likely only be available at the following times:

Chris to meet with Chris Hoyle  After 10:30 a.m.
Steve to meet with John Rodgers From 1:00 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.


I will let you know as soon as I hear from them and confirm.

s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

excelr WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming excelr Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
excelr=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

excelr Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include excelr=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) excelr Global Assets.  In addition, excelr=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of excelr Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of excelr Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of excelr APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of excelr Global Assets. excelr Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of excelr=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of excelr APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of excelr India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
excelr=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into excelr Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of excelr Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of excelr Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

excelr Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of excelr Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

excelr Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to excelr Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating excelr=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, excelr Americas.  excelr Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for excelr=20
Americas.

excelr Europe
The excelr Europe organization, which includes excelr=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and excelr Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

excelr Global Markets
excelr Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for excelr=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
excelr Global Assets.  excelr Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

excelr Industrial Markets
excelr Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of excelr Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other excelr businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
excelr Net Works, and excelr Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for excelr Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for excelr Global Markets and excelr Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for excelr Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=

continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

excelr GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND excelr WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=

around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=

EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by excelr=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across excelr=01,s businesses a=

the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

excelr places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says ""internally"" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

excelr places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

The set-up for the financial trading is similiar except that the instructions 
are relaid by e-mail each night to New York and Tokyo.  Tim Pateman 
(authorised trader in London) sends details of positions and instructions on 
prices / volumes. 

The mail provide directions on pricing (off set basis on EOL) and volumes, 
creating an envelope in which they can trade.
They  must call for further instructions if the price shifts by more than $10 
($100 for Tin & Nickel)  or the position by more than 100 lots.

David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says ""internally"" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Regards,
Tim

I am not quite there I am afraid. Are you saying that the folks outside NY 
and London have no autonomy and are merely acting on trading instructions 
issued by the London or NY trading desks ? If that is the case:

Why don't NY and London do the deals themselves and let the locals 
concentrate on generating business ?
There should be no ""Chicago Book"" (SCRP) for example
That conflicts with the ""envelope"" which you mention, which appears to be a

for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20

to simultaneously come up with a way to diffuse without bastardizing the

and ""gut reaction"" is preferable to consensus and prosecutable evidence,  I

Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units

outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for

Using the data you kindly sent me I had one of my guys extract the

I am glad to say that the human error rate is very low and over this

errors on around 120 officialised DPRs.

Subject: 2001 Group Expenses

Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.



Regards
Delainey

inroads into Japan.

The presidents of Tokyo Power and Chubu Power announced that in the spring, 
they and eight other Japanese power companies would merge their 
telecommunications and Internet businesses into a new company.  This company 
seems to be based on a telecommunications joint venture (PNJ Communications) 
that they formed last year.  They are hoping to get 20% of their capital from 
the American company Qwest Communications International.

It is not strange to see Japanese companies cooperating with competitors.  
Joint ventures with Western companies are still rare, but less so recently, 
given the longevity of the economic malaise in Japan, and the severe 
profitability and balance sheet problems of some Japanese companies.  
Nevertheless, as far as I know, this is the first time that power companies 
have made such an effort.  In the past, they have generally maintained 
mutually respectful local monopolies.  I think that deregulation has them 
very worried.  I imagine that they will continue with this cooperation as 
they feel more and more threatened by excelr and other Western companies.

Subject: Rollout of ATHENA (Formerly known as the DPR database)


Dear All,
 
Risk Analytics, has recently finished developing ATHENA (the database that 
warehouses all of the official DPR data of excelr), which is designed to make 
your work easier by giving you the following tools and breakdowns:

1. P&L Component Breakdowns
? Hedge Management
? Prudency
? Curve Shift
? New Deals

2. Risk Analysis Tools
? VARs
? Maturity Gap Risk
? Net Open Position
? Daily loss limits

The warehoused information, which is broken down by books and parts (P&L 
component breakdowns/risk analysis tools), now has the visual aid of numerous 
bar graphs and pie charts used to represent the information listed above - 
provided to you at the touch of a button.  These charts are not only very 
easy to understand, but will be helpful in your daily work analyzing trading 
information.  

Now that all commodity groups are performing additional analysis and 
providing reports other than P&L and positions to both MRM RAC and commercial 
departments, the tools provided by ATHENA have been proven to be extremely 
useful.  

ATHENA makes analysis of the time trend of data an effortless process, as it 
has warehoused data for the past year for each commodity.

The rollout of ATHENA is currently underway, according to the following 
timeline:

? From now until Friday November 10th, access to the database is being given 
to the beta testers (testers already chosen).
? Monday November 13th - First instructional training class from 4-5pm. 
Conference room 3270.
? Thursday November 16th - Second instructional training class from 3-4pm.  
Conference room 3270.  
? Subsequent classes will be scheduled depending on need.
? Production users will have access to the database within the few weeks 
following November 16th.
  
Each of these sessions will hold up to 15 participants, and attendees are 
taken on a first come first serve basis.  Please contact Pamela Sonnier (ext. 
37531) to sign up for one of these training sessions.

We expect that all business controllers will want to have access to ATHENA. 
Additionally, there may be other employees in your group who need access.  
Please send all requests for access to ATHENA to Maria Teresa Aguilera-Peon 
(ext. 35257), Jennifer Nguyen (ext. 57590), or Eugenio Perez (ext. 35828) 

For further information on ATHENA, or to set up a one on one demonstration, 
call Eugenio Perez (X35828), Maria Teresa Peon (X35257) or Jennifer Nguyen 
(X57590).

Best regards and looking forward to working with you,

information. 

Further note that IT drives many of our critical dates.  Since our last

considered top priority as the IT team will focus on the off balance sheet 
financing that must be in place by calendar year end.  Also, with the London

Shona

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the 
transparency and accountability of issues raised. 

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient' 
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin 
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the 
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from 
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get 
an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we 
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a 
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their 
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down 

Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns 
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems 
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues
Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate 
that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date. 
Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict 
systematically with the above instructions
All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls 
exist and function in NY
Marcelo / Me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business 
communications on roles and responsibilities
Myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and 
monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens

Will call later

the major hurdles.  After further discussions it was suggested a

excelr Europe General Announcement
14/11/2000 13:00
Please respond to Mike Jordan/LON/ECT
To: ECT Europe, ECT Asia Pacific
cc:  

Subject: Newsletter: GlobalFlash!







John Sherriff writes.......

excelr Trading is all about a unique combination of being ""tight"" and 
""loose"".  We give the managers of our trading books tremendous freedom 
(""loose"")
to make decisions on the spot and manage for profitability.  We can do this 
because we have a standard way of controlling (""tight"") that is consistent
from trading book to trading book.

Summarized below are the highlights of our fundamental risk management 
standards.  These standards are an integral part of our trading discipline 
and culture and we expect all our employees both commercial and noncommercial 
to absolutely understand these control standards.  These standards will 
evolve over time (especially as we move to new electronic trading methods) 
but the basics of separation of duties and accurate reporting are at the 
cornerstone of
our business.  So please ask plenty of questions about these standards, make 
sure you understand them and let us know when we are not living up to them.  

Questions and feedback should be directed to Mike Jordan on extension 34703.



RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS IN A TRADING ENVIRONMENT

To manage operational risk in a trading environment excelr has designed and 
implemented operational control standards. These standards, which are common 
for all businesses, aim to prevent errors and inaccuracies and ensure the 
timely recording of trading transactions. 

What standards does excelr have in place?

excelr has six fundamental standards for risk management that cover:
- Recording transactions
- Reporting daily profit & loss and risk positions
- Confirmation and execution of transactions
- Settlements with counterparties
- Risk management and settlement system information reflected in the general 
ledger
- Implementation of business and control infrastructure

What else is important when controls are implemented?

Implementing segregation of duties within the trading environment ensures 
that no individual has control over all phases of a transaction.   This 
allows incompatible functional responsibilities to be kept separate, 
specifically:
- Authorization and execution of transactions
- Recording and performance of transactions
- Monitoring and review of trading activities 

Why do we need to standardised controls?

To assimilate new or build existing commodity businesses excelr needs to be 
nimble and responsive. A robust and stable control process can be duplicated 
or flexed quickly and confidently, providing scalability and the capability 
to assess and manage operational risk.

How do we measure successful control?

By identifying and reporting metrics for all standards we build an 
understanding of compliance across all businesses and seek continual 
improvement. This compliments the qualitative cross-checking process 
facilitated by communication between Commercial, Risk Management Operations 
and RAC.

The control measurement process will be part of a global initiative across 
all commodities and locations.

Where can you find details of our fundamental standards?

The report is usually produced on Monday mornings UK time, so should be ready

Subject: Ops Weekly Update

Ted mentioned to me that you guys receive or participate or just know of some 
type of weekly excelr Europe update on Fridays for Sherriff??? or some top guy 
over there, and that Risk Operations (New/Jordan etc.) prepare a report for 
that update.  Meanwhile, back in Houston we (MRM) independently prepare a 
weekly update for Rick Buy on Thursdays.  I'd like to get a copy of the 
report done last week, and talk to whoever in MRM participates, if anyone 
does, or if it's just Ops then whoever that is.  I think Ted was thinking we 
could leverage off this report and maybe move Rick Buy's weekly update back a 
day to coincide.

Do you know what I'm talking about?  Or should I talk to Lloyd or Oliver? I'd 
like to discuss after the morning meeting tomorrow if you have a minute - 
maybe you can also fax or e-mail the report?  

Thanks,
Cassandra.

fill the gaps and explore opportunities to make more efficient use of SAP in 
the areas of Financial, Human Resources and Global Sourcing.  Melissa Becker 
will coordinate the efforts of the various teams.

The Financial teams, including process leveraging (with Jan Johnson as lead) 
and reporting (led by Mark Frank), will be working together over the next 6 
to 12 months since their objectives touch or overlap in many areas.  
Together, this effort is Project Sunrise.  The teams will be gathering 
information from accounting personnel in each BU about key information needs 
and key processes, to identify opportunities that would benefit all BUs as 
well as to identify BU-specific opportunities that the BUs may wish to pursue.

The teams' objectives are to work with the BUs to:

1. Create better, more user-friendly reporting capabilities
A. Implement short term measures to address current ""hot"" reporting issues 
(e.g., labor distribution and project management) (Susan Bellinghausen is 
spearheading this effort.)
B. Develop and implement medium term measures to improve access to 
information (e.g., data warehouse with web-based access)
C. Develop and implement longer term web-based tool addressing 4 key areas 
(costs, P&L, counterparties and cash)
2. Improve processes to provide better quality, more timely information
A. Implement process changes required to execute reporting objectives
B. Shorten close process
C. Improve basic ""blocking & tackling"" related to controls 
D. Share best practices among BUs

Representatives from the BUs working on these two teams will be:

Steve Thatcher  ENA
Caroline Lothian Europe
Joe Darensbourg International regions
Howard Selzer  International regions
Steve Frazier  EES
Madeline Chan  EBS
Dave Wittenburg ETS
Jill Erwin  Corp Acctg and EGF

The following are subject matter experts (SMEs) in various BUs and functional 
groups who will spend varying amounts of their time in addressing specific 
issues.

James Weitekamp ETS (planning)
Sayed Khoja  EGM 
Allen Ueckert  International regions (project systems)
Glenn Kobes  Tax
Brandee Sanborn ISC

We will continue to identify others who will share their expertise.

The following people will be working specifically on data warehouse and 
web-based reporting initiatives:

Beverly Fennesey ISC 
Li Chan   ENA
Pat Cagney  EES

The teams will begin by interviewing persons identified by the CAO of each 
BU, to determine their information needs and to review their processes, while 
continuing to develop the data warehouse and creating the web-based reporting 
tool.  The efforts of the process leveraging and reporting teams are vital to 
our being able to quickly obtain key information to run our businesses.  I 
appreciate all of your efforts to date with regard to SAP and now, Project 
Sunrise.  The ultimate success of these efforts depends on all of us working 
together to learn to fully utilize and optimize the new tools we have 
available to us.  Thanks again for all your help.",Non Abusive

FYI.  Having never worked with Whalley before, I may never hear back from 
him.   We'd like to obtain documentation signed by Skilling/Buy authorizing 
the top traders for specific commodity groups (Lavorato/Sherriff/Shankman), 
then we'll get those top traders to designate head traders, and so on down 
the line.  If you have any insight as to the commodity group assignments 
listed below, please let me know.  And since you probably see Whalley often, 
perhaps you could mention it.  I think Shona's group wants to reclassify the 
DPR accordingly, but they're not certain on some of these either.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Subject: Head Trader Authorization

Greg -

We haven't met yet - I joined Market Risk Management working for Ted Murphy 
about a month ago, focusing on the Risk Management Policy.  One item I'm 
working on is documentation of the Head Traders and Authorized Traders.    It 
seems after the organizational anouncement last week that you are the top 
management and focal point for all of the trading activities in excelr 
Wholesale Services.  As such, would you please review the draft memo below 
(also attached) and confirm whether this appropriately documents your wishes 
as far as designation of Head Traders for each commodity group authorized in 
the policy?  We'd like to get Skilling/Buy to sign this top level of trading 
authority delegation.  Then I'll obtain from each of the Head Traders their 
respective lists of Authorized Traders to whom they've further delegated 
trading authority.  This will support Rick Buy's goal that RAC maintain a 
list of authorized traders, with the appropriate documentation of that 
authorization.

Please don't read anything into the assignments themselves if I got them 
wrong - we made an educated guess with all the recent reorganizations.  For 
example - who is the Head Trader for Southern Cone Gas and Power - is it 
really Kishkill?  And as McMahon and Bowen aren't traders, do trading 
activities for Pulp & Paper, Lumber and Steel fall to Sherriff or someone 
else?  

If you prefer me to obtain Head Trader names for each commodity group from 
Lavorato/Sherriff/Shankman, I can do so, but please confirm I have the 
commodity group responsibilities correct among the 3 of them.

Thank you,

The demo uses actual data from Sempra, our largest volume natgas financial

Sempra data (received electronically as an excel spreadsheet and stored on a 
mini version of our Deal Database), immediately matching about 1450 of the 
1500 deals.  It then helps the user to manually match those 50 deals that the 
primary match engine could not.  This whole process, if it were purely 
manual, would take more than a day.  Using excel spreadsheets (and sort 
functions), excelr currently spends 4 to 8 hours per month matching Sempra 
invoices. FIX allows the user to perform all matching in about 10 minutes.

would call and make an appointment on Monday.  In the meantime, I threw away 
her name and cannot for the life of me remember.  I have been pretty busy the 
last couple of days so I do apologize for the delay.  Please e-mail me back.

Thanks

		 Subject: Telephone Recording

Dear Kathy & Darren,
     I've spoken with Marcelo Parra here in New York regarding phone 
recording for the excelr Metals offices.  The RAC group insists that recording 
is done ASAP and I need to report back to Marcelo the install dates of the 
equipment in Montreal and St. Louis.  If you have such info or know who is 
responsible, please let me know.  
     I understand that we are several months away from the installation of a 
new switch with central recording capability here at the 520 Madison office 
in New York.   As an alternative, I can install a refurbished digital 
recording system for 24 telephones on the Concentrates and Metals trading 
desks for approximately $45,000.   The recording device will be located in 
our telephone room and is not accessible to the traders.  All equipment is in 
stock and we can have the desks recorded by December 1.   I need a quick 
approval since the vendor will only hold refurbished equipment until Friday 
afternoon for us.  Barry, can you give the OK?
    Also, recording for the Chicago office should not be an issue since the 
excelr Metals people are moving to the existing excelr Chicago facilities 
before the end of the year.

Best  regards,
Mike

Meeting.  ENA Management Committee  I represented some of you during the 
mid-year PRC meeting, and some of you are new to my list of Associates to 
represent.  

I have copied you on an e:mail message that I sent to your supervisor of 
record as of October 1, according to the records of the Analysts and 
Associates Program.  You will note that I have asked your supervisor to 
provide a list of your accomplishments for the second half of the year, as 
well as a description of your job responsibilities.  You may want to take 
charge of creating this information.  In addition to the input that I have 
requested from your supervisor, it would be helpful for me to have a copy of 
your resume (not necessary to repeat, if you gave me one at mid-year).  While 
the PRC process will focus on your accomplishments during the prescribed time 
period at excelr, it enhances my ability to represent you in the process if I 
have some background information on you.  

My assistant will contact you during the next few days to set up a time for 
me to meet with each one of you, if you would like to do so before the PRC 
meeting.  These meetings will be scheduled during the weeks of November 27 
and December 4.  I will also meet or talk with your supervisor during those 
two weeks in preparation for the PRC meeting.

He reports to me locally, but functionally he would traditionally have

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.

Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Doorstep - ""enpower"" is a metaphor for a risk management system that isn't an 
abomination (which was the current state at the time).  Have they made 
improvements to said abomination that are acceptable for the current level of 
business. Enpower seems to be acceptable to all.  Clearly, my appetite for 
supporting more risk on an inferior platform is close to zero.  More 
importantly in the global competition for capital of all kind, the standard 
is not controlled spreadsheets, i.e., last time I spoke to Peter Lynch, Jim 
Rogers, and Archie McCallister, they were on more sophisticated platforms 
with infinitely more functionality.

CommodityLogic's financial management module is offering an ""exposure 
tracker"" in its version 2.0 release scheduled for Dec 15.  The credit 
deparment has raised issues on the accuracy of the data this feature will 
display and has suggested we meet with you and your group to discuss how we 
can ensure we have good data.   Apparently, they have to do a lot of manual 
calculations on the existing data, and we are asking for a daily feed with 
lots of counterparties.

how we can address this issue;  what time is best for you?  Call me if you

Sally,

I have not worked directly with Sheri Thomas until last week.  I work with 
members of her group and we have successfully managed to take care of 
trader's wishes for more flexibility related to logging in one time and 
having the trades mapped to the appropriate system depending on commodity 
traded.  The process is still taken care of through 'back-screen' programming 
and in my opinion should be easier to apply to all traders with 
cross-commodity portfolios.  The only one on one contact I have had with 
Sheri was to request that Power Risk be involved in the approval process when 
a trader was requesting an EOL login id.  There have been instances when 
traders will get set up on EOL but have not been set up in Enpower.  When 
this happens their transaction will not bridge because there is no place for 
them to go as Enpower has no way of recognizing them as a trader.  Sheri 
talked to one of her group members and had them include myself and my leads 
(for back-up) into the approval process of EOL trader setup.

She was understanding and responsive to my request.  I do not feel that I 
have had the appropriate exposure to her work to give her a formal rating, 
but I wanted to share the minimal experience I have had for your reviewal 
process.

have not been followed by everyone. 

The following memo documents the procedures to 1) set up a new curve, 2) set 
up a new book, and 3) change a portfolio hierarchy.  Please note that risk 
management (for each commodity group), ""risk management""  is responsible for 
ensuring that information is flowing appropriately between the valuation 
systems and RisktRAC (Risk Analysis and Reporting can help, but do not have 
all of the ERMS information to be able to ensure the completeness of 
RisktRAC).

I have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of 
this memo.  Please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy. 

The procedure to set up a new curve is as follows:

Trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new 
curve set up
Trader communicates this to risk management
Risk management constructs new curve in ERMS (with the help of the IT 
department)
Risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in 
RisktRAC
Curve form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up curve in RisktRAC
A system generated message is sent to people on the ""curve list"" indicating a 
change in the RisktRAC curves has been made

If the curve is not set up in RisktRAC the positions are not captured in the 
VAR or engine, thereby making VAR inaccurate.  As a side note, Risk Analysis 
and Reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new 
curves set up in ERMS are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in 
RisktRAC.  We did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in 
ERMS that are not in RisktRAC - which we are working with you to resolve.

The procedure to set up a new book in RisktRAC is as follows:

Trader/risk management determines new book is needed
New book request form (for RisktRAC) is completed by risk management
New book request form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up book in RisktRAC
Risk Analysis and Reporting forwards request to ERMS administrator and global 
counterparty group to request that book is set up in valuation and 
counterparty systems
Once all groups have completed their individual set ups, a final e-mail is 
sent to personnel on the ""books list"" and the book administrator in the risk 
management department who requested the book

It is important that there is a one to one link between the ERMS and RisktRAC 
books, or not all positions will be captured in RisktRAC (two commodities per 
ERMS book does not flow properly into RisktRAC).

The above two processes have formally existed for a number of months.  
Additionally, we are formalizing the procedure for changing portfolio 
hierarchies.  The procedure now is:

Risk management is responsible for requesting all portfolio hierarchy 
changes.  Previously, changes could be made through a request by Risk 
Analysis and Reporting or RAC.  These two groups are no longer allowed to 
submit change requests.  All requests must come through risk management.
Risk management completes a request, including the reason for the requested 
change in structure
Risk management forwards the request to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting makes the change and notifies risk management 
that the change has been made.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please call: me X39123, 
Chris Abel X33012, Burton McIntyre X57197, or Susan Trevino X31462.

FYI - no action required

This note and an earlier email ( forwarded separately ) highlights issues 
around some transactions originated within Metals that arose due to

Cornfield ( Risk ), Lloyd Fleming ( RAC ) and Shane Dallman ( FX desk  -

It is pleasing that people in the control environment picked up the issues on

Subject: excelr Metals FX status

The following issues have been resolved today following discussions with 
Metals Commercial, Risk Management and RAC:

5m Euro prop trade:  It has been agreed that this will be closed out 
immediately.  Metals traders will be advised that FX exposure may only be 
generated as part of a hedge position to an underlying metal trade, and that 
any FX exposure must be laid off via Roger  Murray-Evans (Metals FX trader) 
and the Global Markets desk.

Averaging trades (FX and Bullion): Change method of booking trades so that 
the averaging leg of all trades is booked as it arises (i.e. daily) and the 
resulting FX exposure is captured daily and laid off with Global Markets as 
part of the metals aggregation.

A number of other matters, which have been under discussion for some time, 
were also agreed:- 

Euro / Ali option:  Currently operates under a $30m FX limit and is managed 
by Tim Jones.  It has been agreed that this limit will be reduced to $20m 
(EMRAC to approve) and be a part of Gary Hickerson's limit.  As the options 
expire, the limit will be progressively reduced.  The limit applies only to 
this transaction and does not cover any other FX dealing by excelr Metals.  
Any subsequent transactions of this nature will be covered under separately 
proposed limits.

Overnight exposure: excelr Metals to apply for a small overnight limit to 
cover trades booked after the end of day cut-off.   $2m total net open 
position has been proposed, to be agreed with Gary Hickerson and form part of 
his limits.

FX position management:  FX exposure generated through the day to be 
aggregated and passed to the Global Markets desk.

Subject: excelr Metals FX

Rick,

I thought you might be interested in some information brought to me today by 
Andy Cornfield (Director with the London Risk Management Operations team), 
with regard to FX positions at excelr Metals:-

The overall FX exposure of the metals business is not yet routinely laid off 
with the FX / Interest rates desk.  

Euro currency exposure associated with a Euro Aluminium option is managed by 
Tim Jones, the Head of the Metals Financial Trading desk.  This position is 
managed under a limit of $30m, which was MG's old FX limit.   excelr Metals is 
treating this limit as an excelr Corporate FX limit for the purposes of 
managing this position and all other FX exposure.

Proprietary FX positions are occasionally being taken - most recently, Andy 
has found that yesterday a metals trader opened a long Euro 5 million 
position for value 28/11.  The trader is not the principal FX trader on the 
metals desk, although he was formerly an FX trader with Billiton (acquired by 
MG in 1999)  and he became MG's assistant FX trader prior to excelr's 
acquisition of MG.

With regard to the last item, Risk Management and RAC discussed this with 
Mike Hutchinson and it was agreed that the Euro 5m position will be closed 
out tomorrow. 

As far as the first two items are concerned, RAC and Risk Management will be 
working with Commercial heads to help ensure that excelr Corporate policy is 
clearly communicated and applied.

Subject: Re: Cross calibration for Operations people globally  

I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be 
held in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be 
held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC 
meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary 
due to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed 
in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  

The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM 
and EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior 
Specialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review 
meetings mirror the ""preferred distribution"", which as you probably know 
suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should 
therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work 
has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not 
be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the 
managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good 
jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing 
suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I 
still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss 
my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of 
course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels 
that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my 
direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda 
Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to 
attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  

Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this 
year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the 
year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in 
Houston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would 
make sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.

I have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about 
checking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) 
which raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross 
calibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?

Subject: Business Cards

Louise,

I don't think I have seen you this year - Happy New Year!

I have been asked what company name should be put on the business cards of 
some of Sally Beck's group.  I have been telling most people to stick with 
they organisation names e.g. excelr North America or excelr South America, 
rather than excelr Americas/excelr Wholesale Services.  Do you want everybody 
to use excelr Net Works, or should the trading support groups use their 
business unit names ENA, EGM, EIM?

See you soon.

Nicki

P.S.  Mark gave me a voucher for Urban Retreat for Christmas, which I am very 
pleased with.  Sue's jealous, she got crystal!

all participants starting Wednesday December 6, 2000 to Monday, December 11, 
2000.  Tuesday, December 12th will be reserved for rescheduling of 
interviews.   

The interviews will be scheduled for 30 minutes and will be conducted by two

interviews, the technical team will review the documented interviews to 
determine any required missing information.    When possible, we will try to 
replace the followup interview with a followup email and/or phone call to 
limit your time commitment.  

Typical follow-up questions will be:   
What are your sources of data/information?  
Where is the data/information currently stored?  
Is the data/information automatically fed into SAP from another system?
Please provide samples of reports/queries (including detailed calculations) 
that demonstrate the information you desire.   

Please be prepared to answer the above mentioned questions and/or refer us to 
the appropriate parties so that we can all make the best use of our time.  
Please let me know your availability.  We will work around your schedule but 
would prefer to conduct the interviews 9:00 am to 2:00 pm to permit writeups

I think that four weeks is a good time frame for this - we can re-evaluate at 
the end of that period as to whether or not this is still needed.  As far as 
the right time, you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest 
(global products).  They can give you the best estimate on timing.  I am 
copying them on this memo. 

When your schedule is set, I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with 
a copy of the schedule (dates, names and contact numbers).  Please send me a 
copy as well.  This IT presence on the floor during critical calculation 
times will be very much appreciated.  I understand that not only will this 
provide immediate contact when and if system issues arise, but that your team 
will be working with the book administrators on improving spreadsheet 
macros.

I am currently working on a plan for floor support to provide a better time 
coverage. I would like to hear your suggestion. I have been thinking of 
providing floor support till 8:00 p.m. every weekday for the next 4 weeks. Do

arrive to get a feel of your businesses and to give both of you an update on 
the new and improved Global Rates Group, after the partial implementation of 
MKM.   I would also appreciate it, if I could unobtrusively sit with several 
of your risk groups, in order to among other things, get an idea of the types 
of commodities London trades and their respective Exchanges.  This would 
allow to familiarize myself with the current process that London uses to 
capture commodity rates.  

After a couple of days in your shop, I am confident that I could come back to 
Houston with a much better idea of how Global Rates could be of the most 
benefit to London.

This trip would of course be charged to the Global Rates CC and not allocated 
back to London, since it is a ""discovery""  trip, which we have budgeted for 
in our 2001 budget.

I wouldn't want this to interfere in anyway with your ongoing business, 
therefore would you please let me know when you and James would be in London 
during the next couple of  weeks and I will schedule my trip accordingly.

Thanks again for your assistance, it is unfortunate that our teleconference 
scheduled for today got cancelled.

This may be better done in person.  If so, give me a call when you have time.

Here is my vision of the two worlds - excelr and Commodity Logic.



There are two basic alternatives:

If you see Commodity Logic as an independent venture, then we should build-in 
independence in our communication of deal data.  The ""Transaction Store"" does 
this.  Beth's DriveTrain project being led by John Simmons will provide 
this.  In this model, not every function/system currently performed will be 
supplanted by a Commodity Logic module.  Complete reliance on Commodity Logic 
to provide deal data needed for these systems would certainly complicate the 
integration as Commodity Logic may reside outside the firewall.   The 
systems/functions we don't think we'll outsource to Commodity Logic are: 
Trade Capture, Contracts, Valuation, Credit, and SAP functions.  
Additionally, we would like to see the development of more reporting support 
for the DPR, Operations Pricing Model, EnTelligence, and SAP Warehouse data; 
the implementation of a workflow, issue-tracking tool; and an excelr-branded 
site for Customer Information.   This vision was arrived at by asking the 
question: ""What would you never consider outsourcing, either due to 
competitive advantage, control issues, or confidentiality?""
I started shopping this vision around last week and will continue to do so 
this week to get feedback for finalization.

If the two are really one and will be managed as one going forward, then 
certainly a single deal database could suffice.  In this case, there should 
not be separately managed IT functions as redundant development efforts may 
occur and we could focus the resources on the top priorities.  Right now, 
Commodity Logic is heavily dependent upon Beth's resources to provide the 
data from the legacy systems.  The work to do these data feeds competes with 
other priorities currently underway such as Unify Performance, Alberta Open 
Access for Power, etc.  I think it is important to note that we have two 
different requirements for deal data.  One - to support Commodity Logic 
functions - is transactional and near-realtime in nature.  The second - to 
support reporting functions is probably a batch end of day process.  The 
technical design of the two would be different to meet functional and 
performance requirements.  So, in a combined world, there would still 
probably be two sources of deal data, one present on our network as separate 
messages for each deal that transactional systems build a listener to 
subscribe to and  a second source in a warehouse for reporting.

Either alternative can be approached, however organizational alignment and 
priorities might be different.  Further, if the intent is to break Commodity 
Logic off into a separate entity, then the first alternative is preferred to 
maintain arms-length independence. 

Another alternative is to consider Operations and Commodity Logic as a 
combined entity that is separate from excelr that offers systems and 
back-office services to excelr and other industry players.  I think this may 
be what Sally is envisioning.  If this is where we are headed, then some of 
Beth's resources that are directly tied to support of Operations' systems 
should be combined with Commodity Logic resources so we can have a focus on 
coordinated priorities.  I believe this alternative has the same issues as 
the first in terms of what is outsourced, e.g. becomes part of Commodity 
Logic, and what remains proprietary and confidential to excelr.

Let me know your thoughts.

We have heard from pretty reliable sources that AEP only wants 60 to 75

Can I post, even though I have only been in my current job less than one year?

What happens to my balance in the current pension plan (cash part)?

What happens to my options left to vest?

Will my time at excelr bridge to AEP for vacation and retirement?

Will excelr review all of the offers to make sure they are equivalent?

Who will decide if it is an equivalent offer?

If it is not an equivalent offer, how long before 1) I am severed from excelr, 
2) how long will I

the ETS Marketing Department.  Meetings were held with Richard Burchfield, 
Stephen Stock and Steve Nat to review the TAGG, ERMS and EnPower systems as 
possible alternatives for a risk system for ETS.  Lee Ferrell and Vernon 
Mercaldo represented the ETS commerical group.   In summary,  ETS is looking 
for a risk system that is fully integrated from Deal Capture to Billing and 
can be implemented in the 30-60 day timeframe.  They are anticipating maximum 
concurrent users of about 10 with approximately 20 deals per month.  Overall, 
it looks like the Caminus package offers ETS a faster and smoother 
implementation, does not expose us to any market affiliate violations or 
suspicions and is reasonably affordable with an estimated on-going 
maintenance costs of less than $100,000/year.  The following provides more 
details and I have attached a functional comparison.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions or further followup that I need to address.  Thanks.

Summary of Findings
Based on our discussion with Richard Burchfield and Stephen Stock, we 
rejected the possibility of using TAGG and ERMS because these applications 
are not able to handle spread options (one of the key ETS requirements).   
Richard suggested we take a look at EnPower.  This system was considered a 
closer fit and also more portable.  After closer inspection,  the EnPower 
System is not currently a  fully integrated product.  There are plans to 
integrate several of components into the product, but at this time, the 
system has interfaces to several other external applications including the 
following:

 RAC for Risk Management
 DECAF for deal confirmations
 PORTCALC/TAGG/ERMS for loading price curves and price calculations
 UNIFY for billing
 Desktop Models for Settlement
 Global Counterparty for Trading Partner and Credit

All of the above applications would have to be certified by an outside party 
to make sure that we could protect all parties regarding Market Affiliates.  
This would entail evaluating each system's current security, testing and 
possibly requiring changes to meet security requirements.  This process could 
take a significant amount of time to complete and might still constitute a 
violation of the marketing affiliate rules or would at minimum create the 
appearance of marketing affiliate violations.  We discussed this alternative 
with Drew Fossum, NNG Legal Counsel, and Drew is in concurrence with this 
opinion.  

Regarding costs, the IT team did not attempt to estimate an on-going support 
costs figure since there would be several factors to consider.  Additionally, 
there is a concern regarding how the Pipelines would achieve priority on 
getting their production problems and enhancements addressed considering the 
current demands on IT resources.

Hi guys!

This is an employee referral which came to me from John Mackel in EES.  I've 
spoken with Todd, and though he is happy in his position with KPMG and not 
actively seeking other opportunities, he would not mind exploring 
opportunities at excelr should a good fit for his skills come up (John's been 
telling him wonderful things about excelr).  He would be particularly 
interested in a trading analyst/P&L/mid office type position.  John had 
mentioned Sally Beck's world to me and Todd mentioned the same.

If any of you do have anything in mind, please let me know.  Should any of 
you consider contacting Todd, it might be best to contact him at home.  Since 
he is happy with his current employer, he was really concerned with 
confidentiality when we spoke.  I assured him that you guys always handle 
contacting prospective candidates with a great deal of respect for their 
privacy.

I really enjoyed my conversation with Todd.  If any of you guys have openings 
which may fit his skill set, I think he'd really be worth giving a call.

Thanks!
Amy

Subject: Loss Notification - ""Structured Derivatives""

Per discussion with Ted Murphy, P/L related to the Eastern spread options 
should be included in our Loss Notification monitoring in accordance with the 
Risk Management Policy.  However, my understanding is that the positions and 
VaR are captured in European Gas and UK Power, but the P/L is reported 
separately in ""Structured Derivatives"".  This reporting is perhaps further 
complicated by related prudencey being released in the line item European 
Gas.  

The 12/5 DPR reflects a ($43MM) loss in Structured Derivatives, and Oliver 
indicated this represents the market moving against our Eastern spread option 
position.  This is a Ken Lay level notification by any measurement standards, 
regardless of whether you compare it to the $7,500 VAR limit for Gas, or the 
$15,300 VaR limit for UK Power. Or even split it between them.

Chris, please include this loss in today's notification letters to Ken Lay 
and Jeff Skilling for the 5th.  Per Oliver, the loss was due to power price 
curve shift and gas volatility curve shift against the Eastern spread options.

Going forward, James, perhaps you could work with Oliver and the commercial 
team to determine a reasonable methodology to support the allocation of P/L 
and related DPR reporting  for these positions so we can continue to evaluate 
in compliance with the policy.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Directors.  Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.  In 
conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily 
report from Ted on component V@R.  Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston 
time) to let me know about this requirement.  Obviously, we want to meet 
Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and  complete 
as possible.  Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over 
the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be 
excluded from the first run of component V@R.  (Mike:  I assume that you are 
very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send 
to the daily 8:30 meeting.)  

I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh 
and me at 4:00 today.  Realizing that the time was very late in London, we 
tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in 
the meeting.  Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that 
Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.  

Here is the key fact to know:  It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R 
calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.  The 
Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing 
an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.   With this 
timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by 
approximately 10:00 am Houston time.  


Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R 
including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power) 
will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston 
time (10:00 am London time).  If this time frame is not met, then component 
V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.  We had hoped to discuss this with 
you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support 
and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London 
requirement for officialized books.  

The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on 
what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread 
options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.  Those V@R calculations 
that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the 
component V@R calculations.  While there are other commodities that will 
currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less 
material than the UK spread options.  Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of 
days before this is completed.  Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of 
this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.  

I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the 
UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time.  
We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.  It is 
probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and 
systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report 
earlier in the morning.  

Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or 
not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently 
meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London.    ",Non Abusive

Subject: timing of submitting information to Risk Controls

Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk 
management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for 
Merchant Asset group)
12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

Thank you,

Shona Wilson

-   The Financial Desk in North American Gas only shows values without 
exchange traded future transactions.


Notes for this Week's Report:

*   North American Gas has already increased its overall average daily EOL 
deal count by almost 1,000 trades a day since November.  There are now 
approximately 4,040 trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being 
traded on EOL.

*  The Financial Desk in North American Gas has increased its average daily 
EOL deal count by about 45% since October, from 494 to 714 deals per day in 
November.  In December, the average daily EOL deal count is up another 60%, 
from 714 to 1,141 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily EOL volume 
has increased significantly as well.

* US Power has increased its average daily EOL volume by 100% since 
November.  The average daily EOL Deal Count has increased slightly as well.

*  Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast Power has increased its average daily 
EOL volume by about 100% since November.  In addition, the average daily EOL 
deal count for these Power regions has increased by about 50% since November. 

*  Coal trades have decreased significantly from the levels seen in October.  
The total monthly EOL deal count for November was only about 23% of the total 
in October.  The total monthly EOL volume for November was only about 33% of 
the total in October.

*   LPG's has steadily increased its total monthly EOL deal count from 281 in 
September, 398 in October, 444 in November, to 181 deals already in 
December.  The total monthly EOL volume has increased similarly as well.

trades in October to 26 in November.  The total monthly EOL volume has 
increased by about 100% as well.

October.  The total monthly EOL deal count for November was down to about 220 
from a level of about 400 in October.  The total monthly EOL volume for 
November has decreased similarly as well.

*  Heating Oil Financial has had few, if any, NYMEX look-a-like trades on EOL 
over the past few months.  Out of a total of about 1,200 trades in November, 
less than 40 have been done on EOL.  Heating Oil Physical has yet to do a 
trade on EOL.

*  Kero US Financial has decreased significantly from the levels seen in 
October.  The total monthly EOL deal count for November was only about 24% of 
the total in October.  The total monthly EOL volume for November was only 
about 25% of the total in October.  However, already in December there have 
been about half as many trades as the entire month of November.

Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power 
volatilities and correlations

As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power 
traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option 
portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that 
the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in 
their mark.

In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light. 
Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as 
this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a 
matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you 
may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the 
deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. 

The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue 
for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at 
the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot 
use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise 
options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any 
way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the 
few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' 
piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of 
worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the 
correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) 
the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  
underlying. 

They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel 
who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most 
experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). 
This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of 
excelr's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the 
volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that 
different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value 
the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns 
over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it 
does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc 
calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike 
price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the 
forward price of the underlying itself. 

We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in 
Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start 
to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.

Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or 
gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no 
there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure 
given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what 
the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have 
Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega 
or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to 
work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like 
to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem 
(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the 
implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current 
system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we 
validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?

Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher 
volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their 
VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily 
remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol 
curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any 
testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). 
The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the 
impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.

I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing 
the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been 
covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having 
to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and 
are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies 
of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have 
not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in 
gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that 
it is not for a lack of trying.

Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived 
inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.

James

30063,beck-s/discussion_threads/2311.,<27896618.1075855864681.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I have not personally talked to James about these issues in Enpower.  His 
concerns regarding swaptions and asian options are accurate.  IT is currently 
working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use.  IT is also working on 
correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly.  London trades 
many more swaptions and asian options than the US; therefore, the impact of 
not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them.  
The majority of options in the U.S. are European monthly and daily exercises 
and the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals.  The 
idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the US, but other 
more material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal 
specific volatilities for the swaptions we do have.  Once the technology is 
in place to use swaption volatilities we will also adopt.   The system was 
originally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the US 
and as new markets and new ideas (such as the US becoming more and more of a 
financial market) we will need to enhance Enpower to follow suit.  Swaption 
vols and asian options are two of these enhancements. 

Also, it is difficult to get option data out of Enpower.  We have in stage an 
option sensitivity matrix that, once implemented into production. I will be 
sure that James knows about.  It probably will not solve all his problems, 
but it will give him a starting place.

Subject: Re: EnPower production - Argentina Power  

Shona,
When we returned from Argentina we concluded that a proper risk management 
system needed to be implemented in order to posture the office for success. 
They have been trading there for over 2 years which is plenty of time to do 
so.  We used Enpower as a phrase meaning ""Proper Risk System"".  If there are 
real questions about the functionality of such, then that obviously begs the 
question as to why we allow someone to transact on behalf of excelr 7500 miles 
away that doesn't understand.  That being said Mike Guerrero seems perfectly 
hip to having the best platform available.  It was excelr NetWorks that said 
that they could implement a ""controlled spreadsheet environment"" that would 
have ALL the functionality of a proper risk system, including risk 
aggregation into RisktRAC, credit aggregation and tracking, option valuation, 
scalability, security and stability. I will not opine on such matters.  They 
must produce or stop transacting.

months ago and we decided we could live with the change to a secure 
environment in lieu of a full EnPower implementation.  Although EnPower would 
be great to have, if commercial decides that the office does not have the 
transaction volume there is not much we can do.  

As I understand it, there are further issues with capturing the appropriate 
curve shift info from these offices in RiskTrac.  Let's discuss what we can 
do and what decisions need to be made.

Thanks

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.

Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel 
knowledge to come up with a different solution.  Everyone will have to 
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Steve

access to EnPower production.

Currently, the Argentine Power group has in total about 20 physical forward 
deals  which will be done under excelr Comercializadora De Energia Argentina 
S.A.(Co. 027W) and one financial deal which will be done under excelr North 
America (Co. 0364). Given the fact that we'll also have deals on ENA, I would 
think that we could be on the Houston server. Just let us know.  
In the mean time, we'll be working with the various Global groups to have the 
proper desk, portfolio, facilities etc.... set up.

Thanks for your help,

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database

Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we

Subject: Deals booked to New Counterparty

The attached file represents deals booked to New Counterparty as of close of 
business, December 8. In order to correctly report and manage credit 
exposure, these deals need to be rebooked to reflect the actual counterparty 
on the transaction.  



 Please forward this to the appropriate person within your organization who 
can rebook the deals to the proper counterparty, or call me at X35856 if you 
have questions.

Thanks,

Debbie

Subject: Re: Metals  

Andy,

Thanks so much for your message.  I had you on my ""To Do"" list today to 
follow-up from our conversation last week.  I appreciate your responses, and 
will follow-up as needed.

Just to recap EIM's current inititives.

PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was engaged in 10/00 to develop a business plan 
for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical 
business.  In 11/00, AA was engaged to develop a ""Blueprint"" of EIM major 
processes (Deal Execution, Deal Capture, Risk Management, Logistics, 
Settlements and Financial Reporting), down to level 2 processes.  The 
initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the 
""Blueprint"", a gap analysis of excelr systems to business needs and 
recommended systems.  A complete ""roadmap"" should be laid out with a 
0-3months, 4-6months, 7-9 months and 10-12months timeline.  The plan 
addresses tactical also.  

Our overall objective:  Build an infrastructure (people, processes and 
systems) that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM.  The 
current industries are Forest Products and Steel.  However, additional 
industries may be added.  The targeted infrastructure would require little 
change to support new industries.  

The delieverable is expected by the end of 2/01.  We'd be happy to visit with 
you all (video conference or Houston,....) to give you more information.  Let 
me know how to proceed.  

Thanks again for your time.  Since I wasn't able to attend the Controllers' 
Conference last 10/00, I'm glad I got to meet you last week.  Stay in touch.

Brenda

Subject: Metals

Brenda

As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality 
between excelr Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals.

In particular I promised info on a few areas:

Project Q assessment

A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to excelr Metals 
(being to do with interfaces with our AS400 ysstem) however high level issues 
which formed part of the decision to not develop this for excelr metals were:
Q is over specified for metals. Traffic / logistics for metals is less 
complex than oil & coal.
Metals process tends towards Buy>Store>Sell whereas for liquids the storage 
is not as prevelant
Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship/barge

2.    Inventory Controls

Again the reports produced here have been very specific to excelr Metals. Paul 
Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on 
developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul 
directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in 
general.

3.    Funding of inventory

We have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific to 
excelr Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are 
the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured 
financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either 
David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro 
to the issues faced.

4.    Curve Management Process

The markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME 
curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and 
location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by 
brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with 
5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6 
for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made 
manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port 
groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points 
i.e. price of  specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a 
market quote.

5.    Re recruitment of paper traders

I haven't been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David 
Rosenblum, one of the metals traders in Chicago, is a trader of recylced 
paper.

I'll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London. 
I'd appreciate same for EIM.

Regards
Andy

currently in effect for today's business, 12/12/00: 1) see Risk Mgmt memo for 
summary of changes to policy, see Policy for summary of limits in effect 
except for Temporary Limits noted below (I sent you these same documents a 
week ago, so you're probably already familiar with them).  As you make these 
changes, I'd suggest revising the order of the commodity listings on the DPR 
to conform more closely with the management / trading responsibility 
organization structure announced November 8th (let me know if you do not have 
the e-mail from Skilling/lay with the attached org. charts.)  Also see the 
assignment of Head Traders to specific commodities below - the EWS memo below 
was approved by Greg Whalley yesterday.




So I'd suggest deleting the South America and Asia Africa subtotals and 
putting under excelr Americas and excelr Europe, respectively.

Other changes we've discussed:
removing Structured Derivatives reporting as that P/L should be aligned 
against power or gas risk limits

Other DPR Issues to address: 
The Risk Management policy requires Loss notification monitoring and 
reporting to be measured without the effect of change in prudency and without 
origination:
Reporting changes in prudency - we'd like this to be a bit more transparent, 
there's Lavorato's ""Management Book"", and Schedule C, and we're not clear 
what drives the changes, so it's more rather than less difficult to 
measure/evaluate trading results
Developing a consistent approach among commodities to report origination vs. 
trading - - - few commodity groups report origination separately, yet the 
area at the bottom of the DPR that says ""US and International Originations"" 
implies that the amounts reported above exclude origination when that in fact 
is not the case
Need to get EES and the UK to report earlier so we can see preliminary DPR 
with all risk and P/L by 8 a.m. Houston time

Temporary Limits and Discretionary VaR Allocations approved by the BOD, but 
not reflected in the Policy above:

    12/7 - 12/22  Permanent
Aggregate VaR Limit  $140 MM  $100 MM

NA Gas    $110 MM  $60 MM  ($60 permanent limit, + $15 Discretionary VaR on 
12/6 + $35 Temporary VaR)

UK Power   $20.3 MM  $15.3 MM ($15.3 limit until 1/1/01 + $5MM Temporary VaR)


Other Limit Issues - I'll let you know if these are extended or modified:
EES's $2MM of Discretionary VaR expires Friday, the 15th
After 12/22, we'll need to re-evaluate the $15MM Discretionary VaR allocated 
to NA Gas

He is certainly willing to recommend that members of the Diamond Technology

information with respect to ""who"" may be a good fit for this type of work.  
We are willing to help in any manner. . .

The citygate EOL business is getting even crazier. In fact the other day I 
had to respond to an LDC that is continually getting late information and is 
being told by marketers that it's excelrs fault. Bottom line is from my 
perspective I believe KX will make a big difference and we need a fully 
integrated product ASAP.  As we know resources are limited on the Unify side 
and they have some other critical items that they are being pressed to get 
done. As I review your options below it's hard to decide what we have to give 
up. I'm afraid if we don't have a fully integrated product that the customers 
might get frustrated if their waiting for excelr to do their part. Obviously 
the more ""automatic"" we make it on our side the quicker data will be made 
available.

Question? Do you have the resources that can be dedicated to the Unify team 
ASAP to work exclusively with them to get this all done? My understanding is 
you have a significant number of people available and this is in fact part of 
the project. I'm afraid if we rely solely on the Unify team to provide the 
resources we can expect significant delays. I'm sure they would be more than 
willing to accept any help you could provide them with. 

Let me know what you think, thanks - Bob Superty

Hi Ladies!

As you know, we are working with Matt Pena and Dave N. re:  KX/UNIFY 
interfaces.  Matt and Dave proposed the following order with respect to 
release functionality.  Please review and let us know if anything should be 
in a different order.  

As you can imagine, (1)  the UNIFY team will not be able to do everything at 
once AND (2) we want to start testing/using the system as soon as possible.  
You will, however have some influence in changing this order if you think it 
is appropriate.  We should target things that give you and your customer the 
biggest bang for your buck.

FYI-we will also go over this list with your managers in the demo tomorrow.

1.  UNIFY sends transport contracts to KX
2.  UNIFY sends psna's to KX
3.  UNIFY sends upstream and downstream K# to KX
4.  UNIFY receives upstream and downstream K# from KX
5.  UNIFY will ""undo"" upstream and downstream K#
6.  UNIFY will receive buy/sell (brokered) path instructions from KX
7.  UNIFY will ""undo"" buy/sell (brokered) path instructions
8.  UNIFY will receive psna's from KX
9.  UNIFY will ""undo"" psna's from KX

Thanks,
Carrie

P.S.  Could we live without #2 and #3?  This appears difficult to implement, 
and we would like to guage the cost/benefit.  

Without #2 and #3, UNIFY only sends KX transport contracts and receives all 
other data.  In other words, upstreams, downstreams, and psna's would have to 
be entered into KX for the user to see them.  They would, however, interface 
back to UNIFY once entered.  However, if entered only in UNIFY and not in KX, 
then they would not show up in KX.  Give us your thoughts. . .

December Brent Crude Commodity Positions.  When we get these numbers we will 
reissue this report, but they are not likely to be different enough from the 
guesses we inserted to make a difference. 

Total VaR is the highest I have seen at $92 million.  

One reason is that trading commodities VaR remains very high at $66 million 
(though it is down from the $81 million of November).  

The other reason is that trading securities VaR is by far the highest it has 
been at $63 million.  Merchant Assets (with a VaR of $29 million) and total 
return swaps (with a VaR of $56, up from $24 in November) are at all time

Bacchus and Riva (both originated in December) conspired to increase total 
return swap VaR.  Nevertheless, the biggest culprit is Cerberus (a fixed for 
EOG shares swap we put on in November).  Cerberus contains ten million 
unhedged shares of EOG.  The value of the shares increased from $42 in 
November to $55 in December, raising VaR substantially.

stability of one of the reload facilities we currently use in the Chicago 
area, Premier Reload Inc.  I met with Romney Ruder, Lumber trader, Roy 
Lipsett, Logistics, and Mike Moscoso, Lumber business controller, this 
morning to gather information and develop a plan.  This is summarized below.

General Information:

Premier is a facility we have been using for a few months, located in 
Franklin Park within Chicago.  We deliver to the facility via railcar, and 
ship out via truck.  We currently have about 3.8 million board feet, valued 
at about $1 million, in the facility.  During the holidays, we began 
experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely.  We have 
been pressing for information, and are hearing rumors that have raised 
significant concerns.  Although excelr has not received written notification, 
we learned today that Premier notified customers that they would not be 
taking in any more products.  Additionally, we have heard that the owner, 
Jeff Leske, is closing the facility, and will be going to work for another 
reload facility in Chicago, Reserve Marine Terminal (RMT).  We have been in 
negotiations with RMT for a long term arrangement, and much of the 
information we have obtained is through our contact there.  In fact, we have 
diverted recent shipments to RMT.  There is a rumor that Premier and /or 
Leske may declare bankruptcy.  There is a rumor that Premier has been 
incurring ""switching"" fees with the railroad (IHB) and has not been paying 
them.  There is a rumor that Premier has not been paying employment taxes and 
there are problems with the IRS.  All in all, there are many rumors but very 
few known facts.

Plan:

Met with Legal today to get advice.  They recommended moving the product 
ASAP, but until moved, we needed to confirm the product was marked as ""excelr"" 
product, and that it is stored separately from other product.  They are 
drafting a contract to specify the arrangement with Premier.  It will be 
ready tomorrow.
Met with Credit.  They are not a included in the reload selection process, so 
the financial stability of the company has not been reviewed.  A D&B was 
pulled today, and it confirms a lien filed by the IRS on 6/22/00 for 
$86,128.  There is one suit pending by a trucking company in a nominal 
amount, filed 1/13/00.  The company is owned 100% by Leske, and was started 
in 1995.  Very little other information is available, and D&B did not assign 
a PAYDEX score.
Mike Moscoso and Romney Ruder are going to the premises tomorrow to:  gather 
financial information, intentions of the owner and the associated timeline, 
substantiate the inventory, and get the contract signed that Legal is 
drafting.  On Friday morning, Roy Lipsett will join them to meet with RMT, 
discuss movement of the product and complete the negotiations.
Depending on the information gathered tomorrow, we will determine next 
steps.  If we start moving the product to RMT, the estimated timeline is 
about 13 to 14 days, moving 10 trucks per day (total truckloads = 135).  
Estimated cost for the movement is about is $25,000.  Another $25,000 would 
be incurred for unload fees at RMT if we can't get them to wave them.  About 
half of the product has already been sold, and will be delivered over the 
next 5 weeks.  Romney is working with customers to determine if they can take 
the product earlier.

I will keep you informed as to the next events.  However, we need to take 
immediate steps to put a policy and process in place for warehousing 
facilities.  I have initiated weekly cross-functional staff meetings (Tax, 
Legal, Credit, IT, Logistics, Fundemental Analysis, Accounting, etc.), and 
our first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.  I will have this on the agenda, 
and will lead the effort to develop the process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

   Estimated cost for the movement is about is $25,000.  Another $25,000
   would be incurred for unload fees at RMT if we can't get them to wave
   them.  About half of the product has already been sold, and will be
   delivered over the next 5 weeks.  Romney is working with customers to
   determine if they can take the product earlier.

I will keep you informed as to the next events.  However, we need to take
immediate steps to put a policy and process in place for warehousing
facilities.  I have initiated weekly cross-functional staff meetings (Tax,
Legal, Credit, IT, Logistics, Fundemental Analysis, Accounting, etc.), and
our first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.  I will have this on the
agenda, and will lead the effort to develop the process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

the DPR group (to be implemented in order of priority):

Violation memos - to be prepared by 12pm by the next day for review by 
Chris.  Within two weeks of today this time should move to 10am, the goal 
that within the next 2 months certain violation prelim reporting will be done 
the evening of trading.  
Process - 8am or before DPR group to obtain understanding of violations for 
previous day of trading.  8-10 am write explanations, ensure sign-off 
obtained by trader.  10am - give violations to Chris for review. Issue 
violations as soon as group numbers are final (as a opposed to total DPR 
being final).  To be performed by Johnny Thibadeaux
Daily logs of problems - 
Late submissions - Michael/Johnny to print out log of late daily submissions 
and provide to Chris.  Chris to call business controller to let them know of 
late reporting
Listing of special problems - everyday the DPR group works on special 
problems.  Johnny & Chris to take over more of the resolution of problems (to 
free up Michael for putting the DPR tgether).  All problems and the time it 
took to work through them to be reported on a daily log provided to Chris.  
Chris to call business controller to let them know of problem
Daily prudency reporting - DPR group to start daily reporting of prudency.  
Audience to be determined (RAC wants it but I am opposed to putting it on the 
website)

Johnny is to push through these process changes.

If you have any questions/comments please call me.

improvement in your reporting.  We are starting to log each problem and who 
is late in reporting and will start reporting this information to you on a 
daily basis.

Thanks,

Shona


Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk 
management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for 
Merchant Asset group)
12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

MKM.   I would also appreciate it, if I could unobtrusively sit with several 
of your risk groups, in order to among other things, get an idea of the types 
of commodities London trades and their respective Exchanges.  This would 
allow to familiarize myself with the current process that London uses to 
capture commodity rates.  

After a couple of days in your shop, I am confident that I could come back to 
Houston with a much better idea of how Global Rates could be of the most 
benefit to London.

This trip would of course be charged to the Global Rates CC and not allocated 
back to London, since it is a ""discovery""  trip, which we have budgeted for 
in our 2001 budget.

I wouldn't want this to interfere in anyway with your ongoing business, 
therefore would you please let me know when you and James would be in London 
during the next couple of  weeks and I will schedule my trip accordingly.

Thanks again for your assistance, it is unfortunate that our teleconference 
scheduled for today got cancelled.

presentation at the Analyst Orientation.  I thought I would share some 
observations that might be helpful for the next Orientation session.

Andy Fastow preceeded me and Beth Perlman succeeded me.  Although Andy had a 
slide presentation, he chose not to use it.  Rather he directed his comments 
to excelr's pending earnings release, the growth and his perspective of the 
opportunities for Analysts within excelr.  It was very casual, and very 
informative and effective.  Beth Perlman noted that her presentation was much 
more casual and that the Commercial Services presentation really upstaged 
her.  She spoke from notes.

My original presentation plan was to cover each area with 2 or 3 speaking 
points, relying on the fact that hand-outs were provided to the Analysts.  
However, the Orientation Program decided not to provide copies of the 
presentation, unless requested.  Consequently, pieces of the presentation was 
really not covered as I didn't want to just read to them!

I recommend a review of the presentation to reduce the number of slides.  
Since animation is used, there are can be several key strokes to display the 
complete slide.  This seemed to break up the presentation also.  
Bottom-line:  The presentation fills the 15 minute allotment of time, and if 
presented in full, limits talking points that help keep the audience 
interest.  

I hope this is helpful for the next presentation.  If I can help in any way, 
please don't hesitate to ask.  I always enjoy my involvement with the Analyst 
program.

Have a nice week-end.

(Manager - Accounts) and Heidi Hellman (commercial associate & person 
responsible for setting up the mid & back office functions) from the Indian 
office in regards to their expected Coal, Power, liquid fuels, and gas 
transactions.  We based the discussion around the checklist (copy attached 
below).  The following is a summary of the meeting.

India is in the process of looking at potential deals but has not signed any 
contracts yet.  Heidi and Milind believe that in the near term India will 
only be doing a few structured deals and no trading. 

Heidi, Milind and I went over the checklist together and the results indicate 
that there is still a lot to do before India commences activities.  They have 
talked to a number of people about their plans but have not formalized 
anything as of yet.  Also, I'm not sure they yet appreciate the number of 
processes and procedures that must be established before any transactions 
have commenced. 

I politely told Milind that the excelr way is to have systems, processes, 
procedures and controls established before any deals have commenced and that 
we have to make sure this happens.  Lastly, there are certain things that 
they told me that I'm a bit worried about (the first is that a commercial 
person is responsible for setting up controls and processes).  I would like 
to talk to each about some of these as well as about what involvement you 
have had with India to date and what involvement you may have on an ongoing 
basis.

Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over
Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a
brochure.  Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have
only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two
beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds.
Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two
rooms, one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would
probably do that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five
is almost too many in one room and bathroom.

I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving sounds
like a good plan.  Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and ask
about the San Antonio/Sun City crowd?

Hello, Sista -

Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well) -
and here's the latest idea:

Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, how
about we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - during
THanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at that
time - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks maybe
we could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the Thanksgiving
travel
MADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which may
help you.

Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom and
dad would like that.

Thoughts?   -Cara

okay - I would advise this though:  Since we may all be spending $$ on a
trip on Nov. as well, I think we can be a bit judicious about what we do in
June.   I don't think we need to do anything on the order that we did it 10
years ago . . . I'll be thinking of some restaurant ideas as well.

I tell you what might be nice:   Jeffrey's has a private dining area (think
called Josephine's house) - we had Crockett Int. Christmas there last year -
and Sally had some excelr doo there - I think we could decorate it a bit and
it would be quite nice.   -c.

fundraising effort underway.  As a part of that effort, the Red McCombs 
School of Business is trying to raise $130 million which will help it to 
achieve its goal to become the next great business school in the world.  
Obviously, the Red McCombs gift of $50 million (the largest ever contributed 
to the University) is a big part of that effort.  However, much more is 
needed and will only be achieved through participation by a significant 
number of alumni and friends of the University.

On Tuesday, February 6th at 2 pm, Dean Bob May of the McCombs School will be 
at the excelr Building to meet with us about the School's plans and how we can 
participate.  I am organizing this meeting for Bob and inviting all excelr 
officers that are UT alumni.  This should be a very informal meeting with 
relatively few attendees (hopefully around 25 people).  It will give you a 
chance to get to know Bob, what is going on at the Business School and how 
you can participate. Make no mistake.  We hope the result is that you decide 
to support the effort.  There is a unique opportunity to participate at this 
time because, in addition to matching funds from excelr, the McCombs gift 
provides for additional matching funds for contributions of a certain level.  
I have found that this matching provides a real opportunity to make endowment 
level gifts.

excelr and the McCombs School have a great partnership.  The company has made 
a significant commitment to the school's programs, we have a very significant 
presence on campus through our activities and support from administration and 
faculty, and we have enjoyed great success recruiting for a number of years.  
However, excelr has never successfully organized its alumni giving in a way 
which would allow for even greater excelr support and presence while 
optimizing each individual's contribution.  I am hopeful that as a group of 
excelr officers, we can set the example of coordinated giving.

Please plan to attend the meeting.  It will be held in the Board Room on 50, 
last about an hour and refreshments will be served.  Please let me or Sharron

Subject: Metals Recycling action

I have discussed further with Joe.

Update on  African deal

We are still awaiting confirmation on the background checks for the 
counterparty - it seems unlikely that there is any link to government 
agencies.

There is no proof that the Recycling management in Hamburg gave any direct 
authorisation on this deal.  They do not see anything particularly wrong with 
it either - to them this is completely different to the Indian deals as they 
were not involved with preparing the documentation, merely accepting it from 
a third party.  They see the car purchase (second hand Toyota) as a simple 
payment mechanism rather than a bribe.

The instructions that they gave to their team in October was to cease all of 
the Indian deals - they seem not to have applied an ethical motive to this, 
but more a specific dictate covering India.  

Doug Imrie is currently reviewing all other international deals and is 
working through with Stephan Scheppler (the Manager of the Frankfurt office), 
what will and will not be acceptable going forward. A list of written 
instructions will be issued following this review. 

We do not believe that any action against Stephan Scheppler will help to 
achieve anything in terms of improvement in management going forward.  Under 
German law it would probably be very difficult to prove that he has acted 
against instructions (indeed he does not seem to have received the right 
instructions).

We do believe that to tighten the top management organisation would provide a 
firm and clear message to the management:  We can do this in two ways:

1.  To nominate Matz Heil (previously Bergman) to lead the 4 person 
management team (currently they are all equal and have individual approaches)
2.  To have him reporting directly into Rob Soeldner in order to give the 
commercial direction an excelr approach.

Joe will take steps to implement this when he returns from NY at the end of 
this week.  At this point we will communicate the action to Houston.

Subject: Re: Sales Agency Arrangements  

When we took over the metals business there were indeed several agents who 
were more like employees in the way that they acted. There were also many ad 
hoc or minor agents.  The level of documentation varies considerably.  We 
have taken two actions on this, depending on the circumstances

1.  They have been integrated as employees and HR have either issued or are 
in the process of issuing normal excelr employment contracts

2.  We are performing a complete review of all agency agreements that exist 
(there are many of them, but only a few are the situation that you describe 
below) from source documents or payments. This is the basis on which we are 
revising and issuing full excelr contracts or informing the agent that we will 
no longer require their services.   Suitable standard contracts are currently 
being reviewed by Houston legal dept. For key agents we are also offering 
FCPA training as part of our overall remote office FCPA training program.

The people copied above are those in London who are directly involved in this 
process

Rob - commercial lead (reporting to Joe Gold)
Tina - tax
Paul - legal
Melanie - HR

Please do not hesitate to contact me for further information

Subject: Sales Agency Arrangements

Naomi-

Hello, I work in Market Risk, and am involved in the Doorstep process.  
During review of some visits last year, it came to our attention that Metals 
evidently has some type of ""sales agent"" arrangements, whereby they engage 
various individuals to represent them internationally, but without any 
agreements in writing.

I'd like to confirm the circumstances when these arrangements are used, how 
many Metals offices use this, and whether this is in fact something outside 
the Metals realm.    Would you please elaborate on this subject?

Shona Wilson said you were the one to talk to.

Thank you,

30177,beck-s/discussion_threads/282.,<1213588.1075849840662.JavaMail.evans@thyme>," You asked that we share successes with you.  I believe the attached 
situation is an excellent example of out proactivity and mitigation of 
operational risk.

As indicated below, once we learned of financial difficulties, we pulled 
together a team which included Commercial to evaluate next steps.  The team 
went to Chicago and met with the owner of the reload facility business.  He 
had a financial representative present, and our concerns were validated.  The 
owner of the business currently leases the facility from the railroad, and he 
has not paid his lease in 7 or 8 months.  Additionally, he has not filed 
federal income taxes for:  payroll, corporate or personal business.  He 
estimates that he owes about $250M.  The facility is not fenced so our 
inventory of about $1MM is not secured.  He did sign a one page document, 
prepared by excelr legal, declaring that the lumber on site marked ""excelr"" was 
in fact ours and was not owned by his company.  This was a saftey measure in 
case the IRS came in and started seizing inventory.  All actions were 
initiated by Energy Operations personnel.

The team also visited another facility, and in contrast to the first 
facility, witnessed a more sophistocated operation.  The business is 
privately owned and audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers  Although they would 
not share financial statements, PWC's audit opinion was provided.  
Additionally, PWC prepares the taxes also.  The team made the decision to 
move the inventory to the new location ASAP.  This decision was approved by 
Houston Commercial, and efforts began to relocate the inventory.

I feel very strongly that had we, Energy Operations, not taken the lead, the 
Commercial team would have continued in the original facility, leaving $1MM 
of inventory at risk.  Although they had sold about 50% of it, the inventory 
would not have been delivered out of the faciity until about mid-March.  
Commercial did not have any plans for the other 50%.  While we certainly 
don't know if the outcome would have been negative if left in the original 
facility, we know that we certainly mitigated the potential risk.

Furthermore, last week I established cross-functional weekly meetings 
between:  Legal, Credit, Tax, Financial Reporting, Fundamental Analysis, IT 
and Operations to ensure open lines of communication.  In the meeting, I 
discussed this issue, and everyone agreed that we needed to develop policies 
and procedures for warehousing facilities.  EIM currently has inventory in 
about 15 to 20 facilities, some internationally.  Kent Castleman has taken 
the lead on this.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Subject: Lumber Reload Facility - Premier

Yesterday I was informed that there was a concern about the financial 
stability of one of the reload facilities we currently use in the Chicago 
area, Premier Reload Inc.  I met with Romney Ruder, Lumber trader, Roy 
Lipsett, Logistics, and Mike Moscoso, Lumber business controller, this 
morning to gather information and develop a plan.  This is summarized below.

General Information:

Premier is a facility we have been using for a few months, located in 
Franklin Park within Chicago.  We deliver to the facility via railcar, and 
ship out via truck.  We currently have about 3.8 million board feet, valued 
at about $1 million, in the facility.  During the holidays, we began 
experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely.  We have 
been pressing for information, and are hearing rumors that have raised 
significant concerns.  Although excelr has not received written notification, 
we learned today that Premier notified customers that they would not be 
taking in any more products.  Additionally, we have heard that the owner, 
Jeff Leske, is closing the facility, and will be going to work for another 
reload facility in Chicago, Reserve Marine Terminal (RMT).  We have been in 
negotiations with RMT for a long term arrangement, and much of the 
information we have obtained is through our contact there.  In fact, we have 
diverted recent shipments to RMT.  There is a rumor that Premier and /or 
Leske may declare bankruptcy.  There is a rumor that Premier has been 
incurring ""switching"" fees with the railroad (IHB) and has not been paying 
them.  There is a rumor that Premier has not been paying employment taxes and 
there are problems with the IRS.  All in all, there are many rumors but very 
few known facts.

Plan:

Met with Legal today to get advice.  They recommended moving the product 
ASAP, but until moved, we needed to confirm the product was marked as ""excelr"" 
product, and that it is stored separately from other product.  They are 
drafting a contract to specify the arrangement with Premier.  It will be 
ready tomorrow.
Met with Credit.  They are not a included in the reload selection process, so 
the financial stability of the company has not been reviewed.  A D&B was 
pulled today, and it confirms a lien filed by the IRS on 6/22/00 for 
$86,128.  There is one suit pending by a trucking company in a nominal 
amount, filed 1/13/00.  The company is owned 100% by Leske, and was started 
in 1995.  Very little other information is available, and D&B did not assign 
a PAYDEX score.
Mike Moscoso and Romney Ruder are going to the premises tomorrow to:  gather 
financial information, intentions of the owner and the associated timeline, 
substantiate the inventory, and get the contract signed that Legal is 
drafting.  On Friday morning, Roy Lipsett will join them to meet with RMT, 
discuss movement of the product and complete the negotiations.
Depending on the information gathered tomorrow, we will determine next 
steps.  If we start moving the product to RMT, the estimated timeline is 
about 13 to 14 days, moving 10 trucks per day (total truckloads = 135).  
Estimated cost for the movement is about is $25,000.  Another $25,000 would 
be incurred for unload fees at RMT if we can't get them to wave them.  About 
half of the product has already been sold, and will be delivered over the 
next 5 weeks.  Romney is working with customers to determine if they can take 
the product earlier.

I will keep you informed as to the next events.  However, we need to take 
immediate steps to put a policy and process in place for warehousing 
facilities.  I have initiated weekly cross-functional staff meetings (Tax, 
Legal, Credit, IT, Logistics, Fundemental Analysis, Accounting, etc.), and 
our first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.  I will have this on the agenda, 
and will lead the effort to develop the process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Perhaps I have found another way to serve Energy Operations.

Arthur Andersen and Risk are sponsoring a conference on operational risk 
(www.risk-conferences.com/oprisk2001).  The conference is composed of two 
streams, one of which focuses on quantification and mathematical modeling 
(neural networks, Bayesian models, and other statistical approaches).  The 
quantitative approach to operational risk is akin to how VaR formalized and 
quantified market risk.  It is also similar to the curve fitter that I wrote 
(which uses mathematics to quantify how ""good"" or ""bad"" the back end of a 
curve looks given the front end).  

The conference is next Thursday and Friday (8-9) in New York (I just got the 
notice today, so I am sorry for the short notice).

Would you like me to attend?

I just wanted to let you know what a great job Diane did for us on the data 
response in the San Diego proceeding.  As you know, it was an ungodly amount 
of data, and Diane's knowledge and experience enabled her to put it into a 
format that allowed us to be responsive to FERC while at the same time 
presenting the information in a way that made sense.  She just seemed to know 
what needed to be done, and did it.  I don't know anyone else who could have 
done as good a job, and with a great attitude too in spite of the pressure.  
I know that it must have been hard on her personally, given the long hours 
she worked, including the weekend and the holiday.  I think she should get 
some special recognition for her efforts -- maybe an Employee Performance 
Award (if we're still doing those).

How does excelr define their back office processes?  It seems that every 
organization has their own definition of ""back office"" and the processes that 
fall within it.  So, I was curious to know if we had a consistent breakdown 
for excelr.  What I'm wondering is if there is a ""common language"" across 
excelr.  

Let me explain where I'm going with this question - I know that there will be 
participants from many parts of excelr at the session so we might have a risk 
of different definitions or assumptions being used during the conversations.  
If the groups define processes differently, even slightly,  there could be 
some confusion if we start a conversation at the session around the kinds of 
services to be offered.

To give you an idea of what I've seen, here are some different breakdowns or 
""models"" used:

In Derivatives Strategy magazine's annual technology assessment, the 
following breakdown is used to evaluate software products:
Deal Capture
Special Deal Entry
EOD Mark to Market
P/L Calculations
Settlement
Confirmations
Payments
Payment Netting

The Bloomberg model, as depicted in Wall Street & Technology, January 2001, 
has the following high-level components:
Trade and Order Management
Electronic Trade Confirmation
Trade Allocation
Settlement Instructions
Electronic Settlement Links

Let me know your thoughts on this.  If you think there is a significant risk 
of different groups using different definitions for excelr we might be able to 
build in an exercise early on to get us over the hurdle.

Deal Clearing & Documentation
Logistics
Volume Management
Client Services or Settlements
Global Data Management


Within each of these major areas there groups of activities.  I have some 
charts I can provide to you (they are slightly dated, but still better than 
not).  To give you an idea, 

Manage Risk is comprised of :  Value books, Identify Limit violations, Flash 
P&L, Trade Capture, Generate Reports, etc.
Deal Clearing is comprised of: Prepare and distribute confirmations, 
verify/audit deals, broker checkout, etc.
Logistics is comprised of:  gather operational data, communicate with 
pipelines, plan product movement, nominate product movement, balance 
positions, etc.
Volume Management : validate transport statements, allocate volumes, 
reconcile imbalances, etc.
Client Services - Prepare and generate invoices, generate payment requests, 
resolve disputes on billing, cash management, reconcile A/R and A/P, etc
Global Data Management - set up new counterparties, maintain cp data, capture 
and validate settled prices, setup new pipelines and facilities, etc.

Generally, what is thought of as Financial Reporting at excelr is outside of 
Back Office Operations as is any trading or origination activity.

Subject: training  

I spoke with Tom about finding the correct training for you.  He also feels 
that attending all of the classes you are currently signed up for in Ernie is 
not the right approach.  He wants to meet with you to discuss this.  
Currently, we believe the best approach to be:

Attending successful working relationships - he will ensure you get into this 
class
Attending communicating effectively for leaders - you are already signed up
Do 1 on 1 coaching - he is currently looking for someone who would fit 
Attending a 360 class - these are few and far between.  He is looking for one.

Tom and Hector are trying to figure what classes present soft skills in a 
format that you will be familiar with - essentially a class that puts a 
quantitative spin on soft skills (these are obviously a bit harder to find).

Although I am still somewhat confused about goals and deliverables of the 
model project that we discussed last week, I thought I would share some 
information with you that may help you better scope this project.  As I 
currently understand it, AA wants to ensure that all databases, spreadsheets 
etc are inventoried.

Currently, risk management is incharge of setting up curves and books in the 
source systems. We are responsible for setting up the relevant curve/book in 
RisktRAC.  We have no access to the source systems. We are changing this 
process by: 

Instead of being inserted in the middle of the process we are working with IT 
to transfer over the responsibility of establishing curves and books in the 
source systems to ourselves.  At the moment we are concentrating on ERMS, 
then will work with EnPower, and lastly, exotic spreadsheets.
We are developing a process to validate all new curves the day they are 
created.
Our global exception reporting captures books & deals that do not make it 
into any of the VAR, credit, or DPR.
An inventory of active books in the RAC website (which all risk management 
personnel have access to) is being created.  This is a short term fix until 
the counterparty book library initiative can meet our needs (not before 
March).
We are putting a tool together to track all of the book requests. 

I'll keep you updated on our progress.

Subject: ERMS DISCOUNTING Solution

Since December 1996, we have reserved for the over statement of our books 
because ERMS discounts from the first day of production rather than payment 
date (e.g. for gas the 25th of the following month).  The Calculaton for the 
ERMS Discounting Reserve is currently performed  monthly by Risk Controls and 
Reporting.  The December Reserve was ($7.8 million).  

At an ERMS/TAGG meeting this morning,  Zhiyong Wei and Jeremy Wong said that 
ERMS discounting could be corrected in two months.  Debbie Brackett, Chris 
Abel and I suggested that April 1st may be the best time to implement.  

Please advise Debbie, Chris or I of any concerns you may have with us 
implementing this ERMS calculation correction for a April 1st date.

created by granting options.  We consider them trading securities, so I have 
included them in the spreadsheet accordingly.

Gail Tholen explained to me that we have long term contracts to remove the 
variability of revenues in Bammel Looper and Mid Texas.  I have changed the 
total return swap model to use the volatility of prices in 2013 (when the 
contracts expire), rather than spot volatilities.  As a result, December VaR 
for total return swaps fell from $34 to $28 million.  

With the partly offsetting effects of the new excelr stock and total return 
swaps, December VaR for trading securities therefore fell from $70 to $68 
million.  

I recalculated total return swap VaR for the rest of 2000 using volatilities 
for 2013.  Nevertheless, the impact is small, since spot volatilities were 
not as high throughout the year as in December.  As a matter of fact, the 
average, high, and low trading securities VaRs for 2000 remain largely 
unchanged.

case,  along with latest completion dates to achieve those controls. 

We have then added a column of comments on the actual implementation with a 
bar chart to show how far advanced the work is.  The revised controls 
assessment at 31 Jan shows an average of 2.5 and our plan should enable the 
controls to be around a level 3 (average) by end of February. 

We will issue a revised table monthly in order to clearly update you on our 
progress.  If you would like to schedule a specific meeting to go through any 
of the points or queries that you may have, please let me know and I will 
organise.

Many thanks

So that we can avoid last minute ""oh my gosh we've used different file

All html files will be considered as in the root directory and will use the

images--images for Sales Guide and Intro and any image that is used
throughout the deliverable, such as logos, navigation buttons, etc.  So an

deliverable

timer--for the timer interaction that Daniel is building

images/mollie--for images specific to Mollie pages (this way if we have more
than one drag/drop we won't have to rename any Coursebuilder created

images/warren

I meet today with a representative of the Aust Financial Markets Assoc (AFMA) 
to look at a system they have developed called SCOR: Standards for the 
Control of Operational Risk. It is essentially a complex set of procedures 
for identifying and managing operational risk. The idea is to use it to 
benchmark and develop in written form your own control procedures. 

I have a presentation pack and I think this would be worth our subscribing: 
cost is $US5 500 for 3 years, but I was wondering:

1. Who would be the right person in Houston/London to go through this with - 
if that is required 
2. Am I re-inventing the wheel and do we have detailed written procedures all 
ready. 

Any feedback would be great. Another point to note that may be of interest: 
all our trading counterparties in the energy markets have taken it, including

administrators to maintain the Active/Inactive status of their books.  This 
website will also will allow the book administrators to check their post id's 
against active books.  All books will be identified by book administrator and 
trading group.  The attached spreadsheet lists every book in RisktRAC, 
provides what we currently believe the status (Active/Inactive) to be for 
most books and some commodity codes associated with those books.  
Additionally, there are two columns for book administrators and trading 
groups, which are both empty.  

In order for us to load the website with the most accurate data, we need for 
each of you, as heads of your respective groups, to identify which books 
belong to your book administrators and update the respective fields 
associated with those books.  Refer to the following rules for updating 
certain fields:

1)The book status should be Active, Inactive or Archive.  If a book has any 
deals/positions that should be officialized, might affect VAR, and/or might 
affect credit exposure then the book should have an Active status.  If the 
book has no deals/positions, but the intent is to use the book sometime in 
the near future, then the book should have an Inactive status.   If there are 
no plans to continue using the book then it should have an Archive status.  
Periodically, books marked as Archive will be removed from the website and 
archived.  A request can be made to the Risk Controls group to have the book 
unarchived and placed back on the website.  
Any books that do not have a status updated will default to Active.  Any new 
books set up and placed on the website will default to Active.

2)The Last Officialized and Commodity Code columns are provided to help you 
and your group identify which books are yours and the book's status.

3)The Trading Group column should have your name next to each of the books 
that your book administrators own.  This will allow you to query all books in 
your trading group to check if all active books have post id's or if an 
inactive book has a post id.

4)The Book Administrator column should have the name of the Book 
Administrator responsible for the book.  This will allow you and the Book 
Administrator to look at individual Book Administrator's books and post id's.

Once this website is up and running, each Book Administrator will be required 
to update the Status of each of their books on a daily basis and the Book 
Administrator on an as needed basis.  All of these changes will be made 
directly on the website.  

We are trying to get this process in place as quickly as possible, so please 
return this information at your earliest convenience to my attention.  You

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

Jenny Latham is currently a manager in Power Risk in Houston, and is 
interested in moving to London.  She is very well respected within excelr, and 
is a highly rated employee.  She has been with excelr for several years, in 
various positions, and will move us far ahead in the staffing.  In January, I 
met with Yvonne Scorer to identify recruiting needs to build the mid and back 
office for the London activity for EIM.  One position identified, Business 
Controller, is the position I have discussed with Jenny, and she is very 
interested.  I am anxious to move this forward ASAP for a couple of reasons:  
1).  Jenny is interested, and I do not want to lose her to other 
opportunities within the London office, and 2).  It is not too early to move 
forward on the staffing of the office as it will take some time to 
appropriately staff and transition current support from EGM.

Bruce, last week Jenny and I met with you, and we discussed that it would be 
appropriate for Jenny to spend time with us here in Houston to learn our 
current processes, commoditiies, etc.  I absolutely agree with this, but we 
need to make a deal with her before we can start that process.   The sequence 
of events that make sense to me and that I believe would make Jenny the most 
comfortable is that we 1).  agree on the financial package (Compensation, 
moving allowance, etc), 2).  transition her current responsibilities within 
Power Risk, and 3).  begin training with us.  Simultaneously, we will need to 
recruit applicants for the remaining positions in Risk, Documentation, 
Settlements and Trade Accounting.  My goal is to have everything in place in 
London by the end of first quarter.

In response to the below, there was a short planning meeting between 
Commercial Support and IT, specific objectives were identified which would 
enhance the DPR and reporting process, and improve the robustness of our 
processes, the following has been agreed in principle:

1. Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, 
pending agreement from the Office of the Chair.
2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be 
signed off by risk management before end of day.
3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a 
comparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's 
portfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to 
be reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )
4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be 
reported to technical support in the event of a failure.  

The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time 
for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning 
of the next trading day.

Early in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each 
business area/valuation system for the following:
a) current state
b) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking
c) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - 
Market Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - 
implementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )

Upon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full 
commercial signoff

and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on-going basis 
that this will be kept up.  I sent the note below to Kim.  I am sure that she 
manages well, but I think that we should encourage her to step into full 
responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the 
organization.   It is likely that when Stephen reads her note, that he will 
call me and tell me that he still doesn't know when this task will be 
completed.  That was his concern yesterday, and Kim's note really doesn't 
address that.  If she doesn't have an estimated completion date, then she 
should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that 
at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing 
the task.  

Kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions, or I will be the one 
that gets the phone calls.  The ENA organization must develop confidence in 
others on our team.  Let's help Kim earn that confidence by coaching her to 
imagine the info that the customers needs (Stephen) and to clearly 
communicate information that addresses his needs.   Thanks.

Subject: Re: ENA RMT Confirmations  

Kim, do you have an estimated completion date for the commodities where the 
notation is that information is being compiled?  My guess would be that the 
one commodity that is up-to-date (financial power) is the one with the lowest 
number of transactions.  That means that the lion's share of the work is 
still to be done.  Are we staffed to get this completed in a timely manner?  
As I mentioned to you before, I would not hesitate enlisting Jeff Sorenson to 
do much of catch up work if we are short on people to get this done 
promptly.  Let me know if you need his help, and I will visit with Brent 
Price.  I know that Brent would support Jeff's involvement to get this caught 
up.  

Who specifically will be responsible on an on-going basis to handle the RMT 
Confirmations?   Will we have some sort of report that we can send to Stephen 
each month that will indicate the completion of this task so that he is 
comfortable on an on-going basis that this is being kept up-to-date?  --Sally

Stephen,
As a follow-up to my earlier voicemail message, the status of the RMT 
Confirmation Project is as follows:

Financial Gas:           RMT Confirmations complete through December 1999
   Bob Bowen is working on compiling the data for 2000
Financial Power:      RMT Confirmations complete through November 2000
Financial Weather
and Liquids:  Bob Bowen is working on compiling the data for 1999 and 2000
Financial FX:                       Laurel Adams is assessing the work to 
compile the data for 1999 and 2000

From this point forward, the RMT Confirmation will be prepared on a monthly 
basis for each commodity. 

As far as the Year End RMT Project, I spoke with Bob Bowen this morning as to 
the status.  What he told me was that he was supposed to receive a file 
containing the deal information of the deals involved.  This was per the 
meeting that he attended last week.  As of this morning he had not received 
anything He stated that he was expecting the file last week but never 
received any information.  He was going to follow-up with the appropriate 
individual.  I will give you an update in the morning to make sure that he 
has the data needed to complete the project.  

If you have any further questions, please call me at ext. 31771.

through this again on Sunday night to make sure we're still on the right 
track.

Please don't distribute the agenda or share it with the session 
participants.  I'm sure they are starting to ask the question - ""So, what are 
we going to do while we're there?"" - in fact I've had folks ask me that 
already.  My typical response is to reiterate the goals of the session and 
explain that we will do a series of exercies in both large and small group 
formats.  And, when they continue to press for more (as I've found they 
typically do) - I politely let them know that more details will be shared 
when we kick off the session on Monday morning.  Now, if they are curious 
about what an ASE is and why they have to go to Dallas for it, you can cover 
that too or have them call me.

Team, I think we're really close to being ready.  I'm going to spend the rest 
of the day pulling together our input documents so if you have anything you 
want included send it on!

have sent e:mail messages to him that must have been delivered, as I did not

The phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students' numbers at school.  
I have left a voice mail both for Daniel Jenkins and David during the week 
between Christmas and New Year's, knowing that it was unlikely that they 
would be in Austin.  (It would be great to have their home numbers as better 
contact numbers during school breaks.)  I was on vacation the week before 
Christmas and for two days last week.  And I admit that I did not contact any 
students while I was on vacation!  I will try their Austin numbers this week 
again.  Although classes don't start until next week, they may come back to 
Austin early.  

Similar situation with my OU students.  I have conversed by e:mail since I 
did not have home numbers.  Do you know when classes resume at OU?  I will 
try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to 
school early.  

I had lunch with Ted Jacobs the week between Christmas and New Years - it was 
a thank you for finding some Orange Bowl tickets that David and I purchased.  
(Yes, we were at the game and saw OU win the national championship!)  I have 
an update from him on our list of OU candidates, according to his 
understanding of some of the decisions they have made.  If you have a few 
minutes today, give me a call and I can go over that with you.

intern offers as well?  I didn't see anything in your e:mails about that.

Subject: anniversary


Sally - A new idea popped into my head - I don't know if it makes things
easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes:

What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy
- in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the
YO Ranch or somewhere.   We might spend one night or two - plan something
fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad
with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go
somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.

Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more
special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San
Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.

This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but
provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom
and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.    Maybe we could ""chip in""
varying amounts to Mom and Dad's trip so that cindy and richard could afford
it.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Subject: London Hotel

Right now, I am booked at 47 Park for next week.  I would love to be closer 
to the office, but I don't know if there is anything that makes sense.  Any 
suggestions?  If not something close to the office, would you suggest another 
spot besides 47 Park?  

I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the 
office tonight.  I will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time 
to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner, too.  --Sally

vacation that I took before Christmas.  It was fun to be home with the 
children, although I certainly worked hard -- up every night until very late 
either baking or wrapping gifts or writing notes on last minute Christmas 
cards.  

I plan to be in the London office next week.  I will leave Houston on Sunday 
evening and will arrive in London Monday morning.  After a stop by the hotel, 
I should be in the office after lunch.  I plan to be there through Thursday, 
and will fly back to Houston on Friday morning.  

I have a number of things planned to review with Mike Jordan.  Some of the 
major goals for the trip are:

 to review Mike Jordan's action plan to move the close and officialization of 
London books to same  day,

 to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts 
(we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 for managers and above within 
Operations for EA, EGM and EIM),

 to discuss the Doorstep process with Mike's business controllers in the 
London office who will participate in  Doorstep reviews this year, 

 to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London 
office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR

I also plan to visit with Mike on the feasibility of utilizing our 
operational pricing model in London and his thoughts on CommodityLogic and 
other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office 
services.  Mike also has some members of the London team that he would like 
for me to meet.  

Other things planned are spending some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy.  
Ted and I will have a conference call with Shona and Cassandra (and team) for 
a download on the New York metals Doorstep review that is taking place this 
week.  

I would welcome your participation in any or all of the above.  In addition, 
I hope that you may have some time for the two of us to touch base.  Also, if 
you have an opening for lunch or dinner, do let me know.  I have been in the 
throws of bonus allocations this week, but hope that today I can start to 
finalize my calendar for next week.  --Sally ",Non Abusive

large, with an exposure to 12 million shares (though it is a little hedged by

We also recalculated Merchant Asset VaR.

was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at 
that point.  Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:

 review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London 
books to same day,

 to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for 
London counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are 
doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) 

 discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your 
business controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep 
reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to 
continually improve the process), 

 discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office

 discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London 

 discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around 
potential commercialization of  mid and back office services

 
In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you 
think would be beneficial.  Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael 
Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.  I will also

and dinner on the evening of January 31 (if that is still the best night for

was going to cover this, and she thought that she could find some dollars in 
her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost. Either way, consider it 
done.  I am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend.  
However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not 
bring up the attachment.   Can you try that again and check with Patti to 
make sure she has it in readable form?  I will be in London all of next week, 
and I would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and 
dinner.  I will need their e:mail addresses to do so.  I don't know whether 
or not you included that on your list.  

Jody said that Ruggles for game watching was really cold!!  I wonder if that 
could be a problem on the 31st?  You never know with Houston weather.  What 
do you think?  We could do the tour and then go to Irma's Southwest Grill (2 
blocks from the stadium, same great food with a more sleek atmosphere - owned 
by Irma's son, Luis).  

I will be in touch with Patti while I am in London next week to make sure 
that plans are progressing on this.   We will include our recent OU grads as 
well.

Subject: Summer Internship


Lexi Elliot,

Hi, my name is Judd Eisenberg, and I am a business student at the
University of Texas who is seeking the summer analyst internship at excelr.
I received an opportunity to meet you at a reception dinner that excelr
hosted last semester in Austin.  I have always been intrigued with the
analyst and associate rotational programs that excelr offers.  The courses I
take in school, accounting and particularly finance, my extensive job
experience, and my leadership positions have provided me with valuable
skills for the summer analyst position.  I have a good friend at UT who
will start working full-time for excelr in the IT division in a few months,
and I know he is truly looking forward to the challenges and opportunities
that excelr provides.  Because I am currently interning with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Houston, I am not able to go through the
recruiting process at the university.  I am sending an attachment of my
resume in this e-mail since I am going to be in Houston until mid-March.
Please e-mail me if there are any openings for the position I am seeking or
if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Judd Eisenberg

Subject: Summer Internship


Lexi Elliot,

Hi, my name is Judd Eisenberg, and I am a business student at the
University of Texas who is seeking the summer analyst internship at excelr.
I received an opportunity to meet you at a reception dinner that excelr
hosted last semester in Austin.  I have always been intrigued with the
analyst and associate rotational programs that excelr offers.  The courses I
take in school, accounting and particularly finance, my extensive job
experience, and my leadership positions have provided me with valuable
skills for the summer analyst position.  I have a good friend at UT who
will start working full-time for excelr in the IT division in a few months,
and I know he is truly looking forward to the challenges and opportunities
that excelr provides.  Because I am currently interning with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Houston, I am not able to go through the
recruiting process at the university.  I am sending an attachment of my
resume in this e-mail since I am going to be in Houston until mid-March.
Please e-mail me if there are any openings for the position I am seeking or
if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Judd Eisenberg

Hi Patti,

This will probably be the first of many emails in the next couple of weeks.

Do you have a location as to where Beth will be sitting over there?  We'll be 
packing up her boxes soon to ship over and for future post etc.

Also, she will need a new extension number.  She would most definately prefer 
an 853 number and if you can use her VP status to help her get one if they 
refuse (her words) then that would be great.  Her old number was 853-5521 
although someone else may have that now.

Thank you for your help.  It is very much appreciated.

Greetings from Houston!

I have a special request for you.  In order for us to prepare our campus
recruiting strategy for next fall, I need information regarding
internship
recruiting.

As you know, we decided to concentrate our spring 2001 effort on intern
recruiting and interviewing.  In order for us to ensure that we are
being
effective with this strategy, I need to know which companies interviewed
for summer interns during the fall 2000 recruiting season.  Companies of
particular interest would be El Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Duke, consulting
firms such as McKinsey, and Big 5 accounting firms.

By providing this information, you would greatly assist our effort for
upcoming years.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Rick has asked that I help him ensure that we all finish up our merit 
increases in time for the new deadline of this Friday, January 19.

1.  Could you please ""submit"" by the end of the day tomorrow, Wednesday, 
January 17?  Then Rick and I can review and get back with you with any 
changes.  

2.  If you could leave me a voice mail or eMail when you are finished, I 
would appreciate it.  I am moving back to the excelr building and will get 
back my old number (X36641) effective tomorrow.

3.  In addition, we are interested in your thoughts on the merit process 
overall, both for yourself and for your groups.  In general, it seems like a 
lot of ""administration"" for some pretty small numbers.  What are your 
thoughts - do you like the current process or would less frequent, larger 
increases be preferable (assuming we could make that change in the larger 
overall excelr framework)?

Please call me or Andrea Yowman (x31477) with any questions.  Thanks for your 
help!

and most appropriate.  In addition,  it always warms my heart when I see a

All of the companies that you mentioned interview for internships during
Spring (February) recruiting.  Fall is primarily when these companies
come for full time recruiting.

Lynett and Cindy:

Greetings from Houston!

I have a special request for you.  In order for us to prepare our campus
recruiting strategy for next fall, I need information regarding
internship
recruiting.

As you know, we decided to concentrate our spring 2001 effort on intern
recruiting and interviewing.  In order for us to ensure that we are
being
effective with this strategy, I need to know which companies interviewed
for summer interns during the fall 2000 recruiting season.  Companies of
particular interest would be El Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Duke, consulting
firms such as McKinsey, and Big 5 accounting firms.

By providing this information, you would greatly assist our effort for
upcoming years.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Lexi Elliott

Sally,

Have you had a chance to look at UT presentation for Monday?  I will need to 
email final copy to Lexi by Monday morning (her flight is 2:00 PM) and she 
would like a cd for backup.  I can handle that.  She has supplied me with new 
dates for last page.  If you get a chance to review - just fax pages to me at 
713-345-8100.  If not, I can work on it monday morning.

Again, I am so happy for you.  It's such a BIG deal to be promoted to MD.  
Please share any thoughts you might have with me on how this affects my role 
as your assistant and what I can do to better assist you.  You know, this job 
that I have now with you is the job I have waited for all my life.  It is 
challenging, fast-paced, and has a lot of potential for growth.  You make me

and know that I am extremely lucky to have this job.

I will see you on Monday the 29th.  If anything comes up next week, I can be 
reached at my new temporary home (mother in-laws)  713 520 0766

Also  -- I believe Fernley has passed the Merit raise part of this year end 
comp review over to you, so I thought I would give you the facts.

Base salary $165,000
Foreign Adjustment  $30,000     these two items will go away on Jan 28th  --- 
and I am left with the base salary
Car Allowance           $12000

total regular pay     $207,000

also  -- they have had me on a 2 year contract  (not sure if they do that in 
Houston, but I am willing)  which had some annual cash kickers)


We can discuss when I get there, but in case you need it next week, just

I also would like to compliment you on putting together one of the best  2 
1/2  hour seminars / workshops that I have ever attended ( I know that is 
saying a mouthful).  The Operational Risk Meeting / Workshop was not only 
informative, but the constantly changing formats kept everyone's attention.   
I believe the meeting also caused a renewed enthusiasm among your supervisory

execution I'm afraid - this is our HR departments we are talking about!

Subject: Bonus Communication

Received your e:mail today about bonus letters not being ready until next 
week.  Timing is fine.  However, Brent Price (EGM operations) received bonus 
letters for his operations team this afternoon from his HR team.  Brent will 
be out of the country on business next week, so he will distribute those 
letters right away.  

This highlights the issues that I raised earlier this week when I found out 
that not all operations personnel had been transferred to ENW as of January 
1.  Not only do we have different HR teams with apparently different 
directives, but some of my team is still defined as an integral part of a 
business unit (EGM and EIM) and the bulk of my team is operating as service 
providers through ENW (dedicated of course to the success of excelr Americas, 
but somehow starting to feel a bit removed).  I think that Robert Jones is 
running down how I can get access to systems that give me information on 
operations employees who support EA, EGM and EIM.  While necessary, that is 
really not addressing my point.  My conversation with Greg Whalley on moving 
operations under Net Works was very explicit on making that an all or nothing 
proposition (i.e. we would move ENA, EIM and EGM operations employees under 
ENW).  I asked about London, but he deferred at the time on that one.  But 
there was not deferral on EIM and EGM.  This movement out of the business 
units is not an insignificant change.  

I still believe that this needs to be all or nothing.  We have now created 
two classes of operations staffs - one that is  part of trading/origination 
operating companies and one that is part of Net Works.  The company will 
benefit if we can freely move employees from operating company to operating 
company to capitalize on skills.  We have done this quite frequently in 
operations in the past, moving people from gas to crude products or gas to 
paper.  We have now made that hard, because we have operations personnel on 
three different payrolls - ENW, EGM and EIM.  This creates assumptions around 
value judgements as well.  EIM and EGM personnel are more integrally linked 
with their business units than those who support EA.  Over time, this won't 
be a good message.   The promotion memo that you plan to send out this week 
highlights this problem.  When I asked whether operations personnel under 
Brent Price would be included in the memo, the answer seems to be ""no"", 
because ""they are not ENW employees"".   And yet we ranked and made promotion 
decisions on Brent's staff jointly with ENA and EIM operations personnel.  (I 
had actually drafted a promotion memo from me that would cover all operations 
promotions regardless of business unit that they service, but I will not move 
forward with that given that your memo
 will address those promotions - or at least some of them)  This seems like a 
small issue but is just a great example of a myriad of complications that 
will arise .  

My question again is whether this situation is bad execution on someone's 
part, or is it reflective of a change in Greg Whalley's view on having all 
operations personnel under Net Works?  Have McConnell/Shankman and 
McMahon/Bowen lobbied to have their operations personnel remain as an 
integral part of their teams, reflected tangibly through remaining EGM and 
EIM employees?  If that is the case, I fear that this inconsistency won't 
serve the company well as the year progresses.  

We have time on the calendar on Friday, so we can discuss this further then.

those of you with hiring needs in non-commercial, accounting areas.  In 
preparation of campus interviews, and before extending any offers to join us 
for the summer, accounting hiring needs first have to be determined.  

As you know,  the summer is an important phase of our recruiting efforts, and 
a quality summer is essential.  In efforts to ensure a quality summer 
program, pre-determined placements, especially for the accounting interns are 
a must.  The purpose is two fold:  to effectively compete with the accounting 
firms, as well as, communicating the need of accountants in the various 
business units to our Career Development Department.  At this time, the 
Career Development Department has had no indication of any needs relative to 
non-commercial analyst support, summer or full-time.

Our window of time is extremely small for establishing hiring needs specific 
to accounting.  With that in mind and again, before any offers are extended, 
Career Development needs to be informed of your needs for summer accounting 
analysts.

Mike and Sally:

I have been in contact with Ted Jacobs and have volunteered $1500 in 
scholarship funds to be awarded by excelr this spring.  By volunteering this 
money, we are now able to attend scholarship interviews on Tuesday, March 6 
on campus.  This will provide us with the opportunity to target candidates 
for next fall and lay the groundwork for a more competitive future.

After we have identified our scholarship recipients, we are invited to 
present our awards at the Scholarship Awards Banquet on Friday, April 20.  

Ted will (if he has not already) approach you, Mike, to see if you are 
interested in playing a role at this event.   If you are available to attend, 
please let me know.  I plan to have at least 2 excelr representatives at the 
event.

I just wanted to give each of you these details to keep you fully informed of 
our efforts on campus.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please let 
me know.


Thank you,

Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over 
Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a 
brochure.  Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have 
only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two 
beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds.  
Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two rooms, 
one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would probably do 
that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five is almost too 
many in one room and bathroom.  

I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving sounds 
like a good plan.  Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and ask 
about the San Antonio/Sun City crowd?

Hello, Sista -

Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well) -
and here's the latest idea:

Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, how
about we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - during
THanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at that
time - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks maybe
we could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the Thanksgiving travel
MADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which may
help you.

Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom and
dad would like that.

Thoughts?   -Cara

At Monday's EGM meeting, Mike McConnell asked me to describe the WebModal 
acquisition EGM made last week.  Following is a brief description of the 
freight capacity market and what WebModal gets us:

Market

The US market for logistics is $600bn annually.  We are pursuing the largest 
homogenous segment which is long-haul truckload and intermodal.  That market 
is $50-$100bn annually, depending on who you ask and whether you include 
dedicated fleets.

The interesting thing about these markets is that they are extremely 
fragmented and massively intermediated.  There are over 100,000 trucking 
companies (carriers) in the US and thousands of independent brokers (brokers 
in this market act as credit principals).  10-20% of all loads are conducted 
in the spot market (brokered) and the rest are done under 1-3 year contracts 
that are generally non-firm, but define the relationship between each shipper 
and their chosen carriers or intermediaries.

On the rail side, the US railroads act as wholesalers, selling their capacity 
to Intermodal Marketing Companies (IMCs).  The IMCs then retail or broker out 
that capacity to shippers.  The difficult part of ground intermodal is that 
the rail haul makes up only the long-haul component.   The trip from the 
origin warehouse to the origin rail yard and then the delivery from the 
destination rail yard to the destination warehouse has to be done by truck.  
This first and last mile transportation is called ""drayage"".  

WebModal

WebModal developed a system to price and schedule intermodal moves so they 
look identical to truck.  They have a database with prices and schedules from 
all the RRs and 48 drayage companies that gives them complete US coverage.  A 
buyer can type in their scheduling and equipment requirements and receive 
instantaneous quotes for zipcode to zipcode service.

Because of the inherently different cost and performance structures of rail 
and truck, the pricing differences between the two modes of transportation is 
significant.  For any move greater than 500 miles, intermodal is generally 
20-30% less expensive than a single driver truck move.  The substitutability 
of intermodal and truckload should allow us to trade the spread in price.

The WebModal acquisition gets us a team with tremendous industry expertise 
and a good head start as we enter this market.  The next move will be to 
build a truck intermediation capability.  

I encourage you to meet Chris Kravas the CEO of WebModal.  He will be 
spending all of his time in Houston when he is not on the road.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Dan Reck

I think it would be great if you could attend on both dates.  However, the 
more important of the two would be March 6 as that would allow you to hear 
the students interview and assess their skills.

There is a slim chance that Mike could attend the event in April.  Jody Crook 
plans on attending that event, too.  I will be at both events, so there will 
be an excelr face at both events.

Please let me know if you will be available.

Thank you,

Mike and Sally:

I have been in contact with Ted Jacobs and have volunteered $1500 in 
scholarship funds to be awarded by excelr this spring.  By volunteering this 
money, we are now able to attend scholarship interviews on Tuesday, March 6 
on campus.  This will provide us with the opportunity to target candidates 
for next fall and lay the groundwork for a more competitive future.

After we have identified our scholarship recipients, we are invited to 
present our awards at the Scholarship Awards Banquet on Friday, April 20.  

Ted will (if he has not already) approach you, Mike, to see if you are 
interested in playing a role at this event.   If you are available to attend, 
please let me know.  I plan to have at least 2 excelr representatives at the 
event.

I just wanted to give each of you these details to keep you fully informed of 
our efforts on campus.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please let 
me know.


Thank you,

On January 12, I hosted a brainstorming session at the Four Seasons hotel i=

 a=20
plan for launching this strategic commercial venture, we are hosting an=20
integrated design session facilitated by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (CGEY) at=
=20
their Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas. =20

I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desig=
n=20
session.  This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13t=
h=20
in Dallas, Texas.   This work session is based on a unique approach called =
a=20
DesignShop=01v.  It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is compos=
ed of=20
various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups. If you=
=20
have not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely=20
regard this session as different from any working session you have previous=
ly=20
experienced. The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven=
=20
to be very successful.  Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20
methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.

A limited number of representatives from excelr will be attending.  You were=
=20
selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th=
e=20
DesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as=
=20
little distraction or interruption as possible.  The quality of our results=
=20
depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the=
=20
entire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor=
t=20
and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. =
=20
This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s=
o=20
that your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all=20
necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during=
=20
these two days.

Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,=
=20
and transportation.  Preliminary information as to schedule and environment=
=20
has also been included.  You may direct any additional questions concerning=
=20
the event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.

I hope that you will be able to participate.  Please confirm your attendanc=
e=20
for the two days with Marvia Jefferson at 713-853-9165 by January 29th 5:00=
=20
p.m.  If you are unable to attend, it may be appropriate to select someone=

else to participate.  Please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to=

Hi, sistas-

Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed ""17"" with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here's a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into
thirds

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to
consider other options.    Thoughts?   -cara

Subject: Congratulations

I asked Mike this week if your baby was here, and he said that you had just 
returned to the office.  Congratulations on the birth of your little girl.  I 
hope that all three of you are surviving those first few weeks of adjustment 
and that sleep is not too short a commodity in your house!   I will look 
forward to seeing pictures of Lauren when I am next in London.  You do know 
that now that you are a dad that it is a requirement to be armed with 
adorable pictures at all times?!

office will be providing the training.

We will divide the training into three sessions on February 22nd  as follows:

10:00 - 12:00 Origination team training
1:30 - 2:30 Energy Operations team training 
3:00 - 5:00 Trading team training 

All training will be in the Video #2 boardroom (next to Liz Prior).  Please

Thought you might want to see what we are preparing for the DealBench team.  
This was our first third party auction.  Although we had some major technical 
issues (the site went down for over an hour between auctions), Sabre saved 
over $500,000 which hopefully made up for the down time.  My team did an 
excellent job calling the auction participants and reacting very quickly as 
the site was brought back up.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Recycling Summary Integration plan

Please find attached the summary integration plan that you requested during 
our debriefing last week. 

The first part of the table shows the controls objectives and the controls in 
place at 31 Dec 2000 when excelr Metal Recycling was divided into two halves: 
MGMR and Bergman.  Our overall controls assessment per risk at that stage was 
level 2 (below average controls).  

We have sumarised the implementation steps required to achieve an increase in 
controls assessment to level 3 (average), 4 (good)  or 5 (excellent) in each 
case,  along with latest completion dates to achieve those controls. 

We have then added a column of comments on the actual implementation with a 
bar chart to show how far advanced the work is.  The revised controls 
assessment at 31 Jan shows an average of 2.5 and our plan should enable the 
controls to be around a level 3 (average) by end of February. 

We will issue a revised table monthly in order to clearly update you on our 
progress.  If you would like to schedule a specific meeting to go through any 
of the points or queries that you may have, please let me know and I will 
organise.

Many thanks

premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.

after the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much 
easier for me if the meeting is at my house.  

Sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it 
from a woman's point of view would be interesting!  

I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another 
thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to 
an Astro's game.  I have season tickets through excelr and can buy blocks of 
tickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to 
see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could 
discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  

I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large 
number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied 
up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls 
who take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  

Thanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little 
travelling at the end of the year.  Report from the Calgary office today is 
that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime 
tempurature reading!).

I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.  I will leave with 
David the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that 
is needed while I am out of town.  --Sally

Sally:? I am refiguring this meeting...I have tried three  places and can not 
find a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance,  so I checked 
notes...you were correct, Pam Martins dad and Emily U. dad were  both 
volunteered by their wives, I will check them out this evening.? I  have call 
into Bob Lindsay, policeman and NCL dad, about safety.. we will  see.? I 
thought I might try to get some brief info from Ann YOung on  Applause 
Theatre, our new phil.? On nominations, there were a couple of  girls who did 
not complete info sheets last time, I will call them  tonight.? Also, I can 
check with the three on nominations and see when they  are available, will 
let you know.? If you don't mind having regular  ticktocker meeting at your 
house, that would be great.? If all else fails,  Sarah Marshall (yes, that is 
right) probably knows more about car care than  anyone I know...the girls 
call her if their car doesn't start.? Her theory  is that the first thing is 
to turn down the_______ radio as you are backing out  the drive, so you can 
hear your car...pretty basic.?
Summary:? Can we do TT meeting at your house?? I  will email agenda for that 
meeting to you.? I will have Abi check with  girls about nominations and let 
you know when they can meet...we will go from  there.? Is this okay with 
you.? This is the meeting I thought we might  dd Dad/ dtr but too close, so 
we better come up with another idea....dance  lesson, maybe...think Megan 
suggested that.? 
?
Have a good trip. Linda

to Connecticut soon to join her husband.  He has been working up there for 
the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our 
weather derivatives team about a year ago.  She hopes to continue to work for 
excelr - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I 
can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in excelr's New York 
office.  

It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn 
could be someone for you to consider.   She came originally from the London 
office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some 
feedback on her.  In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very 
early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.  She came to 
Houston and  has done a number of different things.  I think that she is well 
organized and control minded.  Understands excelr's business.  Managing a 
group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.  I am not sure that 
people enjoy working under her.  That could be old news, however.  There are 
a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her 
based on very recent experience.  Do you know of her?  

Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.  
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.  She would 
definitely represent an excelr point of view.  They have two small daughters - 
she might be interested in something part time even.  Could mean lower cost 
that way.  

This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.  
If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you 
could go to for some fact finding around her.  Let me know.  --Sally   ",Non Abusive

mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale 
businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around 
mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test 
- i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of 
transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.  
Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of 
explaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does 
happen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we 
believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where 
operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. 

These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which 
excelr has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely 
designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to 
produce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and 
potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that 
are valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage 
success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class 
practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep 
review process would follow this set of steps:

 1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This 
is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be 
notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain 
that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town. 

 2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell 
them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in 
making information and personnel available to complete the review.  

 3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key 
commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and 
key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The 
deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process 
and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  

 4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of 
the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those 
which may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested.  
This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually 
very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support 
their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an 
additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with 
this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support 
the growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office 
know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing 
so. 

 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be 
reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls 
and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, 
assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate 
personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume 
responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and 
to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.  
Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey 
to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, 
doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep 
findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep 
teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each 
doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me 
sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick 
before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular 
concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more 
timely manner than quarterly.   

Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in 
Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors 
in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not 
concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the 
integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were 
discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with excelr's 
practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley 
was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted 
Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was 
for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  

Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from 
Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the 
case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I 
know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you 
would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when 
they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as 
a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in 
this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert 
them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the 
level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing 
directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and 
myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the 
download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice 
mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a 
meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me.  
In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona 
mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked 
for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the 
integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control 
which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  

To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the 
heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is 
to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to 
offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire 
excelr organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The 
findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, 
which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to 
""over-wordsmith"" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be 
surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can 
reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical 
perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  

I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with 
you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as 
valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain 
members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other 
businesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any 
suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process.",Non Abusive
30449,beck-s/discussion_threads/3874.,<3920234.1075856036641.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Thanks for your note Sally that is very helpful .
I think my main concern is to ensure that we have the most effective and 
efficient communication between the Doorstep team and the business unit . I 
would like John and I to be more involved in the process so that the team can 
put the situation in context , so that they know our concerns in addition to 
any they may have . It is also important to be clear as to what has already 
been identified and is being addressed and how . While I understand that part 
of the idea of doorstep is to "" rattle the cages "" of the commercial 
management , it is important to check if my cage is already rattling as it 
was in this case . 
John and I would always expect to see and discuss a report before it is 
discussed in Houston - unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise . I 
take any issues of a control nature very seriously but my approach is to 
insist on a verification of the facts before making any judgements which does 
lead to some delay , on occasion , while facts are being gathered . What I 
would also like , in addition to a briefing and discussion at the start of 
the review , is a debrief from the team to get their impressions directly , 
both as to the issues and also as to how my control teams are doing . There 
is always a question of prioritisation of resource , particularly in 
businesses like metals which will be a constant challenge ( going forward you 
will have similar issues on Steel etc ) and I would like the doorstep team to 
provide me with their input on whether they agree with our approach and also 
to discuss areas where I think an additional doorstep review may be helpful 
.  I know you are working on the doorstep process with Mike Jordan , but I 
would be grateful if you could ensure that the increased communication 
happens in the future .

 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be 
reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls 
and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, 
assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate 
personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume 
responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and 
to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.  
Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey 
to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, 
doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep 
findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep 
teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each 
doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me 
sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick 
before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular 
concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more 
timely manner than quarterly.   

Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in 
Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors 
in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not 
concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the 
integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were 
discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with excelr's 
practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley 
was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted 
Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was 
for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  

Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from 
Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the 
case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I 
know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you 
would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when 
they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as 
a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in 
this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert 
them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the 
level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing 
directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and 
myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the 
download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice 
mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a 
meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me.  
In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona 
mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked 
for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the 
integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control 
which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  

To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the 
heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is 
to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to 
offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire 
excelr organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The 
findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, 
which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to 
""over-wordsmith"" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be 
surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can 
reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical 
perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  

I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with 
you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as 
valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain 
members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other 
businesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any 
suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process.

Hi, sistas-

Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed ""17"" with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here's a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into
thirds

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to
consider other options.    Thoughts?   -cara

1. The UT Alumni at excelr would pledge $1 million over four years to the=20

 a=20
matching $500,000 from excelr.

2. The matching program provided through the McCombs gift to the Business=

3. The result would be a permanently endowed $2 million =01&excelr Chair=018=

Report, President=01,s Associates, etc.  In other words, a $10,000 contribu=
tion=20
matched by excelr will be considered as a $20,000 contribution by that=20
individual for recognition purposes.

2. excelr has agreed to not count it=01,s match against an employee=01,s ann=

way that makes it a part of the =01&excelr Chair=018.

3. The gift may also be counted toward any previous pledge made to the =01&=

Subject: Wholesale Deal Meetings

The following is from Mike Patrick:

Wes Colwell's Hot List Meetings have previously been held on Thursdays at 
1:30pm and attended by various parties.  This meeting has been replaced by 
the Wholesale Deal Meeting to be held at the same time and location.  The 
attendees will be comprised of each Wholesale Business Unit's CAO, 
Transaction Support lead, Tax lead and Energy Operations management.  The 
meeting will be held bi-weekly and will be adjusted as necessary.   Please 
note that the first meeting will be held tomorrow, Thursday February 22 at 
1:30pm in EB3321.

The purpose of this meeting is :

1) For the CAO/Transaction support lead to summarize the Top 3 deals for the 
quarter in each business unit, focusing on any potential issues that might 
derail the closing of the deal, and

2) For the Transaction Support team to update the group on any global 
accounting issues, and

3) To create/maintain a ""Wholesale Critical Deal Sheet"" comprised of 
Wholesale's Top Ten critical deals

The meeting is not intended to be a business unit administration meeting 
(i.e., floor space, SAP, etc.).  I believe Wes still plans to hold a 
Wholesale CAO meeting to discuss other non-deal issues.

Following are the dates of the upcoming meetings.  The meetings will be held 
from 1:30pm - 2:30pm in EB3321.

to excelr on how they would help add value or help excelr execute mid/back 
office and/or CommodityLogic in a commercial manner.  I don't want this 
meeting related at all to Andy's efforts with Accenture related to 
transaction feeds unless Andy thinks it is OK.

I have told Baldwin at Accenture that Mid/back office and CommodityLogic is 
separate from what he is working on with Dave Samuals and Andy on Transaction 
hubs and is separate from DealBench, etc.  If we are not careful, Accenture 
will be working with four or five different points of contact at Net Works 
and we will end up hurting ourselves.

I am counting on Salley, Rex, Andy and Tom ASAP to each understand what the 
other is doing with Accenture and make sure there is no way Accenture can 
work us to our disadvantage. I also think Accenture needs to earn our 
business because others can do what they are offering.

Also, check with Rex Shelby on PWC.  We just had an uncomfortable experience 
with PWC that everyone should understand.  I recommended an Accenture meeting 
but if Tom wants PWC, he should understand what they did to Rex.

Remember, all of this is very confidential so let's be very careful 
internally and no meetings without transaction specific NDAs.

Your thoughts?

I am out next week but will check voice mail daily at 36635.

Good luck.

Subject: CommodityHub Meetings with PwC and Accenture

In a meeting today with Greg, it became clear that all of us running Net 
Works platforms are heading down the path of creating some form of a ""neutral 
hub"" for the industry to use to exchange data.

At Greg's suggestion, I am trying to arrange meetings with PwC (Pat Guzman, 
Phil Greedy) and Accenture (Kenny Baldwin) on February 26 and/or 27 to see if 
either of them represent good candidates to administer the hub. The meetings 
will be held in the excelr building and should run about an hour.

My assistant will be contacting you/your assistants to coordinate these two 
meetings.

All the best,

Tom

reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied 
possible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the best 
decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of 
core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value 
proposition.

As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.  
To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will 
lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end 
users.   

Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week.  
Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate

reported to Mary Solmonson within my organization.  The group was led by a 
director, and consisted of 2 managers, 1 senior specialist and 4 
specialists.  The employees were made aware of this decision last Friday 
afternoon.  My HR rep was on hand to explain the help that all will receive 
in finding new assignments within excelr through the excelr Corp. Re-deployment 
Team.  Mary Solmonson continues as one of my direct reports, focused on 
CommodityLogic and our business development efforts regarding the 
commercialization of mid and back office services.  

As part of my on-going effort to deliver both the best value and quality of 
service within Energy Operations, I reviewed core versus non-core activities 
within my team.  I am committed to investing appropriately in people 
resources to support core activities.  And I believe that we can become even 
more effective if investments in non-core activities are eliminated.    The 
role played by the Strategic Intiatives team in coordinating systems projects 
will be more appropriately shouldered by the IT project leads and the 
respective business sponsors/end users.  The ""middle-man"" role played by the 
Strategic Initiatives team had ceased to deliver appropriate value.

Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified

I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a 
short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on 
potential acquisitions.  We have identified our target teams for due 
diligence efforts around commodities.  While each person on the list has 
other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted 
to projects as they arise.  I will review this list continually and update it 
as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent 
job as part of a due diligence team.  I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had 
created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG 
acquisition.  We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this 
checklist so that all are prepared.  Let me know if you are interested in the 
names on my list.  Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence 
effort.  

Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business

I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the 
executive summary from the consulting team.  I followed up with Brent Price 
(my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an 
appropriate infrastructure to support that business.  Currently, Todd Hall 
and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.  Todd has 
other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time 
that Todd would have.  Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the 
lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.  She will be returning to 
Houston from the London office by the end of March.  She will be able to 
split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.  Todd will stay 
involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.  We will also 
keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.  Shelley is expected 
to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week 
regarding our plans.  I will keep you posted. ",Non Abusive

fruitful trip for the team.  
Schools are categorized by size - small, medium, large and super.  Klein is 
super-sized.  The Bearkadettes won first place and the grand champion trophy 
in the super category.  Best in Category awards are given for each category 
of team dance entered, regardless of school size.  Klein won best in category 
for all four team dances entered - kick, pom, military and jazz - a clean 
sweep.  Klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first 
place in the duet category.  Also won first place in officer dances for super 
sized schools.  They also won two special judges awards - not given out every 
time, but only when the judges want to especially recognize achievements.  
They got a special judges award for Creativity and Originality (commentary on 
both our fabulous costumes made by a group of Bearkadette moms and the 
choreography) and a special judges award for Perfect Score (a score of 100 
awarded by all 3 judges for a particular routine - apparently very rare).  
The Perfect Score award was for their pom routine, where they are dressed 
like penguins (one of the ones that Meagan was in).  The girls were pretty 
excited and the moms were cheering a lot, too.  They all work so hard and 
spend so many hours practicing that it is nice to see that pay off!!

providing Market Risk with a excelr Consolidated Preliminary DPR prior to 8

I'm sure you're working toward obtaining a final DPR earlier in the day, but 
meanwhile, we'd like to obtain a preliminary DPR that Global Ops can 
consolidate for Houston management's use first thing in the morning, as

from Houston, and I expect with the 6 hour time difference, your preliminary 
#s will be much firmer than ours.  We can start with just P/L and VaR, so 
it's not that many #s we need.  I'm hoping when we get the RisktRAC feeds 
complete we'll be able to see positions earlier as well.

about the prospect.  We expect him to be proactive and help out quite a bit 
with setting up the new Mexico trading legal entity.   I have no doubt that 
this will fix most of the little issues that we discussed.  

We also assigned someone to come to Monterrey to set up Jaime and Agustin 
with system access where appropriate, and especially access to Livelink, our 
automated contract viewing system.  This should facilitate access to all 
Mexico contracts online (originals kept in Houston), and there should be no 
need to keep hard copies in Mexico.

Please let me know if you see any other areas where Energy Ops can help, or 
should be more involved.

There has been a fair amount of discussion about this as well as the 
reporting of drift for the North America businesses.  Both Mike McConnell and 
Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.  I know 
that North America included US drift in its plan and includes ""drift 
earnings"" in its margin.  I believe you do the same in Europe.  Jeff is 
adamant that we not  move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has 
asked for UK drift to remain, as well.  You may want to call Jeff.  Sally and 
I will do what ever you guys decide.

 - Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives 
and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item);

Dear Sally,

This person comes as very highly recommended (my husband says she is one of 
the best people he has ever worked with).  Do you have any suggestions on who 
could use her business development skills?

a quick note to bring you up to date on some things. 

Commercialization Efforts- Services:  Delayed by several days due to the 
unexpected absence of Mary Solmonson for health reasons.  I learned about 
this when I returned to the office on Tuesday, and have worked to replace her 
as best we can during this market sizing phase.  Jennifer Denney (who was in 
Dallas with us and works under Sheri Thomas in the EOL Product Control Group) 
will partner with James Scribner in Mary's absence to help us run down 
additional data on potential customers.  Beth Apollo will be working closely 
with James and Jennifer.  They will welcome Rahil's help and will continue to 
work with Jennifer on developing the revenue model.  

Commercialization Efforts - Consulting:  Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made 
a presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for 
providing risk consulting services to external customers.  Some of his ideas 
overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas 
meeting.  Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk 
operations team.  I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort.  
Bjorn's vision is to create an excelr sub that will be the consulting 
company.  Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an 
accounting/consulting firm - established marketing arm, existing customer 
contacts, proven consulting skills, depth of resources, etc.  There could be 
a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us 
- we impart our risk knowledge, they get the edge in the marketplace from 
pairing with us, we take our upfront payment, they do most of the grinding 
work - not necessarily a bad model.  Bjorn seems to be in a hurry, as he has 
identified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting 
and is ready to pay.  Probably okay for him to start this effort in that 
way.  Prove concept, and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with 
someone else.  I spent some time with him today.  I want to be sure that he 
doesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and 
being in agreement with the fee structure.  We are okay for right now.  I 
will be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together 
if there is a good upside.  I will keep you posted.  

Commercialization Efforts - Internal Marketing:  We have to change some 
business practices within excelr and create a mind shift when originators are 
selling operational services to their customers.  We must price those and we 
must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations.  
Deal is in the works through power origination team - they priced our 
services to customer without our involvement- pricing may not even be 
sufficient to cover our costs.  We are researching.  To do's here are to 
create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to 
change DASH process so that Operations has a sign-off.  I met with Louise 
today on this.  I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week 
of March 19.  Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig 
teams.  I will get you a draft for your comments. 

Operational Risk:  Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in 
Portland.  Have worked with Stacey White (my power risk director) and Tim 
Belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work.  
I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan.  (We lost the manager of 
that group last week - a planned move to London to follow her husband to an 
excelr job there.  Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday 
of another risk book administrator from Portland.) 

Operational Risk:  Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale.  
End of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP.  We are 
working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues 
with customers after the sale effective date.  We expect to eliminate 46 
positions with the sale.  This number was much larger earlier in the year 
(around 70), but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale.  Bob 
Hall is focused on the details around this issue.  

Operational Risk:  We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office 
last week.  (This is the review of operational controls and procedures.)  
Went well - Max was skeptical about the process at first, but pleased in the 
end.  I will forward and e:mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of 
these reviews.  We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the 
remainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey.  He likes the 
revisions that we have made.  Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort.  

Spring Break Plans:  My children are on Spring Break the week of March 12 and 
the nanny has the week off.  We will be out of town through Wednesday, March 
13 with the whole family looking at colleges for Meagan.  Patti has contact 
numbers for me if needed.  I may decide to come back into the office on 
Thursday and Friday.  I will let Patti know when we get back in town.  I will 
either see you the end of next week, or back on Monday, March 19.  See 
separate e:mail for contact names and numbers in Operations while I am out.

Subject: VMS Project Next Steps

All,

It has been a very successful year for the excelr / Razorfish VMS project 
Team.  We have been developing a Direct Access Power Market, user managed, 
tariff based calculation engine and customer expense / revenue allocation 
application.

The efforts which have taken place to date will benefit each of us as we move 
forward into these deregulated Direct Access markets.  The current 
application has gone through the following evolution:

Project Definition & Design documentation
Database Design / Development
User Interface Design / Development
Communication layer (COM) Design / Development
Hardware requisition / Implementation (Development / Test / Production)
Arthur Anderson Audit (Passed Audit review - Application meets all minimum 
requirements)
The Major Functionality / Action Items which have been delivered to date:
Security Management (Only IT Resources to have access)
Event / Task Management & Reporting
Component / Equations Management & Reporting
Estimation Generation Management & Reporting
Counter Party Profile Management & Reporting
Settlement Entity Profile Management & Reporting
Deal-Upload Management & Reporting
Integrated Dispute Management & Reporting
Customer Generation Charge Profile & Reporting
Historical Data Conversion mechanism
95 % of Calculation Engine Original Functional Requirements

The Major Functionality which is under it's final steps of Development and 
User Test
Reconciliation (Exception Identification, Allocation & Reporting)
Settlement Entity - Settlement Statement / Invoice Parsing & Reporting
Remaining 5% of Calculation Engine Functionality

Over the past 12+ months a total of $3 MM dollars has been spend on VMS.  We 
are reaching the final phase of this project and I am not sensing that 
everyone is still on board with this being OUR (excelr) Volume Management 
strategic solutions for Direct Access Power Markets.

As of March 1, 2001 we no longer have a contract in place with Razorfish.  
Razorfish has provided six developers dedicated to assist the excelr Networks 
IT staff in delivering the VMS solution over the past year.  These resources 
have been key in helping us get to where we are today.  In addition we had 
originally planned to retain these resources over the remainder of 2001 
(03/2001 - 12/2001) to assist with the implementation of VMS on the West & 
East Desk and in the Toronto Canada office.  Without a contract in place and 
currently working on good faith.  The project has come to a serious point of 
action.  Razorfish is asking for a total of $728,000 for services rendered 
between 3/1/2001 and 6/30/2001.  They will keep the resources dedicated to 
the project and will deliver the following:
Finalise base product development, assist in unit / user testing and 
Implement base VMS Product in Production.
Application Production Support for 30 Days post Implementation
Transition of knowledge base from Razorfish resources to excelr Networks IT 
resources

Razorfish is willing to discuss terms to assist excelr throughout the 
remainder of the year.  However,  I don't feel that everyone is ready to make 
that decision.  We do however need to make a final decision on this first 
implementation.

As I have stated prior in this document,  ""We have accomplished a lot over 
the past year.""  Without the continued assistance from the Razorfish portion 
of the VMS team.  I don't see any of us meeting our 2001 Volume Management 
(VM) Direct Access Power Market objectives in a more efficient or economical 
fashion.  In some cases I don't see it being possible at all.

It is time to make a decision.  Do we all agree that we need to move forward 
and retain Razorfish services for the additional $728,000 and incur each of 
OUR allocation of the over all VMS capitalised project total cost or do we 
stop where we are and find other solution to address our needs and debate 
over who was in agreement in the beginning of the project in order to 
determine who picks up the $3 MM already spent.

Please provide me with your response by 5:00 PM PT to allow me to get back to 
Razorfish with a well deserved response by Friday.

Thanks - MO

will still be in the building/Houston however, because we are all working our 
tails off up here - plenty of infrastructure work in progress.

On that - just a couple of other things to mention.

1. Kim/Leslie decided to keep Ellen W - with a revised/upgraded role - which 
is good for Ellen. I think Ellen's disappointment was that they told her she 
was 'good to go' on the Tuesday - and changed their minds on Wednesday - 
invoking the '12 months' rule. However - Ellen seems over it - and is pleased 
with her new role. Point to note - it took an external 'inquiry' to make them 
realise what a potential diamond they had - maybe they may of seen it earlier 
- just an observation.

2. I'm still a couple of good quality deal capture/documentation people

30525,beck-s/discussion_threads/4068.,<14342285.1075856041980.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of 
people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that 
team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that 
perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic 
has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team 
and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy 
Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through 
CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the 
facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in 
conversations around CommodityLogic. 

Staffing Contributions
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior 
Director
 CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist

 User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power 
Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements 

Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic

 NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)
 ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) 


Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, 
were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked 
in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  
Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles 
where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing 
both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the 
operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the 
past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project 
managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations 
experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most 
appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie 
on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very 
quickly.  

One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a 
scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over 
natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since 
Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was 
already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the 
project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to 
EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, 
who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom 
looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently 
renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange 
project team, and we transfered her along with the project to 
CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements 
work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is 
input from my group that has created the modules by defining user 
requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  
I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's 
participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a 
senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development 
background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was 
the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on 
CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her 
involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to 
CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is 
excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable 
operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie 
Reeves, who played a significant role in building excelr's power business from 
day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging 
products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and 
both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and 
back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their 
replacements on CommodityLogic.

Happy to help with Kristin's week of Doorstep work with EES. I'm glad she 
will still be in the building/Houston however, because we are all working our 
tails off up here - plenty of infrastructure work in progress.

On that - just a couple of other things to mention.

1. Kim/Leslie decided to keep Ellen W - with a revised/upgraded role - which 
is good for Ellen. I think Ellen's disappointment was that they told her she 
was 'good to go' on the Tuesday - and changed their minds on Wednesday - 
invoking the '12 months' rule. However - Ellen seems over it - and is pleased 
with her new role. Point to note - it took an external 'inquiry' to make them 
realise what a potential diamond they had - maybe they may of seen it earlier 
- just an observation.

2. I'm still a couple of good quality deal capture/documentation people 
short. I would gladly take any quality candidates you may like to suggest.

3. EnFiber - our valuation/risk management engine (a cannabilised version of 
EnPower) is up and running - and live.

Hope you are well.

Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term ""protocol""

anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply 
e:mails or memos between excelr and AEP with regard to any sharing of 
information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  
Operational details to be decided between excelr and AEP have been handled 
exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (excelr) 
to Steve Jackson (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally 
documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the 
original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for 
gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with excelr's treasury 
group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband 
in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an

that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in excelr's

amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition 
issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of 
you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have 
to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require 
actions by excelr will be our ""to do"" list.  Each item has a due date and we 
will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list

 1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so 
that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and

 2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a

Thanks for our meeting last week.  Please let me know if you don't think 
we've sufficiently defined the deliverable for Business Ops.  Based on 
feedback from Louise - you and I still may not be clearly communicating yet 
as to what is required.

Specifically, AEP and excelr need to agree in writing for each Business Ops 
""process"" or function:

1. Who is going to carry out the Business Ops processes before and after 
close.
2. How control over the process will be handed over from excelr to AEP.
3. The necessary IT actions required to put the required system functionality 
in place (and who is responsible for implementing this). 

The table you developed at the end of last week (based on Bob's email) moves 
closer to this point.   As we discussed on the phone, we need to provide a 
description of the deliverables for each of the ""systems/activities"" you 
listed on the table and ensure that AEP understands (and signs off on) what 
they are responsible for.  To Anne's point, this ""sign off"" can be through a 
memo, protocol, acknowledged email, or other.  

We have been having a problem in that one part of AEP does not talk to the 
other part.  So, I would like to encapsulate and elevate the individual Bob 
Hall/Steve Jackson discussions so that all relevant levels of AEP (and excelr) 
understand what is being agreed before we close.

Each Tuesday at 4:00 we have a standing HPL Transition Coordination meeting 
to discuss the status of the deliverables from each group.   You are welcome 
to attend this meeting or the separate meeting we have now established each 
Wednesday with Bob H. and Tommy Y. to concentrate on HPL/IT/Business Ops 
matters.

Sally,  thanks for you personal attention to this.    

The quicker we close the quicker Bob can focus more of his time on Network's 
origination efforts.

Regards,
Brian

Sally, Bob - FYI 

I was able to get 5 telephone numbers set up on a temporary switch so if our 
counterparties call into the excelr building during the outage (Friday 10:00 
PM until Saturday 6 AM) they will get the voicemail of the 5 key schedulers 
that we selected. The voicemail gives the caller contact info. (page & home 
#'s). In addition if they hit zero it will be forwarded to our off-hours 
dispatching service. The dispatching service has current contact information 
for every pipe we do business on.  The schedulers were also instructed to 
call out to their key counterparties and make sure they have page, home and 
cell #'s.

If I had my way all of our schedulers telephone numbers would have been put 
on this temporary switch but five was the best we could do. Considering the 
time period I think we have minimal exposure however you never know when a 
pipeline of market emergency could occur. 

Let me know if you have any questions, tks - Bob

FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations

Last fall, the excelr Wholesale Services organization was created and 
announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.  All wholesale 
companies (excelr Americas, excelr Europe, excelr Global Markets and excelr 
Industrial Markets) plus excelr Net Works and excelr Global Assets were 
included in the excelr Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational 
memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was 
moved into excelr Net Works to align our operational services, information 
technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality 
services to excelr wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to 
evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as 
well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations 
teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.

Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we 
wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under excelr Net Works.  Senior 
management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to 
excelr Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks 
did not get fully executed.  

To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and 
non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately 
report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred 
to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting 
April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping 
purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' 
structure.

There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to excelr Net 
Works. Because you are transferring between excelr payroll companies, IRS 
requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only 
to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 
for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does 
not start over but continues as usual.

The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you 
on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden 
of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by 
filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the 
withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your 
tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.  
You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with 
any questions.  

We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you 
and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best 
practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, 
please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as 
identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is

John,

There has been a fair amount of discussion about this as well as the 
reporting of drift for the North America businesses.  Both Mike McConnell and 
Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.  I know 
that North America included US drift in its plan and includes ""drift 
earnings"" in its margin.  I believe you do the same in Europe.  Jeff is 
adamant that we not  move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has 
asked for UK drift to remain, as well.  You may want to call Jeff.  Sally and 
I will do what ever you guys decide.

I prepare the London Summary and I have been requested by John Sherriff here 
in London to have changes made to the reporting format of the Executive 
Viewer report.  John's request and the changes he has asked for are detailed 
below.  In essence, John would like excelr Europe's 'UK Drift' revenue to be 
reported under the 'excelr Europe' heading in the Exec Viewer instead of being 
reported under the 'Global Markets' heading.  If you agree to this change 
could you advise Chris Abel and Johnny Thibodeux to make the appropriate 
changes.  If, however,  you would like to discuss the matter further please 
contact John Sherriff.  

Regards

The attached is the format I believe we discussed and agreed with Ted a few 
days ago. In order that the guys in Houston will make the changes they 
require your authorisation.

If you can authorise by return then Michael Kass and I will forward it on to

changed.

Changes are required to the reporting format of excelr Europe's P/L in the 
Executive Viewer .  Below is a list of these changes as well as the person 
responsible for effecting each change:

Gary Hickerson: The UK Drift book is to be reclassified from the 'excelr 
Global Markets' heading to the 'excelr Europe' heading; 

Susie Ayala: The excelr Europe (Net Fair Value) Equity Investments book is to 
reclassified from 'Merchant Summary' to the 'excelr Europe' heading;

Chris Abel: The following changes are to be made to the books reported under 
the 'excelr Europe' heading:
 - J Block is to be reported as a separate line item;
 - Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives 
and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item); 
 - For each of the Electricty books, could you change the word Electricity to 
Power in the headings (for consistency purposes).

Subject: Global Standard on Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval

Sally / Beth,

As we discussed when I was in Houston I have put together a draft on 
Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval. I had a meeting arranged 
for today to go through my proposal with Ted Murphy and Tani Nath (she heads 
up research and structuring here in London) but Ted cancelled at the last 
minute (again). Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement, but before we 
can go any further we need Ted's input. He is now away for 2 1/2 weeks so 
there is going to be no further progress on this front.

In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put 
together. I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this 
stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC 
perspective. Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I 
am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at 
least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding. Others will 
also need to be consulted (and I would like to agree a list of key people 
with you) but I can't see their being any real contention. Can you ?

I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston 
(and it may well be here too) and this has been added to the outstanding 
list. I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be 
completed as part of the curve validation 

If there are any questions or feedback please let me know.

James

Subject: Merchanting Metals Update #2

The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( 
see attached email ) was to provide  
a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage, spread and brand 
and location
a timely substantiation of 
stock on balance sheet
forward MTM 
debtors and creditor balances
OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany 
account

Despite the best efforts of IT, continuing problems with the AS400 
application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock 
reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright 
stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering 
sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - 
which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and 
forward positions to full accounting values.

Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the 
following :

I will discuss with AA the following
that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to 
data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model 
simplifications)
that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, 
AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these 
differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA 
within the audit timetable)
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my 
earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards 
) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to 
meet the above stated objectives
The signoff for additional permanent 'excelr' headcount who will 'duplicate' 
certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing 
Traffic staff
A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the 
final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400. We will continue to 
investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or 
system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe. However, 
this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and 
signoff of system p&l values with traders.
The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( 
reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and 
repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.

Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full 
reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination
an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing 
planned 23 rd review due to system issues ), requiring
full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 th
sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to 
Barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually 
created position analysis
the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our 
cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 
23 rd

I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

Regards

Mike

Subject: Merchanting Metals update

Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating 
risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility 
(""OBSF"") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility 
late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, 
arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the 
operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result 
of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on 
gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting 
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain 
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as 
to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and 
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage 
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting 
developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as 
to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process 
tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all 
Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 
covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand 
and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within 
the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical 
VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been 
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of 
Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements 
for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control 
staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit 
timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source 
documentation within excelr
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party 
inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will 
not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward 
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report 
signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( 
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) 
and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where 
applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or 
external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during 
April 

If you have any questions please call me on x34703

Mike

Subject: Forecast for 2001

Sally,
One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the 
rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT 
for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy 
since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so 
there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, 
however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for 
an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to 
be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to 
put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know 
in a few days I would appreciate it.

their comments.  Rahil is free from the day-to-day operations issues and has

We can still set up an offsite to finalize, but we need to get something out 
because these individuals are already out selling as we speak.

But I assume the invitation will be extended to all of their groups so that 
whoever they want can attend. 

I would actually prefer that the presentation is actually circulated to the 
groups on Friday rather than presented as we will wait forever on getting an 
offsite together.  How about circulating the presentation and then letting 
them refer all questions to Rahil - see how much interest you get.  One on 
ones are much better and I think this is how Rahil should proceed.  We need 
to get in front of customers in the next couple of weeks.

Let's aim to get a least three customers this quarter.

the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue

Calgary  Ladain

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy

marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the 
opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with 
Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work

would like.  --Sally

I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our

people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.  Floor 
meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and 
yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with 
our reorganization late last fall.  I will diligently work with Philippe and 
Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net 
Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key 
excelr businesses that we support.  I suspect that motivating and managing in 
this environment will become increasingly challenging.  This is an FYI more 
than anything else.  --Sally

used a process that gives you tickets for games in proportion to the number

well done.  

We have improved our tickets this year.  Thanks to Patti, who scoped out 
options for new tickets, and to my husband, who studied advantages and 
disadvantages of each option, we  have some good seats for the year.  The new 
tickets (4 together) are Dugout tickets, located between home and third base,

the seats for the pre-season opener, and they are a big improvement over last

I chose not to circulate a copy last Friday - reality was that I didn't think 
that any of the originators would read it over the weekend anyway.  We had 
hoped to have a final draft ready on Monday (April 9), with plans to review 
that with Andy Zipper for his input and then two ""test runs"" with Ed Baughman 
and Frank Vickers on Tuesday.  With any suggested changes from those test 
runs, my plan was to circulate copies to you and John Lavorato on Tuesday as 
well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams.  
We scraped the idea of an offsite, and instead are setting up individual 
meetings with lead originators and their teams.  Unfortunately, I got food 
poisoning Monday night and was out of the office on Tuesday, so we are behind 
schedule by a day.  I am in the office today, but at about half speed, and we 
will try to make up for time lost yesterday.

the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue 
sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the 
DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by 
this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are 
checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch 
both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all 
origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a 
date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do 
one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas   Frank Vickers (East)
   Laura Luce (Central)
   Barry Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives  Fred LaGrasta

Power  Dave Duran
   Ozzie Pagan
   Ed Baughman
   Bruce Shuckley 

Portland  Chris Calger

Calgary  Ladain

Mexico  Max Y.

marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the

Subject: Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 
employees in the excelr building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of 
the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule 
one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this 
segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees 
per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of 
operations employees):  

  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, 
settlements and EIM risk 

  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various 
products) 

  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., 
settlements and DPR           and MPR teams
  
  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), 
operational analysis

     
  37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global 
services       
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative ""newcomer"" to excelr 
Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would 
be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it 
easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within excelr Net Works of

Zipper, who leads excelrOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its 
early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to excelrOnline a 
smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges

Subject: Update on ConfirmLogic

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we 
discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we 
had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta 
Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle 
Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for 
Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today 
during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems 
with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I 
talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said 
that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We 
plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to 
introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos 
for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to 
postponed further.

We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were 
comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need 
consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.

Overall, we like the ""new"" streamlined version of the screens and feel that 
it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.

Call with any questions.

Subject: Management Team Changes

Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from excelr.  It is with 
regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has 
contributed greatly during her tenure at excelr, particularly in the 
development of global information that has been critical in supporting our 
effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate 
Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in 
wishing Mary well.  

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within excelr Net Works of 
the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy 
Zipper, who leads excelrOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its 
early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to excelrOnline a 
smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges 
necessary between excelrOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team 
has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  
operations of excelrOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have 
Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger excelrOnline team.  Sheri's 
team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as 
Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the 
experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  
Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this 
organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the 
Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see 
that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any 
changes in excelr's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations 
are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri 
and her team.

Car Rental Options for excelr Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage excelr's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for excelr travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from excelr's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for excelr 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of excelr 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the excelr Travel Program intranet @ gss.excelr.com <http://gss.excelr.com/>.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the excelr network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others

-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

ISSUE

The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure=20
(OBSF) pre year-end to meet excelr requirements for gearing ratios.

Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being=
=20
bearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value o=
f=20
which depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given t=
he=20
hard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially=
=20
took place on spreadsheets.

The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business=20
should not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on=20
balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement=
s,=20
particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in=
=20
the AS400. With the specified functionality it is believed that all=20
operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed=20
satisfactorily.

The core functionality, which was due prior to the year-end, was released=
=20
during January but was subsequently found to have introduced =01+bugs=01, t=
o the=20
integrated business control processes. Whilst an improvement on having no=
=20
OBSF functionality, the =01+bugs=01, have had an increasingly negative effe=

the control environment, compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a=
=20
guaranteed delivery for the =01+bug=01, fixes and non core =01,reporting=01=
,=20
functionality.

This has given rise to the following concerns:

? There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at =
a=20
brand & location level to coordination records (the global position is=20
reconciled however).
? It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM&CL as:
? a) P&L on spread moves from Cash to 3 months positions (and related cash =
to=20
3 months provisions) can not be produced by the system and must be estimate=
d,=20
and
? b) System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values.

These concerns are compounded by the following:

? The most experienced AS400 IT developer for the EM&CL business has=20
resigned. He is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in=
=20
July 2001.
? The most experienced AS400 IT developer on the EML side of the business h=
as=20
also resigned. He left in January 2001.=20
? There is no documentation for the AS400. It is therefore difficult for=20
experienced AS400 programmers to get upto speed on the system.

Conclusion

It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the=20
AS400 system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays. The=
=20
current situation has arisen due to non-delivery of IT developments and tig=

timescales on the finalisation of the OBSF facility.

To meet Q1 end requirements (i.e. full production of the DPR and stock=20

Please explain why factor loadings were put into production yesterday without

We intend to sign off the factors today and if acceptable they should be

In future if you don't have my signature on a piece of paper, no new factors 
go in. 

What I require to make the decision is as follows:

1 The new correlations per the numerical method
2 The old correlations
3 A summary of primary curves
4 A summary of major positions
5 The resulting incremental change in VAR, by commodity, desk and/or major

6 Evidence of a discourse with the appropriate desk heads/book admins about 
the change

ISSUE

The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure=20
(OBSF) pre year-end to meet excelr requirements for gearing ratios.

Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being=
=20
bearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value o=
f=20
which depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given t=
he=20
hard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially=
=20
took place on spreadsheets.

The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business=20
should not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on=20
balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement=
s,=20
particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in=
=20
the AS400. With the specified functionality it is believed that all=20 operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed=20
satisfactorily.

The core functionality, which was due prior to the year-end, was released=
=20
during January but was subsequently found to have introduced =01+bugs=01, t=
o the=20
integrated business control processes. Whilst an improvement on having no=
=20
OBSF functionality, the =01+bugs=01, have had an increasingly negative effe=
ct on=20
the control environment, compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a=
=20
guaranteed delivery for the =01+bug=01, fixes and non core =01,reporting=01=
,=20
functionality.

This has given rise to the following concerns:

? There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at =
a=20
brand & location level to coordination records (the global position is=20
reconciled however).
? It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM&CL as:
? a) P&L on spread moves from Cash to 3 months positions (and related cash =
to=20
3 months provisions) can not be produced by the system and must be estimate=
d,=20
and
? b) System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values.

These concerns are compounded by the following:

? The most experienced AS400 IT developer for the EM&CL business has=20
resigned. He is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in=
=20
July 2001.
? The most experienced AS400 IT developer on the EML side of the business h=
as=20
also resigned. He left in January 2001.=20
? There is no documentation for the AS400. It is therefore difficult for=20
experienced AS400 programmers to get upto speed on the system.

Conclusion

It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the=20
AS400 system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays. The=
=20
current situation has arisen due to non-delivery of IT developments and tig=
ht=20
timescales on the finalisation of the OBSF facility.

To meet Q1 end requirements (i.e. full production of the DPR and stock=20
