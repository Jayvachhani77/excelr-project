Controller forum set for October 22, 23 and 24.  I want to send the official 
invitation early next week.  I have conferred with Mike on attendees from 
EEL.   Since I do not know all of the reporting relationships in London, I 
did want to share this list with you and get your input as well before it is 
finalized.  Please let me know your thoughts on attendees per the attached.  

Mike was not sure that you would want to be included, but I certainly want to 
invite you and would very much welcome your attendance.  If you can come, I 
would be great for you to address the group if you would like to do so.  Just 
let me know.  Jeff Skilling, Rick Causey, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford are 
confirmed as speakers, and I am waiting to hear from Mark Frevert on his 
participation.  I expect to sent a preliminary agenda out for review next 
week as well, and would welcome your comments on that.  

Hope you have a great weekend.  --Sally

Please update the following items for Project Doorstep:

Observation:  Term transactions executed via EOL do not automatically bridge 
into the capture systems thus increasing the amount of transactions manually 
captured.

Status: The bridge from EOL to Sitara for term transactions was placed into 
production on September 21st.  This item is now completed.

For your information, we are planning to complete our Enpower testing today 
and are working with Houston to go into production tomorrow.  I will let you

This memo apparently was already out on e:mail when we were meeting in my 
office regarding confirmations.  The language regarding Jeff's role on 
financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo.  It wasn't  
clear to me when we met whether Scott and Leslie had talked while looking at 
a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on e:mail.  Since you said 
that you had not seen this memo, please follow up with Scott, Leslie and Jeff 
to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and 
settlements so that can be communicated within the organization.  There 
should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms 
and settlements.  This memo as sent will create that confusion.  Thanks.

Dear Shawn,

It is unfortunate Tom did not bring up these points when the three of us 
discussed this on Monday.  I am unclear as to whether the work AA was 
planning to do on power is for their internal or external purposes as when 
asked directly Jennifer Stevenson said that it was for both audits (which, as 
you know, is frowned upon by the SEC).

In fact, Stacey was not part of the Doorstep team.  Additionally Risk 
Operations (myself) did not set up or perform the deal test.  Instead, this 
test was set up by AA and performed by members of RAC.  This can be 
considered a internal audit for AA's purposes.

Although it seemed that we had an agreement on Monday, it now looks as if 
you, Tom and I need to meet again and establish some additional ground rules 
in order to eliminate duplication of work.

Sally,

Let's reserve that last weekend.  Saturday would be fine with me.  You need
to know that I got an email from Cara--she's had a couple of offers for
showers--and is having a hard time deciding what to do (hmm...what a
surprise!).  Anyway, am not sure where our offer stands--we'll see.  I told
her to do whatever is best for her (while thinking:  if she doesn't choose
our shower invitation it will affect my gift!)

Will try to pin her down...

Cindy

Late Jan sounds great.  Meagan does have a couple of big things on the
weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation (big
dance that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and
a winter party for Cotillion.  I believe that these are three weekends in a
row, January 6, 13 and 20th.  So the last weekend in January would work
well (and I will need a rest from formal affairs!).  Does that work for
you?  And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday?  Saturday probably
works better for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by
Sunday afternoon!!

We didn't really cover the role you intended to play with EES and EBS as far 
as Doorstep is concerned when we met with Causey/Buy.  (Or I just can't 
remember.) May we include EES and EBS in the scope of our one Doorstep 
project, and continue to work with Shona, also coordinating with Wanda and 
Barry when EES and EBS are involved?  Things like the event below might make 
us re-consider our need to visit ""origination"" offices.  I don't think this

LTV Steel, a counterparty of Clinton Gas, which is a subsidiary of EES went 
bankrupt. EES exposure is ~$6 million. This transaction has not been approved

I think the idea of finding  an efficient way to reference this effort as an 
excelr-wide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all 
locations and all commodities traded is great - and I would hope to reference 
it via the reporting process that shona is trying to roll out.

I will work with Shona who undoubtedly would want to send out ( in your name

Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts 
on the cover note ?  

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message ( it is a European note )and the means of delivery.  On 
the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully 
understand the intent.  Is there an article to be included in an excelr 
publication ( yes )and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if 
so, to whom will the letter be sent)?  Or is the letter from John an 
introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?  ( Yes - apologies 
if there is confusion )

With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure excelr top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
excelr to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  
Agreed - but the note was targeted at Europe - would welcome the opportunity 
to work on this with you and Shona )

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  Can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to 
Shona

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally  - Certainly not  - and thanks

recently, one in Dallas and one in San Antonio.  We have been making the 
Texas circuit -- not quite as exciting as your travels.  

I have heard from Stephanie, and she, Paul and Rebecca are headed to Texas at 
the end of October/beginning of November.  She will be interviewing students 
at UT on October 30 and 31 and then she and her family will be in Houston 
from Wesneday, November 1 to Saturday, November 4.  They will be staying with 
us at our house.  It will be fun to watch Tyler and Rebecca get to know one 
another!  She is an older woman, but I am sure that they do well.  By the 
way, Stephanie is expecting baby number two -- I think that when she is here 
she will be about six months pregnant.  

I thought that I would let you know what her travel plans are on the off 
chance that you might be in Houston at that time.  It would be fun for all of 
us to get together.  I don't know if I had told you, but Chuck Randall has

introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?  ( Yes - apologies 
if there is confusion )

With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure excelr top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
excelr to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  
Agreed - but the note was targeted at Europe - would welcome the opportunity 
to work on this with you and Shona )

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  Can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to 
Shona

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally  - Certainly not  - and thanks

Subject: Global Standards - additional info

I've received some feedback from some of you concerning the depth of the 
global standards as attached.  These standards are meant to represent basic, 
high level standards that each office must adhere to.  Additionally, these 
standards are applicable to each and every business excelr has.  They are not 
meant to be an exhaustive list of all excelr standards. 

I believe that each of you will have additional standards for which you would 
like to establish exception reporting that are focused to your individual 
business.  We can certainly discuss these, and possibly incorporate them as 
additional standards once these basics are addressed (a possible ""phase II"").

I'm in London this week and you can reach me at 44 777 528 3633 if you want 
to discuss this with me.

Thanks,

Shona



As I discussed in the staff meeting, I am sending you the global standards 
for your review and comment.  Please review these standards to determine if:

The targets set are reasonable for your business and
As minimum standards, they are comprehensive enough (if you would like to see 
additional reporting)

Lastly, in the upcoming month we will start to implement exception reporting 
for these standards.  Please let us know who the key contact in your 
department would be for this implementation.

Please address all correspondence to Michael Moscoso.

Thank you,

Shona

Subject: Further note on access of operating standards

Fernley:  I think that you are right about easy access to the standards.  In 
fact, at the Global Operations Controllers gathering in Houston in October, 
we are going to roll out a website created for Global Risk Operations.  The 
global standards will be one of the items included, as well as contact lists 
for Operations Controllers worldwide, calendars for all excelr offices 
worldwide, a ""what time is it there if I am here"" page, etc.  I would like 
for this to be introduced at the offsite as surprise (just a little bang out 
of the announcement) , so I would appreciate your not sharing this plan 
widely at this point.  However, I thought that I would let you know so that 
we would not duplicate any efforts.

25221,beck-s/all_documents/139.,<22465370.1075849814198.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Here's a summary of our conversation so you have points to follow up with.

General Status of the Database model: 
 FIX not represented - need to incorporate into common design and standardize 
- might cause some FIX rework.
 Referential Integrity not entirely enforced  - potential for bad data to 
develop. 
 Snapshots from Global databases are currently daily - this can be easily 
changed to be more frequent, but need to consider implementation as 
decision   on direction of Global as a part of Commodity Logic is made. 
 Rate information not developed - need integration with Rate Server or MKM, 
preferably MKM. Need to define how MKM will be used-whether just for index  
names or to obtain actual settlement prices or curves as well.
 Application development is not currently occurring on a single version of 
the database.  Therefore, some issues could arise as each development team   
migrates to the standard. This needs to happen relatively quickly.

Specific Issues:
 GFD_PIPE_METERS_SNP -  Probably need to add FAC_TYPE (WH, ITE, etc) for 
possible use as validation in KX functionality
 GAS_DEAL_LOCATION_DTL -  This table refers to facility number rather than 
pipe and meter.  Facility number is an excelrism that no other company 
will      recognize.  
 Pipe and Meter General -   Should try to avoid using Pipe_Cd as key.  This 
value needs to be updateable as pipelines are bought and sold.
    -   Data for Facilities is heavily dependent upon excelr Global Facilities 
Database in current design and functionality-this      needs revisiting as 
the decision surrounding Global is made 
 CP_ADDR_VW  - This table references only internal_cp_id and contact_type_cd 
in conjunction with address_id.  Addresses are specific to      
internal_cp_id, product_cd, deal_nature_cd, contact_type_cd, and region_cd.  
Need to add deal nature, product, and      region to ensure correct address 
usage since many companies align their business along these determinants 
and      addresses may vary
 COUNTERPARTY - There is a mixture of the usage of Global Counterparty.  Some 
areas indicate a certain amount of independence from      excelr's Global 
Counterparty system, by having a table to capture Commodity Logic information 
on a counterparty such      as phone numbers, credit ratings, etc. This would 
position CL to become independent at a later date.  Yet, Commodity      Logic 
functions as a subset of excelr Networks and GCP must make entries to indicate 
the usage of a customer by excelr      Networks to obtain an SAP id and 
support payment processing through to SAP.  So, CL could not become 
independent      without further functionality or process changes.  So why 
not put the added data requirements within GCP to start with?   If      
Global moves to Commodity Logic, then this design needs to be revisited for 
sure.  There should probably be some      standardization between 
dependence/independence whether or not CL separates from excelr. 
 Common Data  - Status is not included in the views being utilized by the 
applications.  I hope the views have been filtered for active       status 
only.  Show was going to check on this.
    - Concept of mapping others' codes to ours for processing, is not 
supported anywhere in these tables.  Perhaps       that has been handled in 
an isolated manner in the FIX design? This will have to be there for internal 
release as well as      external release.  This is critical to the hub 
concept.

I look forward to sitting in on your meetings surrounding these issues.  Let 
me know if you have further questions.

I am asking my assistant, Lauren to set up a video conference to discuss the 
support services that excelr Europe is providing and how we
should move forward to make these more responsive to your needs, as well as 
more efficient.   We will have a number of classic ""centralized versus 
decentralized"" matters to resolve and I doubt if one size will fit all.  Keep 
in mind that we have no desire to expand our empire.  In fact, from our 
perspective if our non-commerical headcount got smaller it would be a great 
outcome.  But the way it is has been going lately, we have been adding 
non-commerical headcount at a record pace at the same time that each of us is 
trying to massively expand our commercial business.  

We put a freeze on non-commerical hires earlier this week while we try and 
assess our space limitations and plan for the 2001 budge, so this is 
important that we get your perspective soon on what will work for you.

Global Markets has already moved some of these services under Brent Price in 
Houston but there are many other services which we need to consider as well 
such as:
IT development
IT infrastructure
RAC
Credit
Risk Management
Legal
Accounts Payable
Tax
Building Services
Analyst & Associate recruiting
Senior recruiting
Expat services
Other HR
PR
Governmental Relations
SFA relations
Finance

I hate to think that we will need to form a committee to work this issue, but 
that is a possibility.  If you have any suggestions for a process for working
these issues through, please send them out to this group or bring them to our 
upcoming meeting.

Here is what I put together for the Doorstep schedule. All the offices are 
planned for dates, but I've only matched people with offices through 1Q 
2001.  I have not yet met with Sally regarding any changes she may have for 
Risk operations personnel.  However, it would be great if you could determine

hard. I imagine David is starting to feel a little cocky, given we should be
undefeated going into Texas, but he may still need to seek the shelter of
the study, as I know Texas is not going to roll over and play dead.

Sounds like Meagan has a full agenda this Fall and a trip to Norman would
only get in the way. I'm sure David will not let the fire die, if she is
truly interested in OU. FYI, OU's Spring Break is March 17-25 next year. So
you can plan accordingly. Let me know if you decide when you decide to come
up and I can get you lined up with Prospective Student Services for a tour.
Also, I remember you telling me about your concerns about grades. I know
that OU requires a 24 on the ACT, or finish in the top 1/3 of your
graduating class. It is my understanding that will soon be increasing to 26
or top 30% of graduating class. Looks like OU is following UT on tightening
entrance requirements.

I can get you shirts caps, sweatshirts, etc. for OU, UT and Tech. You can go
to Bigtimesports.com and look at the styles. I think they are also in the
school colors. If you see a style you like, let me know the size shape and
school and I can order it. If some of it is for you, let me know, as they
have different styles for women. Also, I can have logo's etc. reduced (like
I did on your Bevo on your shirt) so they are not so big. I always have them
reduce the OU from 1 3/4"" to a
1 1/4"" size, so I don't look like a ""poster boy"" for OU. Anyway, let me know
and I will order them for you.

Let me know when you hear back from Lexi about your discussion relative to
summer internship recruiting.

Thanks for looking into the OU/Texas tickets for us.  With the ages of the
kids, I think that we will pass on those single tickets.  The kids love our
home tradition for the game, and weren't sure that they wanted to give that
up. (I have cake pans in the shape of the state of Texas and the state of
Oklahoma - one daugther decorates one, and the other decorates the second
cake - add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate
party!)

We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on
that last game of the season. However, Klein High School has started the
football season very strongly, winning all games to date.  That means that
we may be headed for high school playoffs again this year.  Meagan is on
the drill team and must be at all games.  Last year, we played right up to
Thanksgiving in the playoffs.  So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the
spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with
Meagan.

We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.  Do you
have a list of what is available for those schools?

As far as Texas tickets go, I can come up with 5 singles, but not 5

It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week.  As always, I
appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards.
I am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody
and Nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table.  You have
done a great job in changing and promoting the program.

I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer
interns ASAP.  I have also left Mike McConnell a message to make him aware
of the issue.  I should be able to get back with you next week, hopefully
with a change in our strategy!

If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets, please let me know.  We
will certainly purchase them, I just made the assumption that all tickets
may already be sold.

On another note, David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of
compliments.  He has a number of people that have asked him about school
shirts, caps, etc.  Do you have a list of the schools that you can get
merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get?  Let me know

you have listed, he wants to include only Cindy Horn.  

I have thought more about Heidi Mason and Jan-Erland and think that they 
should be included.  While they do roll into Europe and also have a tie to 
accounting, they are the individuals in Sydney and Toyko that we are 
depending on to stress and enforce controls.  Heidi particularly does have 
active responsibility for risk, confirmations and settlements on a day-to-day 
basis.  And in addtion to their role reporting in to Europe, we are looking 
to them to oversee controls for other non-EEL traded commodities in their 
locations - weather, coal, etc.

I will include Fernley on the invitation list, as I had mentioned the meeting 
to him when I saw him in San Antonio.  He can certainly respectfully 
decline!

25242,beck-s/all_documents/1409.,<15832461.1075855778584.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"The cause of this was the timing of when SAP went down.  SAP had a major 
system crash the day Willie finaled his supply verification in Unify.  Before 
Willie went into SAP to net the payable (same day), SAP crashed.  By the time 
SAP came up, the treasury run had already picked up the payable and wired the 
cash.  When we issued the recall, the money was already out the door.

As a result, we put a policy in place that all supply verifications for 
netout customers must be overridden as soon as they are finaled in Unify.  
This causes them to be blocked in SAP and not picked up by treasury until the 
payment block is removed.  This policy went into effect at the beginning of 
September.  

However, this still relies on human intervention to ensure the procedure 
works.  To ensure we don't ""accidentally"" release cash, I have asked Unify IT 
to change the interface to send all purchases for ENA to SAP blocked, which 
will require the coordinator to release funds.  This is an added step, but is 
worth it considering the stakes.  This change will go into effect on Monday, 
9/25.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Willie,

Per our earlier conversation, can you or Audrey or Bryce, please give further 
explain to me as to why the funds were wired to Perry Gas for purchases from 
the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales.  
You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty's that net on 
SAP, although because of timing, the override did not take place.

Thank you,

database, we have been working to present the data in compelling ways.  We 
have started to do this by creating the VaR Limit Usage graphs and the 
Sharpe, Rovar, and Risk - Return graphs.  

I am sorry for the misunderstanding with Ted concerning the latter.  I had 
explained what I wanted to produce in an e-mail and during a Risk Forum 
Luncheon.  Therefore, Shona and I did not expect the reaction we got.  I have 
talked to Naveen and Rudi since then, and we have changed the graphs to be 
agreeable to RAC.

Today I worked on the graphs below.  They show the P&L decomposition for the 
month (rolling 20 business days) up to 9/20 (one in dollar terms and the 
other as a percentage of P&L).  I showed them to Shona, and she thought you 
should see them before Naveen, Rudi, and Ted, because these graphs are very 
powerful and are likely to be controversial.  The graphs show that European 
Gas and UK Power released a lot of prudency.  Half of total P&L for European 
Gas is prudency, and UK Power would have had a loss of about $20 million 
(instead of a gain of $27 million) were it not for prudency.   In the case of 
North American Gas, $46 million gain in new deals partly offset about $106 
million in trading losses.  

Please note that these are rough drafts intended to show what we can do.  I 
do not think that there are problems with the data, but I threw these 
together today, and I have not yet double-checked the accuracy of my 
aggregating calculations.

Please launch the attached spreadsheet, and feel free to call or page me with 
questions or concerns.

Thank you,

rescheduled meeting with AA on risk controls.  That is on my calendar for 
Friday morning this week, so I will bring copies with me to that meeting.  

I have been publishing an ENA operations report monthly since June.  To date, 
I have been reviewing it with Dave Delainey, fine-tuning each month the types 
of information and format that he likes.  I will bring you a copy tomorrow 
and would like your input on content and format as well.  With the recent 
reorganization, I am working with EGM and EIM to create the same report.  
After we have mastered that here in Houston over the next month or so, I plan 
to share the format with London so that all of our wholesale businesses can 
use the same format.  

In addition to these monthly operating reports, we are working on a daily 
report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track 
compliance with our fundamental operating standards.  We are in the phase of 
determining the source of reporting (systematic or manual) and the frequency 
of reporting (daily, weekly, monthly) for all commodities and locations 
against the operating standards.  As we get this to a first draft stage, I 
will share this with you, as well as the timeline for full implementation.

that I should review the resumes, pass them to Brent for his review, and then 
on to Causey for his review.  Considering our schedules and the large number 
of resumes to review, that would have been an impossible task to complete by 
Thursday at noon.  I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday, just before 
leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma.  I asked Patti to 
make a copy of the packet for Brent, and I knew that Rick would not want to 
take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening 
first.  I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way 
back to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of 
the business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training 
class.  We got those to Rick today by noon, as he was leaving the office.  I 
believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will 
pass the resumes along to you.  Since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this 
morning after Brent and I had done our reviews, you will have to 
cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.  

Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the 
resumes as well.  I would suggest that in the future that your team should 
make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the 
review.  The plan of passing them from one person to another is not 
practical,  and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.  If you 
are going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time 
frame, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.  If someone from 
you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that 
would have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes.  
Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes 
of MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not 
Analysts interviews.  Please give us organized information to react to, not 
simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.  All of us want to 
participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process, but 
we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and 
organizational work.  

I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program 
and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role, not being 
critical.  I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.

Jeff Skilling mentioned today that gas volume growth in ENA was still about 
97% year on year.
I don't know how much of this is increased number of trades and how much is 
increased volume per trade.

We are currently preparing a zero-base estimate of future support costs to 
assess the benefits v costs of all projects.
Assuming that the business in Europe will develop in a similar way to 
America, but a few years behind, it would be most useful to have some more 
statistics for several years back.
Who in your team has some more statistics on numbers of trades which could 
help us?

Rick, Rick,

There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by excelr, acted much as trading offices. They are very 
small.
We have worked with the people in Metals to put in place extra controls so 
that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in a 
designated Trading Office own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate (get a price from a Trading Office for every deal), and some 
execute for Trading Offices (are given a range within which they can execute 
trades).

 is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
Tab 'Office Models' shows which functions are performed in which type of 
office
Tab 'Office List' shows the actual offices involved 
We propose to re-examine this methodology in 6 months' time.
Buy-in has been obtained from the cc list and the people on the ground.

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Are you both happy with this approach?
Are there any extra controls you would like to see in place?

Thanks,
Richard

Subject: Genoil addition to MPR

Shona
 We have had issues in the past with Canada not informing us of all of their 
Merchant investments.  For six months we chased Invasion Debt and finally 
received enough information to put it on the MPR in August (only after it was 
placed in Raptor I).  Also, about six months ago, John Lavorato asked about 
an asset called CNR Warrants that showed up on the ""hot list"" but we were 
told by Canada that they were going to sell it so they did not want it on the 
MPR.  Today, we were told that Kyle Kitagawa wanted to sell an asset called 
Genoil (approx. 4.7 million shares).  Again, we did not know that they owned 
this investment.  We have contacted Donna Lowry about Genoil because Beau 
Canada is on the restricted list and think Genoil would be, too.
 A trip to Canada may be necessary in order to reinforce our full disclosure 
policies regarding the MPR.  Please let me know if I can provide any 
additional information.

Ladies,

To the best of my knowledge, this is the list of items and next steps we 
outlined in our meeting:

1)  ZICI--if errors are made in entry, you must exit and rebook to create a 
2-sided entry.  Diana McLaughlin to review.

2)  ZICI--Prepays on intercompany foreign invoices.  Laurel to contact Pamela 
Lebrane and establish a game plan.

3)  ZICR--report to identify items to be reallocated by trading partner.  Ana 
to create--Rena/Diana to assist if necessary.

4)  BAI codes for activity in Citibank London :  Laurel and Phyllis to 
contact Brian Silver and Lisa Raye

5)  EURO account--items sent back from the bank and posted in USD 
equivalents.  Treasury has been notified and is researching.  Laurel & 
Phyllis to follow up.

6)  ""Not to be posted"" cash.  This causes problems with Cash Application, and 
receivables.  Phyllis/Rena to follow up with Brian Silver & Lori Scott

7)  Autoclear Inflo account--Rena to talk with Becky Ford about putting this 
on as a scheduled overnight job.

8)  Outflow account--Laurel, Cynthia, and Phyllis to continue researching 
outstanding items.  

9)  Yen--Brian Silver & Lori Scott.  Need a solution quickly, as JPY activity 
is increasing--we just had a trader move over to Japan.  

I THINK I covered everything we talked about.   Please feel free to correct 
me!!

Subject: Upcoming Compensation Analysis


To All Energy Operations Directors:

My name is Todd Burke and I'm a Compensation Specialist with ENA Human 
Resources (see attached bio).  As you know, Sally Beck has requested that I 
conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current pay arrangements for all 
Energy Operations staff.  The purpose of this analysis will be to ensure that 
the department's current pay arrangements are in line with the competitive 
marketplace.  Each component of pay will be examined individually and within 
the context of excelr's compensation philosophy (e.g., base salary, bonus, 
long-term incentives and total compensation).

The process will begin with a series of interviews which will be conducted in 
two stages:  

Stage 1-Data Gathering:  the focus of this stage will be upon gathering data 
around your perceptions of your group's current pay arrangements and give you 
the opportunity to address any of the internal and external inequities you 
perceive to exist.  

Stage 2-Job Matching:  the focus of this stage will be on job matching - we 
will establish a mutually agreed upon time to meet and discuss which 
positions in our salary surveys most accurately reflect the roles and 
responsibilities of your staff.  We will not be able to match 100 percent of 
your jobs to the jobs contained in the salary surveys.  Non-benchmark jobs 
will be reviewed using a job ""slotting"" approach.

To help facilitate the matching process, I will be assembling handouts 
containing the job descriptions taken from the relevant salary surveys which 
I will send to each of you in advance of our Stage 2 meeting.  The intent 
here is to give you the opportunity to ""pre-match"" your respective jobs 
thereby minimizing the time required to achieve this objective during our 
Stage 2 meeting.  It will be critical that you are comfortable with the 
matches that you agree to as these matches will be used when gathering 
relevant market data.  The data will only be as good as the matches.

Following the conclusion of Stage 2, I can begin gathering the market data 
based on the results of the job matching exercise and prepare a comparative 
analysis that I will be presenting to Sally Beck.

I will be contacting each of you in the next few days to set up the Stage 1 
interviews.  I look forward to working with each of you and to the successful 
completion of this project.

Please call with any questions or comments.  I can be reached at X39437.  

Kind Regards,

Todd Burke

the sale of HPL as the start of this.  Leslie and I worked on an org chart 
(positions/functions only) for him one evening this week (copy attached).  
Now he would like for us to draft an agreement, with associated costs, to 
provide to these potential buyers.  The IT services would also be provided, 
and the draft of that agreement is also attached.

I have a starting point for us, using the Bridgeline Services agreement (copy 
attached).  We learned alot on the Bridgeline model and it is important for 
us to learn from those issues and avoid them for this deal.   Additionally, I 
have asked Shari Mao to put together costs of salaries and other associated 
costs for the positions listed on the org chart.  We should view the costs 
from the perspective that the infrastructure is a stand-alone entity.  All 
costs that would be incurred as a stand-alone should be recovered in the 
bid.  The meeting on Monday will be a working meeting to ensure we have 
addressed all concerns and issues, and ensure the bid is appropriate.  Brian 
has not been specific on the due date for this, just ""sometime next week.""  I 
talked with Patrick Wade, and he felt Wednesday (9/20) should be the target.

Subject: Problems with Morning Cashflow process

Hi Jonathan,

 Listed below are the details of each days problems:

Fri, Sep 8,2000
AutoRho failed at 3:15am, uploaded only 8 books into Infinity.
It failed on the step in AutoRho where it runs the query to get all the books 
for the Infinity USD portfolio.  Jeremy does not know exactly what caused it 
but rerunning AutoRho seemed to work.
Recovery used the backup file and was on time.

Tue, Sep 12,2000
Similar problem to Friday, but ENPOWER also failed.  The manenpower.txt file 
had TNS errors in it.  AutoRho was not able to kick off the ENPOWER script to 
get the cashflows.  Rerunning fixed the problem.
AutoRho failed at 3:15am, uploaded only 9 books into Infinity.
It failed on the step in AutoRho where it runs the query to get all the books 
for the Infinity USD portfolio.  Jeremy does not know exactly what caused it 
but rerunning AutoRho seemed to work.
Recovery used the file that Jeremy provided in the rerun, they were 
approximately 10 minutes late.

Wed, Sep 13,2000
ENPOWER failed creating a header ONLY manenpower.txt file.  There was no 
cashflows in the file.
Jeremy confirmed the Autorho process was fine.
The problem was the ENPOWER databse failed (hardrive failure) and they 
immediately went to a backup.  But on the backup database, NOT all the tables 
are replicated.  The cashlow table with the ENPOWER data we needed was not in 
the backup database resulting in a file with zero flows!
This problem has been fixed by the enpower people.
Recovery included using the previous day's enpower flows.  They were on time.

Thurs, Sep 14,2000
AutoRho at 3:15 am and 11:00 pm was hung.  Enpower also was not run since 
AutoRho failed.
Reason was because the UNIX NFS file system ""solar"" was full  As a result, 
our directory /worksheets2, and also /prod/egs-home is mounted on solar but 
could not write anything to it.  Supposily the SA are suppose to have been 
paged when ever a file system gets close to 100% (can you please confirm 
this?).  The Unix NFS was fixed by 5:00 am.  AutoRho was rerun and was fine.
Recovery included Jeremy's file.  They were 1 hour late (partly due to other 
reasons on MO side, not system related).

Thanks,

I am so excited to see you and your family.  For your written
records...we'll in be Austin from Oct 27- Oct 31.  Then, we'll travel to
Houston via the Blue Bell ice cream factory on Nov 1st -- our plane leaves
from Houston on Sat, Nov 4th about 12:30.  Doing something on Friday with
Rebecca and Tyler sounds great -- she's pretty much up for anything.

Let me know what you hear from Mo -- it would be wonderful to see her, too.
Paul and I were starting to worry that something bad had happened in her
life!  It has been so long since we have talked to her.

This week's issue of Business Week has excelr in a list of the top 50
companies who are making the Internet work for them in running their
business  -- the focus for excelr was on the different trading operations,
highlighting trading broadband capacity.  I read BW weekly and excelr seems
to be in there a lot.

Take Care,

study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President.  
This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.

It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the 
Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists 
and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.  I learned recently that Yvonne 
has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and 
above.

Todd Burke, who recently joined excelr, will be conducting the market survey 
and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful 
experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are 
fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient 
thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of 
your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the 
analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a 
vested interest in the success of this project!

Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and 
below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of 
Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for 
key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate 
further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.

You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will 
detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.

After speaking with Richard Burchfield and Brian Hudson, I thought that it 
would be appropriate to update both of you and Beth as to IT's commitment.  
Richard asked that he send out the message and I agreed.  One reason for 
doing this was to show that the Operations and IT groups are working together 
towards a common goal.  The other reason was to ensure that I had IT's buy-in 
to completing this database in a timely fashion.

Our main goal will be to deliver the basic tools that any trading business 
would need and then to continue to develop the more advanced analytics in Q1 
2001.  The actual roll out will happen in phases prior to January so that we 
begin the new year with a complete database which includes deal capture, 
valuation, and the necessary reporting and accounting tools.  By using Brian 
Hudson's IT team I can be assured that the global needs are met.

I will be in the office next week if you want to discuss this further,

Subject: Weather

Todd,
 Per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a Weather 
Trading and Valuation engine.  I have discussed the high level requirements 
with Joseph Koothrappaly and have identified an IT lead to manage the 
project. As discussed, the project will have the same project formula as the 
""Thunderball"" project with 3-6 month deliverables. Also, the need to have 
co-operative development between Houston and London will be established for 
Global roll out of the Weather system. The main focus will be a intranet 
trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine. The plan calls 
for Phase I roll out for January 1, 2001.   Next steps will need to be 
discuss as soon as possible.  Topics that need to be addressed are definition 
of Phase I, joint development between Houston and London, and duel 
development between Steve Stock's valuation team and my trading team. Keep in 
mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments, one person 
will manage the effort across teams.

25305,beck-s/all_documents/1467.,<21980329.1075855780077.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"To All EMSA students,

Attached are two versions (Word and Power Point) of a flier regarding the
excelr Informational Meeting next Tuesday (September 19th).

As the flier states, Mike McConnell, an OU graduate and a graduate of this
program (formerly known as PLM), will be the main speaker. Mike is a former
landman and is a very dynamic speaker. Mike recently assumed the position of
President and CEO of excelr Global Markets, L.L.C.. Though many of you have
heard him before. Mike has a completely new and exciting power point
presentation he will give. Not only will he talk about new things going on
at excelr and in the energy business, he will also discuss what is going on
in Exploration & Production too. It is my understanding he will also give a
fascinating demonstration about excelr On-Line ( excelr's revolutionary idea
that has completely changed the way gas and other commodities are now
traded).

I realize many of you have night classes (i.e.. Oil and Gas Law, etc) and
cannot miss it. However, you need to plan on attending the social, after
class, at Coach's. Jody Crook, Sally Beck (Vice President of Energy
Operations) and  Lexi Elliott (excelr's new college recruiter) will be here,
along with other excelr representatives, to meet and visit with you about
career opportunities with excelr and discuss questions you might have about
the energy industry in general.

Also, excelr will have a booth at the Career Fair the following day
(Wednesday, Sept. 20th). You should also plan on going to that and visiting
with them and the other companies that will also be on campus to look at EM
students too. This will give you a good comparison of what type of
opportunities that are out there and to compare the management styles of
each of these companies. I know that excelr invites comparison, as they have
obviously been very successful with their style.

Again, I expect all of you that do not have class conflicts, or try to make
arrangements to have someone cover for your class,  to attend all or at
least the social part of this presentation. Needless to say, excelr, and
especially Mike McConnell, are taking the time and expense to come up and
visit with you and to look at this program. It was this program and both Ms.
Beck's and Mr. McConnell's support, that first brought excelr to OU. We need
to make the same type of commitment to them and show them how much we
appreciate excelr's support of our program and the hiring of OU students. The
new ""Participation Point  Policy"" will be in effect for this and attendance
and non-excused absences will be noted.

For your information, this week is the week to sign up for excelr interviews,
through the Career Services website. excelr is scheduled to be here on
Monday, October 9th for first round interviews. If you make it to the second
round, those will take place on Tuesday, October 10th. So be aware of your
schedule to allow for interview times for both Monday and possible Tuesday
when interviewing with excelr.

Should you have any questions, or have problems opening these attachments,
please let me know.

See you at the EMSA meeting on Sunday night (e-mail coming) and next week at
""An Evening with excelr"".

1. Introduction

We are planning to launch version 2.0 of excelrOnline to customers within th=
e=20
next few days.  In preparation for this launch, the new web site will be=20
released to internal users in North America on Wednesday, September 13th. =
=20
European internal users will be launched shortly after North America. =20
External customers will follow a few days later.=20

One of the purposes of the internal launch is to simulate the system load=
=20
which will be caused by the full customer launch.  Accordingly, we apprecia=
te=20
your cooperation in helping us to simulate this load by logging into=20
http://prod.excelronline.com (no www.)  This is a live web site and all trad=
es=20
are real.

New features (as per recent presentations and training sessions) include:

? Price limit orders
? Enhanced customization
? Floating windows
? Market news and quotes
? Weather maps and tables
? Industry-specific publications
? Market-specific homepages

2. Version 2.0 Launch Date
excelrOnline Version 2.0 will be launched to the public a few days after our=
=20
internal launch. We  will be using the new version internally from Wednesda=
y,=20
Sept. 13. This will provide an opportunity for you to become familiar with=
=20
using the new application in the production environment before our customer=
s=20
start to use it.

3. New Website Feature Details

Price limit orders: Customers have the ability to set up orders that=20
automatically execute as soon as the price and volume requested become=20
available. The limit orders remain open in the system until they are=20
executed, cancelled by the user, or when they expire. All pending orders wi=
ll=20
expire no later than 12 hours after being placed.

Pending Price Limit Orders will appear in a new window below the Quotes=20
screen in the website.

Product tabs: excelrOnline users can use enhanced filtering capabilities to=
=20
create separate page tabs for the products that interest them.  Users can=
=20
instantly access each page tab with a click of their mouse. Sort Ordering c=
an=20
be changed by clicking on a column heading, with multiple sorts possible by=
=20
holding down the shift key while clicking.

Floating windows: Users have the ability to create multiple windows with=20
different products by right-clicking on the products in the main quotes=20
screen.

Market news: Website users can now access the latest headlines, sports and=
=20
industry news from Reuters. Furthermore, the information categories can be=
=20
customized according to personal interests. To customize a particular=20
category, users need to click the Edit button in the category heading.

All information categories can be collapsed to save space. To expand or=20
collapse a category, users need to click the arrow to the left of the=20
category heading.

Stock quotes: excelrOnline now offers stock quotes (20 min. delay) from majo=
r=20
exchanges around the world.

Weather insights: Customers can now access weather maps and temperature dat=
a=20
for specific cities and regions.  Weather forecasts, up to six days ahead,=
=20
and temperature differentials from periodic averages are now available.

Industry publications: Website users can read a wide range of=20
industry-specific publications including Argus European Natural Gas, Argus=
=20
European Electricity, the news from NGI=01,s Daily Gas Price Index, Bandwid=
th=20
Desk, Coal Daily and more.

4. New Stack Manager Features

The Stack Manager has been updated to facilitate Price Limit Orders. You wi=
ll=20
notice that there is a new button at the top of the Stack Manager, which wi=
ll=20
open a window showing a summary of the best Price Limit Order bids and offe=
rs=20
against your managed products. You can click the ""+"" sign to the left of a=
=20
summary to show a list of all the Price Limit Orders which have been placed=
=20
against that product.

Under normal circumstances, the price shown on the website will be the same=
=20
as the price on your Stack Manager. However, the system will not allow you =
to=20
show a price which is better than an existing Price Limit Order. Instead, t=
he=20
system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing Price=
=20
Limit Order while it is being filled. Once the appropriate Price Limit Orde=
rs=20
are filled, then the website will again show your Stack Manager prices.

It is important that you complete the =01&Maximum Volume=018 field in the P=
roduct=20
Properties window and that you select ""Allow Price Limit Orders"". Also, mak=
e=20
sure that the price tick window in the Stack Manager=01,s =01&Product Prope=
rties=018=20
field is appropriate for the product. If you do not do this, your customers=
=20
will not be able to use Price Limit Orders for your products.


5. Your Participation
Please log in to http://prod.excelronline.com (no www.) on Wednesday. To=20
ensure excelrOnline Version 2.0 is a success, it is important that you have =

 Per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a Weather 
Trading and Valuation engine.  I have discussed the high level requirements 
with Joseph Koothrappaly and have identified an IT lead to manage the 
project. As discussed, the project will have the same project formula as the 
""Thunderball"" project with 3-6 month deliverables. Also, the need to have 
co-operative development between Houston and London will be established for 
Global roll out of the Weather system. The main focus will be a intranet 
trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine. The plan calls 
for Phase I roll out for January 1, 2001.   Next steps will need to be 
discuss as soon as possible.  Topics that need to be addressed are definition 
of Phase I, joint development between Houston and London, and duel 
development between Steve Stock's valuation team and my trading team. Keep in 
mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments, one person 
will manage the effort across teams.

Subject: social security

Hi Mary,
One other thing I wanted to mention to you today, it looks like someone is 
trying to use my social security number.  Like Mary Gosnell, I've been 
alerted by a financial institution on an attempt made.  Coincidently, the 
application says I work for the Herman Hospital which is the same for Mary G, 
so it looks like there is an excelr element connecting the two of cases 
together.  I've called the director of security and excelr's in-house police 
officer (who works from the excelr building M/W/F).  Security is looking into 
churn requests and the implementation of the new SAP system to see if there's 
a leak.

Joel had also overheard someone discussing this same subject in the elevator 
a few weeks past, so it doesn't look like it's isolated to Global Data 
Management.

Fortunately for me, nothing has come from the attempts - given I'm new to the 
country and have no established credit rating....I have taken the appropriate 
action so I don't think this will be too big of an issue.

Thanks,
Avril

Subject: We Need You


Some of you were contacted earlier this year by Cliff Baxter, excelr's 
representative on the Junior Achievement Board of Directors, regarding 
participation in excelr's Junior Achievement program.  Since so many changes 
have occurred within ENA since that time, we are renewing our request and 
broadening it to reach more departments.

One of the programs that we wish to support through Junior Achievement is Job 
Shadowing.  This program's objectives are to demonstrate why a sound 
education, interpersonal skills, and a strong work ethic are needed to 
succeed in the work place.  A successful Job Shadowing program requires your 
department's commitment and participation.

The Job Shadowing program consists of the following:

 9:00 - 10:30 AM  Welcome, Company Overview, Video, and Tour 
 10:30 - 12:00 N  Job Shadow Experience with excelr Employees and/or 
Departments
 12:00 - 1:00 PM  Lunch for Students with Mentors and Closing Comments

excelr has agreed to accept 16 high school juniors and seniors on the second 
Wednesday of each month from October 2000 through April 2001.  We need your 
assistance in hosting students within your department during the 10:30 AM - 
12:00 Noon period.   Students may be either paired up one-on-one with 
employees or may remain in groups of 2-4.  Employees participating in Job 
Shadowing will also be invited to join their students for a quick lunch and 
closing comments.  If enough departments participate, it is possible that 
each department may only be needed on a quarterly basis.

Although we have identified two individuals to provide the company overview 
and tour, we are also accepting additional volunteers in this area.  Please 
advise if anyone in your department is interested in assisting.

Please provide the following information to Nicki Daw or Susan Skarness by 
August 30, 2000.

 Department Name:

 Job Shadowing Contact Name:

 Number of Students:

 Individual to Assist With Tours:

We appreciate your consideration and participation in promoting Junior 
Achievement and excelr.

Subject: Bridge Problems

Over the last 8-10 business days, we have had a some issues on the bridges. I 
want to educate you a little bit on what can cause 
""bridge problems"".

First, what I want to explain is their is ONE GUI bridge application for 
users (backoffice users) to monitor the bridge but there are MULTIPLE
systems that excelrOnline transactions can be pointed to downstream. This is 
important to understand because if you do not know this ,
it may seem like we are having the same problem over & over; ie ""the bridge 
is having problems"". But in actuality, it is DIFFERENT 
problems. Still not good - but at least it cannot be isolated to ONE 
problem.   

Also, due to multiple systems (Sitara, Enpower, GasDesk, Tagg/ERMS, 
Powerdesk) are listening for messages from one excelrOnline, 
a ""bridge"" problem could be one of many issues. Some of which are:

 The server for excelrOnline  messenger goes down (doesn't send message to 
bridge to process)
 The excelr network goes down (cannot send message thru bridge)
 The NFS server (excelr main server) goes down
 Sitara server goes down
 Enpower server goes down 
 Tagg/ERMS server goes down
 Deal worker in ANY system gets ""hung up""
 Huge volume slows down processing time for one or more downstream systems
 Scheduled outage for maintenance on server on weekend was not re-started on 
Sunday 

and the list goes on.....................................

FYI In the past week & 1/2, the following actions happened, which caused 
""bridge"" problems. 

 Scheduled outage for maintenance on TAGG/erms server on weekend was not 
re-started on Sunday (not smart)
 The NFS server (excelr main server) goes down (affected Sitara & Tagg/ERMS)
 Deal worker in Sitara system got ""hung up"" and servers had to be bounced
 Member of excelrOnline Dev Team changed data for specific tokenised periods 
during trading hours instead of end of day
  (This failed deals in bridge for Sitara & Tagg/ERMS)

One thing to remember is you are getting calls from traders & back office. 
Traders are calling because they cannot see deals in their
position manager application of their system. If they are gas traders, if 
could be Sitara or Tagg system. If they are a power trader
calling, they cannot see it in Enpower. ecetera, ecetera

If a back office person calls, they are watching the monitor GUI and they can 
see deals queing/backing up and know there is a problem. 

We are working to resolve some of these issues, particularily, 
multi-processing tools, as we know the # of transactions will only increase.
Please feel free to email me if you have any questions. I hope this was 
helpful.

See below for explanation of problem on Wednesday.

Subject: Sitara Production Problem


I am forwarding a message that explains the Sitara Production problems from 
this morning. Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Karie (36759)




At  9:50am this morning a DealWorker process in the Sitara system became 
unresponsive. 
At  10:00 am it was determined that the EOLBridge in sitara was not 
processing new deal requests
and diagnostics lead to an indication that the dealworker was not functioning 
properly.
At 10:14, am the Dealworker was forced down and a new one restarted.
At 10:21 am , the EOLBridge began processing deals.

The cause of the is difficult to determine, but indicators point to an error 
in the CORBA product we are using, 
most likely due to scalability issues of that product and of Sitara. This is 
an issue that is actively being addressed.

25323,beck-s/all_documents/1483.,<27209753.1075855780605.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I just wanted to make sure you were aware of one thing in case it comes up on 
Friday (or you can bring it up if you would like...).  The only real system 
issues we have (outside of excelrOnline IT resources!) are the bridge 
resources.  Currenlty, EOL deals bridge to TAGG, Sitara, and Enpower.  We 
have had some issues in the past trying to get bridge issues corrected, and 
nail down reasons for bridge failures (among other things).  The problem has 
arisen due to the fact that each bridge really only has one person that is 
fully capable of correcting problems, and until last week, these three 
individuals really did not have anyone defining the bridge as part of their 
day to day responsibilities.  When Tom Moore left early this year, these guys 
were left in limbo.  Luckily, they were seldom out, and all three of them 
were very good at getting back to us for the most part.  

Now for the good news - Jennifer and I had a meeting with Richard Burchfield 
last week - the bridges are now part of his world.  This was initiated by a 
memo Jennifer copied Beth on regarding bridge failures.  I will forward this 
to you as well.  Richard understands the importance of the bridge and ensured 
us that he will add some structure to this group.  It is especially critical 
when the Sitara bridge goes down late morning, and we are doing next day 
physical deals on excelrOnline.  I have a good working relationship with him 
(from the old Synergi days), so I think this will be great for us.  I 
provided him copies of the IT Compliance flow charts related to the bridges 
so that he could gain an understanding of how they work.   Since this 
meeting, Jennifer has contacted additional resources that Richard referred us 
to, and they have been very responsive (one of the guys volunteered his pager 
and told us to call him any time regarding any bridge...).  So, that said, 
hopefully our only ""issue"" is correcting itself due to Jennifer's 
perseverance!

Apart from that, we do have an item on our wish list (excelrOnline IT) to 
simplify the messages that are sent across the bridges to hopefully speed up 
processing time.  Right now the bridges have to do a lot of thinking to 
determine how to book certain deals - we want to eliminate that thinking by 
adding a deal type identifier on the deal which will automatically tell the 
bridge what to do.  I can give you more details on this if you'd like, but 
this is short and sweet explanation...

Subject: Trade Warehouse Mtg - Purpose

Hi Nicki,
Thanks for setting up the meeting next Wednesday (9/20) at 2:30 with M.=20
Frevert, D. Delainey, J. Shankman, and J. Lavorato.  Here is a brief overvi=
ew=20
of the meeting objective:

Purpose
To gain support and approval for a data warehouse vision containing=20
consolidated trade information with centralized access.

Background
The definition of a data warehouse is a place to consolidate information=20
originating from multiple transaction processing systems and platforms into=
 a=20
common database repository.  The idea of an excelr =01&Trade Warehouse=018=
=20
originated from members of the London office and has been expanded to inclu=
de=20
the Houston systems.  The need for a Trade Warehouse stems from the=20
requirement of multiple departments needing to access consolidated deal=20
information for analytical reporting and down-stream processing.   Currentl=
y,=20
deal information is held in separate trading systems both within product=20
process flows from mid to back office, and across product lines. The=20
information is also stored across multiple system platforms and is not easi=
ly=20
accessible or consistently presented across the various trading products=20
within excelr. Given this current architecture, it is very difficult and=20
costly to access timely, quality-assured, and consolidated cross-product de=
al=20
information for analytical reporting and down-stream processing.

Proposal
Houston will use the warehouse as the data source for EnTelligence and=20
numerous analytical reporting application systems.  These analytical=20
reporting application systems can include, but are not limited to,=20
Operational Pricing Module (OPM), excelrOnline, and Daily Position Report=20
(DPR).  Once the warehouse is in place, it may be used as the source for=20
additional downstream systems as well as Investor Relations reporting.

Proposed list - of all potential candidates

Myself
James New - and his lead risk managers
Mike Wellings - UK Power
Coralie Evans - Continental Power
Robert Yeo - UK and Continental Gas
Paul D'Arcy - Structured Products
David Wall - Credit
Tim Poullain-Patterson - Metals Integration
Andrew Cornfield - Metals Risk Manager
Kevin Rhodes - Metals Controller ( there are in fact two controllers at 
present Kevin for Financial Trading and Howard Carter for Merchanting )

I would leave Ralph Jaeger of Frankfurt out of the offsite if places are 
restricted  - He is covered by the mainstream Accounting conferences, but I 
would have Jan Erland, and Heidi and Tiong Hock from Singapore.

I am not sure Fernley would want to be there - but I can ask.

On others  - Simon Thurbin of liquids in london should be in Houston and 
would be a good choice for inclusion. Brent may want his two London 
controllers of Cindy Horn and Kenny Nicoll to also come

Would you invite Kristen to come with( in place of Barry? ).

A long list ( and we may want to cut back ) but all these individuals carry 
the burden of operational risk assessment and management - standardising that 
process would be an achievement indeed.

presentations - we had thought about engaging RAC, IT etc

Nevertheless, I am sorry if I did not make myself clear when we talked about 
this last Tuesday: I am not advocating penalizing business units because of 
their 1week ROVARs or Sharpes.  I would certainly not set traders' bonuses 
based on these numbers (nor do I think anyone at excelr would consider doing 
that). 

excelr focuses on long term profit and risk.  However, the long term is made 
up of many short terms, and catastrophes can occur if a company's management 
does not pay close attention to the latter.  Indeed, excelr management is very 
interested in short term profitability (they want to be notified of very 
large 1 and 5 day losses) and short term risk (we report daily VaR limit 
violations).  In this spirit, I am simply offering 1 and 4 week ROVARs and 
Sharpes as something interesting and useful that we can now produce from the 
DPR database, and I will let upper management use or ignore them as they see 
fit.

Eugenio

Subject: Risk Metrics

Eugenio,
        In regard to your recent e-mail concerning RoVar, Sharpe and other 
risk metrics, and our meeting on Tuesday, it is imperative to understand that

(1) While P&L is a number one can aggregate on a daily basis, VaR numbers on 
1-week or 4-week basis, and consequently RoVaR numbers, are not meaningful 
operationally (ie, trading activity and senior management decision-making) 
and statistically.  RoVaR and Sharpe were designed to measure business unit 
performance over extended time periods (preferably a year).  Specifically, 
you cannot penalize, or make  reasonable business decisions about  a  unit , 
because of their 1-week RoVar or Sharpe.

(2) Significant trading activity at ENE is composed of long-term strategic 
trades (seasonal plays with durations of over 6 months, perhaps), wherein 
desk heads and  senior management have an intuitive feeling for their RoVaR 
(OVER 6 MONTHS).   A 1-week or  4-week ""interim"" number  in this case is not 
useful.   Traders might purposefully want to make  a certain 1-week or 4-week 
RoVaR LOW in their trading activity if they believe their 6-month number can 
be HIGH.  In such a case, a 1-week number might send dangerous messages to 
senior management.


(3) Conceptually,  P&L and VaR, in isolation, are numbers which are sound and 
rigourously calculated.  The Ratio, however,  one has to be careful about.  
The numerator (cumulative P&L over a certain period) can be aggregated by 
simple arithmetic summation, no problems.  However, the denominator (average 
daily VaR over a certain period) relies on the underlying assumption that 
each point in your time series is independent and correlationless.  To get a 
sufficient statistic for the denominator, one would have to take a large 
sample in your series (6 months or more), for a DAILY AVERAGE VaR number to 
be meaningful, statistically.

(4) The RAC group has instituted similar metrics which have been in usage  
for over two years.  The numbers are shown to the B.O.D with the express 
intent of comaring business unit performance on a 6-month or yearly tenor.  
Please contact Matthew Adams (RAC) or myself  to make sure that we are on the 
same footing regarding the actual calculation of such metrics.  Also, in the 
future, just to be consistent and on-the-same-page, please contact me or Mr. 
Adams if any risk-related numbers are to be showcased in a public forum.

(5) Finally, as you can probably corroborate, senior management might  not 
be  fully versed on the nuances of VaR, let alone 1-week VaR ratios.  
Therefore, one has to be wary of the misuse of ratios and risk metrics.

I liked your presentation of your database on Tuesday.  I think it is a nice 
step in aggregating and dissecting  P&L from disparate sources.

Best Regards
Naveen

software that streamlines the settlements process.  More information about 
their products can be found at http://www.cavio.com/.  They would like to 
visit excelr and discuss the potential of partnering with us.  Essentially 
they would charge our customers a fee for the process of clearing or settling 
their transactions and share a portion of the revenue with excelr.  The 
benefit to our customers is a reduced cost for letters of credit.  

Bottom line is that they would like to meet with us and see if their is any 
interest in trying to put something together.  Please let me know if you are 
interested in being a part of the meeting and I will coordinate setting it 
up.  Thanks!  -  Tommy

Dear Tommy, 
Further to my phone message to you on Wednesday morning, I have great news. 
It appears the last points have been ironed out and that CheMatch will be 
going forward with the Cavio Solution.  Our CEO and VP of Sales will be 
attending a meeting with CheMatch in Houston in mid to late January.  As 
well, interest has been shown from the Natural Gas Exchange (www.ngx.com) and 
Automated Power Exchange (www.apx.com).  From our discussions, it has become 
apparent that these two sites currently deal with excelr at some level and 
both agree that the Cavio Solution could effect a positive change in the lag 
time currently seen for billing cycles (up to 55 days) as well as providing 
other benefits.  I feel that with excelr and CheMatch setting a new standard 
with Cavio, many of your current clients will be eager to join, and your 
competition will be left behind.
Based on the fact that you had expressed interest in Cavio and Beta testing 
the Cavio Solution for trades currently happening between Cheats and excelr,  
I think that it may be an ideal time to plan a meeting with your team in 
conjunction with our meeting with CheMatch.  
Please advise as soon as possible. 
Thanks.

The following is the current status of our outstanding items:

Observation: RED:  Foreign currency risks are managed by the respective 
trader within each of the trading portfolios:

Status:  Revise target date to November 30, 2000.  The new associate in 
charge of currency starts September 15th.  Due to the complex nature of the 
problem, she will require time to gain an understanding of the currency risks 
in each of the books, and to determine the most effective process to manage 
the risks within the various trading portfolios.

Observation:  YELLOW - Due to the anticipated deregulation of the Canadian 
power market effective 2001, transaction volume is expected to increase thus 
increasing the need to capture transactions in an automated system 
environment (Enpower).

Status:  We are currently entering our transactions in the test environment.  
We expect to have Enpower in production for Calgary by September 30th.

Observation:  YELLOW - Term transactions executed via EOL do not 
automatically bridge into the capture systems thus increasing the amount of 
transactions manually captured.

Status:  Houston is currently testing the new functionality.  This is 
expected to be in production by October 6th.

If you have any questions or require additional information, please let me 
know.

Sorry, I should not have sent you London

Jeff Skilling and Sally met yesterday to discuss the status of the doorstep 
project, findings, etc.  As a result, Sally has asked me to put together a 
summary of findings to be discussed with the business heads, as Jeff is 
planning to contact them about the doorstep findings.

I have prepared a schedule from the doorstep database, ranked findings, and 
indicated which common findings were found in each office.

Please review this sheet on Calgary against the findings as you are aware, 
and give me your feedback (changes, updates, etc).  I need this as soon as 
possible, as Sally would like to alert the business heads as early as 
possible.

I am interofficing you the doorstep findings and ratings as I currently have

Changes to the manual list for North America need to be authorized by Wes and

Mary, Larry and Wes,
We just received a faxed copy of the Manual Wire and Same Day Payment memo 
which was sent by Betty Tauzier on 8/28/00.
Rate & Currency trades fx which is settled the following day and requires 
next day payments for FX.  Currently we are severely hampered because our 
infomation is required into Unify by 2:30 for an Accounts Payable run at 4:00 
for next day payments.  We are still trading after these cut-offs and tying 
out the day's activity with Trading.  Therefore, we currently have to rely on 
manual wires to make payments to our counterparties on the value date.  

We need to get timeframes which mirror our business requirements.  I would 
like to get the Accounts Payable run for our companies, 842 and 967, moved to 
after 5:00 pm.  Information is not due to the bank until next day. 8:00 am 
London time.

Please let Laurel and me know what changes can be done to our processing 
flows.
Thanks. Sheila

Changes to the manual list for North America need to be authorized by Wes and 
Sally.  We are specifically limiting the number of signers.

I think that what we need to do is immediately address the issues that are 
causing your wires to miss the standard process.  We did not have the issue 
prior to SAP.

Please outline your processing requirements and we can work together with AP 
and SAP to fix the underlying issue.  
Thanks for the help.

We just received a faxed copy of the Manual Wire and Same Day Payment memo 
which was sent by Betty Tauzier on 8/28/00.
Rate & Currency trades fx which is settled the following day and requires 
next day payments for FX.  Currently we are severely hampered because our 
infomation is required into Unify by 2:30 for an Accounts Payable run at 4:00 
for next day payments.  We are still trading after these cut-offs and tying 
out the day's activity with Trading.  Therefore, we currently have to rely on 
manual wires to make payments to our counterparties on the value date.  

We need to get timeframes which mirror our business requirements.  I would 
like to get the Accounts Payable run for our companies, 842 and 967, moved to 
after 5:00 pm.  Information is not due to the bank until next day. 8:00 am 
London time.

Please let Laurel and me know what changes can be done to our processing 
flows.

software that streamlines the settlements process.  More information about 
their products can be found at http://www.cavio.com/.  They would like to 
visit excelr and discuss the potential of partnering with us.  Essentially 
they would charge our customers a fee for the process of clearing or settling 
their transactions and share a portion of the revenue with excelr.  The 
benefit to our customers is a reduced cost for letters of credit.  

Bottom line is that they would like to meet with us and see if their is any 
interest in trying to put something together.  Please let me know if you are 
interested in being a part of the meeting and I will coordinate setting it 
up.  Thanks!  -  Tommy

Dear Tommy, 
Further to my phone message to you on Wednesday morning, I have great news. 
It appears the last points have been ironed out and that CheMatch will be 
going forward with the Cavio Solution.  Our CEO and VP of Sales will be 
attending a meeting with CheMatch in Houston in mid to late January.  As 
well, interest has been shown from the Natural Gas Exchange (www.ngx.com) and 
Automated Power Exchange (www.apx.com).  From our discussions, it has become 
apparent that these two sites currently deal with excelr at some level and 
both agree that the Cavio Solution could effect a positive change in the lag 
time currently seen for billing cycles (up to 55 days) as well as providing 
other benefits.  I feel that with excelr and CheMatch setting a new standard 
with Cavio, many of your current clients will be eager to join, and your 
competition will be left behind.
Based on the fact that you had expressed interest in Cavio and Beta testing 
the Cavio Solution for trades currently happening between Cheats and excelr,  
I think that it may be an ideal time to plan a meeting with your team in 
conjunction with our meeting with CheMatch.  
Please advise as soon as possible. 
Thanks.

Observation: RED:  Foreign currency risks are managed by the respective 
trader within each of the trading portfolios:

Status:  Revise target date to November 30, 2000.  The new associate in 
charge of currency starts September 15th.  Due to the complex nature of the 
problem, she will require time to gain an understanding of the currency risks 
in each of the books, and to determine the most effective process to manage 
the risks within the various trading portfolios.

Observation:  YELLOW - Due to the anticipated deregulation of the Canadian 
power market effective 2001, transaction volume is expected to increase thus 
increasing the need to capture transactions in an automated system 
environment (Enpower).

Status:  We are currently entering our transactions in the test environment.  
We expect to have Enpower in production for Calgary by September 30th.

Observation:  YELLOW - Term transactions executed via EOL do not 
automatically bridge into the capture systems thus increasing the amount of

  While I think it makes sense for this type of information to be available, 
that it should be done by Operations, and that Eugenio has the skills and 
knowledge to articulate it well, I have some concerns.   First and foremost, 
the process of creating a standard risk metric belongs to RAC, I believe.  To 
me this is no different than VAR, or the Capital Pricing methodololgy, or the 
RAROC process.   This has been published without even a review from our 
group, which I think is inappropriate for two reasons: 1) we might disagree 
and, as stated above, I think we have the final say, and 2) we can't quality 
control it and all the reciepients think that I have.  Second, this has been 
developed in isolation when in fact we have been doing similar things for the 
past 2 years. We report these to the Board and have published to the Desk 
heads on a monthly basis returns by trader.  Clearly, there could have been 
some benefit in each direction if we were told that this was a goal of this 
group, particularly when we fundamentally agree that this group should be 
doing these things.  Thirdly, it is a little irritating when someone sets up 
a process in isolation for what may appear to be ""show-time"" when my group is 
spending hours and hours analyzing the output of existing process because the 
data integrity is so bad (double mapping of portfolios, books not 
officialized......) - we have at least attempted to take both parts of the 
equation, Eugenio has chosen to focus on the cool part.  Now I would be a 
little less concerned if on almost every day, Eugenio wasn't in my morning 
meeting contributing virtually nothing, i.e., this doesn't appear to be 
oversight on his part.

I would prefer to not make a big deal out of this, but rather take it as an 
opportunity to clarify and shift some responsibilities.  In the big scheme of 
things it is a move in the right direction.

Penny for your thoughts

Subject: Four New Graphs

We have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the 
DPR: 

Return on VaR (ROVAR)
Curve Shift P&L (Delta - Gamma) Sharpe Ratio
Risk - Return (Large)
Risk - Return (Small)

All of these graphs deal with the concept of risk-adjusted return.  The 
markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics.  Furthermore, 
excelr's appetite for risk also differs in each market.  As a result, it is 
difficult to compare returns in absolute terms.  Therefore, the approach of 
these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk, in effect restating 
return numbers into a standard base (how many dollars we earn for every 
dollar we put at risk).


 For each business unit or commodity group, the ROVAR graph shows an average 
of daily total P&L divided by an average of daily VaR.  Higher ROVARs 
indicate better performance (relative to other business units).  For each 
business unit or commodity group there are two bars: the dark blue on the 
left shows ROVAR on a 4 week (20 business day) rolling basis, and the light 
blue on the right shows ROVAR on a 1 week (5 business day) rolling basis.  
Because of the shorter term, the 1 week ROVAR is more sensitive: it can be 
quite high or low, and it changes frequently.


The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept; it shows an average of 
daily curve shift P&L (both delta and gamma) divided by its standard 
deviation. This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non-trading P&L (like new 
deals, reserves, and so forth).  Furthermore, whereas VaR is a forward 
looking statistic (the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given 
probability), standard deviation is backward looking (the actual volatility 
of our returns over the period). This graph also has two bars for every 
business unit or commodity group: a dark brown on the left showing the Sharpe 
ratio on a 4 week rolling basis, and a light brown on the right showing the 
ratio on a 1 week basis.

The Curve Shift P&L Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other 
well.  They measure different things, but if our P&L is composed mostly of 
curve shift, and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift volatility, the two 
statistics should be very close.


Sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the P&L relative 
to the risk.  We therefore put together the Risk - Return graphs.  On the 
vertical axis, they show 4 week rolling average P&L.  On the horizontal, they 
show 4 week rolling average VaR.  The various business units are plotted as 
points on the graphs.  These graphs are closely related to the 4-week ROVARs, 
in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is 
the business unit's ROVAR (average P&L / average VaR).  Another way of 
looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin 
(0,0) with the plotted point of a business unit is its ROVAR.  Books with 
small risks and returns (< $2 million) are plotted on the ""Small"" graph, and 
the rest, on the ""Large"".

These graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize and 
capture the information that is reported in the DPR.  Most, but not all of 
the information in the DPR currently flows from the database.  As a result, 
we do not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit.  As we 
continue to set up exports into the database, we will fill in the missing 
numbers.

We will e-mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the 
intra-net.  Please remember to launch the file in Excel, instead of using the 
Lotus Notes viewer.  The VaR Limit Usage graphs that we created last week are 
already on the web.  We hope that you find all of these useful.

Mike,
I don't understand the question.  London informatiion was not complete in the

management information they were forced to make decisions with.  As I said, I 
am not telling on anyone or accusing anyone of anything but I can virtually

Well,
today (or rather yesterday) it happened.  We have been pushing our limits 
hard and the makets here have been very volatile.  We had a large increase in 
North American Natural Gas VAR due to the breaking apart the Rockies/SoCal 
basis correlation.  This am, we were attempting to get firm numbers on the 
effect on our corporate limits so that we could provide 
Jeff/Delainey/Lavorato/Buy/.... the information to make decisions whether or 
not to reduce positions.  The number was not firm until 11 am houston time.  
My understanding is that the Houston numbers were all in before 8 am and that 
we were waiting for London.  While I am sure that there are issues all around 
and I do not think that anyone Senior in Houston is even aware, let alone 
prepared to blame, I fear that this will not always be the case.  I think 
something needs to be changed in our process so that this can be avoided in 
the future.   

Please do not take this as a nasty-gram.  No one is cc'd or bcc'd.  I just 
think that it will be deemed unacceptable.
Any thoughts/comments?

*  North American Gas has now decreased its overall average daily EOL deal 
count by about 500 trades a day since November.  There are now approximately 
2,633 trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being traded on EOL.

*  The Financial Desk in North American Gas has increased its average daily 
EOL deal count by about 45% since October, from 494 to 714 deals per day in 
November.  In December, the average daily EOL deal count was down 8%, from 
714 to 658 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily EOL volume has 
decreased steadily in December.

*  ECC Canada West Gas has decreased its average daily EOL deal count by 
about 46% since November, from 213 to 113 deals per day.  In addition, the 
average daily EOL volume has decreased about 40% since November.  However, 
the average daily Non-EOL deal count has only decreased by about 10% since 
November, from 88 to 79 deals per day.

*  US West Power has decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 71% 
since November, from 187 to 54 deals per day.  However, the average daily 
Non-EOL Deal Count has decreased by only about 21% since November, from 171 
to 136 deals per day.  The average daily combined EOL and Non-EOL volume has 
remained steady.

*  US East Power has decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 24% 
since November, from 167 to 127 deals per day.  However, the average daily 
Non-EOL Deal Count has actually increased by about 3% since November, from 
230 to 237 deals per day.  The average daily combined EOL and Non-EOL volume 
has increased by about 20% total.  These recent trends in Power may indicate 
a shift in on-line power transactions from EOL to our competitors.

*  LPG's has steadily increased its total monthly EOL deal count from 281 in 
September, 398 in October, to 444 in November.  In December,  LPG's appear to 
have levelled off with 449 deals completed in December.  The total monthly 
EOL volumes have increased similarly as well.

*  Coal trades have decreased significantly from the levels seen in October.  
The total monthly EOL deal count for November was only about 23% of the total 
in October.  The total monthly EOL deal count for December was only about 83% 
of the total in November.

*  excelr Metals trades done via EOL has risen by approximately 47% since 
November, from a daily average of 242 to a daily average of 357 for December.

DPR: 

Return on VaR (ROVAR)
Curve Shift P&L (Delta - Gamma) Sharpe Ratio
Risk - Return (Large)
Risk - Return (Small)

All of these graphs deal with the concept of risk-adjusted return.  The 
markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics.  Furthermore, 
excelr's appetite for risk also differs in each market.  As a result, it is 
difficult to compare returns in absolute terms.  Therefore, the approach of 
these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk, in effect restating 
return numbers into a standard base (how many dollars we earn for every 
dollar we put at risk).


 For each business unit or commodity group, the ROVAR graph shows an average 
of daily total P&L divided by an average of daily VaR.  Higher ROVARs 
indicate better performance (relative to other business units).  For each 
business unit or commodity group there are two bars: the dark blue on the 
left shows ROVAR on a 4 week (20 business day) rolling basis, and the light 
blue on the right shows ROVAR on a 1 week (5 business day) rolling basis.  
Because of the shorter term, the 1 week ROVAR is more sensitive: it can be 
quite high or low, and it changes frequently.


The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept; it shows an average of 
daily curve shift P&L (both delta and gamma) divided by its standard 
deviation. This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non-trading P&L (like new 
deals, reserves, and so forth).  Furthermore, whereas VaR is a forward 
looking statistic (the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given 
probability), standard deviation is backward looking (the actual volatility 
of our returns over the period). This graph also has two bars for every

Subject: SAP Initiative

Sally - it was great seeing you last week at the ASE in Dallas.  I'm sorry we 
didn't have the opportunity to work together in any of the groups.  As you 
may know,  I have just completed the SAP HR Implementation Project and my 
current role, working for Andrea Yowman, is to maximize our investment in SAP 
HR.
  
To that end, next Thursday, 9/14, two people from SAP will be here to 
interview non-HR managers on a new project as described below.  You have been 
identified as an excellent resource to participate in this effort, and I 
would appreciate it if you would be able to spend 1/2 hour with this team and 
have your admin spend another hour with them as well -- times noted below.

Please let me know if you are available and willing to participate in this 
initiative.  It is the beginning of our ongoing relationship with SAP to 
develop what excelr needs, and your input is considered invaluable to this 
process.  Please respond with your availability at the times noted below and 
I will prepare a final agenda and itinerary early next week.

Thanks for your consideration to participate in this effort.  If you have any 
questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to call me at 
3-0363.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Proposed agenda
We would like to interview managers and their administrators.

 9:30 - 10:00 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#1
10:00 - 11:00 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#1
  
 1:00 -  1:30 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#2
 1:30 -  2:30 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#2

 2:30 -  3:00 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#3
 3:00 -  4:00 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#3

What is this project?
SAP is developing new software for managers that will be integrated with the
Workplace. It will be flexible and powerful enough to support managers at
all levels and in all industries. This project is supported directly by the
HR Desktop Manager group and has been endorsed by top managers throughout
SAP in the U.S. and Germany.

SAP has learned that to produce great software products we have to get close
to our end users. To do that, we need your help. Our goal is to visit eight
SAP customers in the U.S. excelr is one of the eight companies we would like
to visit.

Who do we want to interview and observe?
In a one-day visit, we want to observe and interview three types of
managers.
* High-level manager, involved in strategic planning, overall budget
responsibilities, strategic direction. The high-level manager tends to
delegate most of his daily and weekly activities to subordinates.
* Operational manager, involved in running a large department or small
subsidiary. Often reports to the high-level manager. Has budget and
personnel responsibility for the department or subsidiary. May also have
product-planning responsibilities.
* Group manager, primarily focused on a business activity such as
accounts payable manager, line manager, or production planner; but also
involved in managing a small group. Often has hands-on personnel and
lower-level budget responsibilities. Concerned with the day-to-day business.

What can you expect during a site visit?
We have found that the most efficient way to organize our interviews is to
meet with a contact person in your company (that would be me) who will then 
escort us to our
interviews. This allows our team to introduce themselves and explain their
objectives.  Our interviews are conducted at the managers' workstations
where our team will spend about 1/2 hour observing the manager in his/her
daily work and asking questions.  We will then spend the next hour with 
his/her
administrative assistant.

Interviewees do not have to prepare anything. We prefer to interview people
where they work because often the work environment can give us a lot of
insights about what managers need from a software product. We ask people to
be completely honest and forthcoming with us. We treat all sensitive
information with utmost confidentiality.

There will be two teams from SAP meeting with a total of 6 managers and 
administrative assistants from 
various areas in various business units.

Subject: We Need You


Some of you were contacted earlier this year by Cliff Baxter, excelr's 
representative on the Junior Achievement Board of Directors, regarding 
participation in excelr's Junior Achievement program.  Since so many changes 
have occurred within ENA since that time, we are renewing our request and 
broadening it to reach more departments.

One of the programs that we wish to support through Junior Achievement is Job 
Shadowing.  This program's objectives are to demonstrate why a sound 
education, interpersonal skills, and a strong work ethic are needed to 
succeed in the work place.  A successful Job Shadowing program requires your 
department's commitment and participation.

The Job Shadowing program consists of the following:

 9:00 - 10:30 AM  Welcome, Company Overview, Video, and Tour 
 10:30 - 12:00 N  Job Shadow Experience with excelr Employees and/or 
Departments
 12:00 - 1:00 PM  Lunch for Students with Mentors and Closing Comments

excelr has agreed to accept 16 high school juniors and seniors on the second 
Wednesday of each month from October 2000 through April 2001.  We need your 
assistance in hosting students within your department during the 10:30 AM - 
12:00 Noon period.   Students may be either paired up one-on-one with 
employees or may remain in groups of 2-4.  Employees participating in Job 
Shadowing will also be invited to join their students for a quick lunch and 
closing comments.  If enough departments participate, it is possible that 
each department may only be needed on a quarterly basis.

Although we have identified two individuals to provide the company overview 
and tour, we are also accepting additional volunteers in this area.  Please 
advise if anyone in your department is interested in assisting.

Please provide the following information to Nicki Daw or Susan Skarness by 
August 30, 2000.

things. We made progress.....but we also have issues to work. 


Summary On Improvements For This End Of Month Close

I would like to congratulate the users, the application team and the DBA team 
for a much improved end of month close for August gas. This would not have 
been possible without the significant commitment, focus and teamwork 
exhibited by all the folks involved in this effort. 

The most tangible measure of progress over the July close : 
We were able to keep all users in the system throughout the final week. No 
one was kicked off the system.
The gas accounting close process finished on time. Key users and IT folks 
didn't have to work significant overtime to finish the process. 

 Improvements arose from : 

Upgrading the Unify system to Sybase 12 with extra server memory. This 
reduced system 'locking and blocking' and made it possible to keep all users 
in the system throughout the week. Nightly settlements for gas invoicing also 
ran much faster. Many thanks to the DBAs - Jim Ogg and Kishroe Bharathi-- for 
many late nights and weekends. Many thanks also to the application team and 
the users for lots of testing before the production rollout.

Conducting a pre-planning session that identified new end of month techniques 
to improve efficiency. The users generated several new ideas including the 
idea to pre-process PMAs the night before running the current mass draft. 
This meeting provided several new approaches, a clear plan and cohesive 
communication throughout the end of month process. Many thanks to the all the 
users as well as Bob Superty, Bryce Baxter, Melissa Ratnala, Dave Nommensen 
and Chris Schomer for making this happen. Many of these ideas will now be 
part of a standard process. 

The performance monitoring and tuning team reacted quickly to address changes 
in system performance. Many thanks to Matt Pena and the rest of this team for 
keeping the system up and running as fast as possible during the day. 

Release of a new tuned version of the Accurals process that runs much faster. 


Issues, Challenges, Action Items

While we made progress this month, there are still several significant issues 
and opportunities for improvement. The following is a list of the things that 
'went bump in the night' and the action items we've identified. 

1. We experienced several Sybase 12.0 errors early in the week that impacted 
gas business. All of these problems are now fixed. This had the following 
business impacts: 
The bridgeback of deals to Sitara was delayed. These deals were bridged 
manually before the end of month valuation. We also fixed the code problem 
that generated th original problem.
Global Systems replication to Unify was down on Monday. This problem was 
fixed with a software patch from Sybase Monday evening. All affected deals 
were then uploaded. Nominations were completed for these deals on Monday 
through manual estimation by the schedulers. 
Communication between the DBA group and the application group was delayed on 
the Global Systems replication problem. This delayed our ability to notify 
users of the problem. Communication on problems will be be improved in the 
future. The default assumption will be to notify key application and 
infrastructure personnel as soon as any serious problem is identified. 

2.  We experienced a hardware issue with a bad server CPU at 3:00AM on 
Thursday.  As a result, database backups ran into the morning when the server 
came back up. This created slow system response and delayed logins for users 
until 10:00 AM. This problem is now fixed. 
 Action Item: Kishore will coordinate with Randy Matson from the 
infrastructure group to coordinate a stress test of all production server 
components. This will allow us to see if we can find any other marginal 
components.  This will be completed by September 18. 

3. All service PMAs for ENA and HPLC were not picked up by the Settlements 
process. HPLC PMAs were run manually by the users. For ENA, missing PMAs were 
immaterial and the users decided to close with these results. We have now 
found and fixed the error that caused this problem. 
 Action Item: Chris Schomer is having his team investigate this problem to 
see if this is just a Sybase 12.0 issue or whether this error could have 
impacted previous months. A determination should be available by September 
15. 

4. Enpower deal load did not load deals with referenced prices correctly. 
These deals have now been successfully loaded and are currently completed 
through the mass draft process for power. We have identified and fixed the 
software error that caused this problem. 

5. Power mass draft is now running very slow as compared to prior months. We 
are currently working to complete the Power mass draft process. It will be 
completed by the user deadline for close of business Wednesday Sept. 6. 
 Action Item: Chris Schomer's team is investigating why the Power mass draft 
is running so slow.  At present we do not have a definitive answer. We hope 
to develop a definitive answer and action plan by September 15. Our current 
hypothesis for why we have this problem includes : 
Data changes - we now have a much higher volume of hourly priced deals
Potential database index issues. We will re-build all power database indexes 
and re-compile the stored procedures
Sybase optimizer flakiness. We often see Sybase suddenly start to have 
processing problems for no apparent reason.  


Update On Future Tactical  And Strategic Improvements

We have several pending tactical Unify performance improvements that are in 
process. These include: 

1) Isolating Unify Gas on a server of it's own 
2) Delivery of a middle tier mass draft process to reduce locking and blocking
3) Upgrade of the middle tier mass draft process to allow for drafting at a 
deal level (rather than just a counter-party level)
4) Delivery of the nominations and balancing process on a middle tier 
architecture.

Ramesh Rao and his team have the strategic projects progressing on schedule.  
We are seeing significant performance gains in our testing of SQL Server over 
Sybase. We also have identified a couple of hardware vendors that could 
provide very large, scaleable computing environments for this type of Unify 
architecture. We plan to have all critical evaluation testing completed by 
the end of September as planned. We will present our recommendations along 
with a high-level strategic delivery plan by early October.

Subject: CASH FLOWS FROM EI-GNS-GAS-PRC

Infinity showed a $19 MM notional curve shift change in the EI-GNS-GAS-PRC 
commodity book for 9/1/00.  This change caused a (10,200) PV01 affect on the 
trader's sensitivity report.  After talking with Susan in EI, it was brought 
to our attention that the Bolivian curve was loaded incorrectly on Friday, 
due to a change in EI's curve upload process.   This change resulted in the 
Bolivian curve loading throughout 2012, when it actually goes out to 2019.  
The incomplete curve caused  infinity to get bad cash flows.  

As a result, we had to re-do PDH reports this morning.  Final reports were 
given to traders at 9:00 am.

This morning I spent some time with David Maxwell of the Merchant Asset

Merchant Asset Group to report to me.  Although I do not know all the 
methodologies used by the group, I am familiar with the valuation of assets 
and understand the underlying principals for most methods.  At Fleming I was 
involved, at a much smaller scale, in the reporting of similar portfolios and 
believe that I can be of assistance to the group in moving away from their

Subject: Re: excelr Japan Commercial Support Model  

Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office 
in Japan.  I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought 
processes.  I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations 
personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense.  
While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good 
option.  

I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.  After 
several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a 
practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no 
meetings.  That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your 
document on the list for more careful review on Friday.  I can send you a 
note then if there are any other comments that I have.  

I should have apologized  in the first paragraph for standing you up while 
you were here in Houston.  Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some 
concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my 
schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the 
calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he 
is under!).  I hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person 
sometime in the not too distant future.  

Mike Jordan and I have been working on a worldwide forum for business 
controllers for all commodities and offices.  I am working on securing a 
location in or around Houston, shooting for October 23,24 as potential 
dates.  More details to come on that in the next day or so.  I know that is a 
long way from Toyko, but if the dates work for you I hope that you can join 
us.

Sorry if there was any confusion in my email - it was not actually prompted

I'm really trying to get commitment from business sponsors (principally Mike

functionality.  If we don't get this, it may be difficult for us to maintain 
a common database across Houston and London, and IT will end up acting as a 
broker between different business areas when establishing priorities.  I 
doubt any of us want that.

Cheers

John

Subject: Re: Enlighten Common Timetable  

For Global Markets, we were not scheduled to get anything by the end of the 
year from Enlighten, Envoice or DTL.  But in order to establish what could 
potentially be delivered by July 2001, we were inquiring as to the data 
elements that were going to be stored as well as the functionality.  It would 
be hard to make committments to use an application, without really knowing 
what it does.  Clarification was what we were trying to get and will require, 
to do a true gap analysis so we can quantify the extent that these 
applications fit or do not fit our business.  

I received a functional spec for Envoice today and would like to get one for 
DTL and Enlighten to get a better understanding of the scope of these and 
possible enhancements that could be added on later.

I am sorry if my queries caused some ""ripples"".   I still would like some 
tangible information to start looking at regarding these applications.  
Please let me know what information you can supply us.   Thanks    Cindy

Subject: Enlighten Common Timetable

Dear all

There is currently some debate as to what is going to be delivered by 
Enlighten.  Some clarification and a question:

Clarification:
Enlighten (certainly in London) is actually a data hub, rather than an 
application.  In itself, it will not add business value.  However, the tools 
which sit on top of this system will add business value.  These tools are 
currently DTL, Envoice, Zebra.  However, I think we all anticipate more 
requirements being developed as this central data store becomes richer.

Question (for business sponsors):
We are trying hard to coordinate US and UK efforts.  However, this will be 
extremely difficult if our respective business timelines are not the same.  
Say - for example - Mike wants Enlighten to deliver volumetric reporting by 
then end of 2000 but Cindy instead wants a full DPR in the same timeline.  
Our data architects are going to struggle to coordinate and prioritise their 
work if we are working for two separate sets of masters.  So:

If we are really to reap the rewards of a UK/US implementation, a common 
timetable is extremely important.  Who are our primary UK and US business 
sponsors and can we ask them to agree a mutual timeline ?  I suspect if we 
are to try and make this a joint development, nothing will make delivery 
harder than having separate and sometimes mutually exclusive sets of 
requirements from our user communities.  

Comments/answers please...

Cheers

John

Subject: London Risk Reporting

Well,
today (or rather yesterday) it happened.  We have been pushing our limits 
hard and the makets here have been very volatile.  We had a large increase in 
North American Natural Gas VAR due to the breaking apart the Rockies/SoCal 
basis correlation.  This am, we were attempting to get firm numbers on the 
effect on our corporate limits so that we could provide 
Jeff/Delainey/Lavorato/Buy/.... the information to make decisions whether or 
not to reduce positions.  The number was not firm until 11 am houston time.  
My understanding is that the Houston numbers were all in before 8 am and that 
we were waiting for London.  While I am sure that there are issues all around 
and I do not think that anyone Senior in Houston is even aware, let alone 
prepared to blame, I fear that this will not always be the case.  I think 
something needs to be changed in our process so that this can be avoided in 
the future.   

Please do not take this as a nasty-gram.  No one is cc'd or bcc'd.  I just 
think that it will be deemed unacceptable.
Any thoughts/comments?
Ted

Meeting.  I regret the delay in processing the minutes.  The career placement 
center has been really busy and I needed to contact them to get some of the 
questions answered from the meeting.  For those of you who were unable to 
attend, I have listed the topics of discussion:

Goals for Wellesley - Hiring goal of 4 (not limited to)
Analyst Program changes - Structure ( Team Leaders), Developmental Program, 2 
day interview process
Interview Training Workshop - Everyone that will be interviewing is required 
to attend a 2 hour session
Roles and Responsibilities - Role of team members, Participation is tracked 
for PRC recognition.
Wellesley Campus Plan
 - We discussed the presentation time being pushed back.  I was able to get 
it pushed back to 5:00  o'clock at the latest.  There are other companies 
scheduled to present on that date and that was the  latest time we coud get.  
There will be no class conflicts on that date (September 28, 2000).   We  
discussed the attire for the presentation being casual (jeans).  That concept 
was  proposed to the  career placement center Assistant (Bernice Tita) and 
she said that casual attire will be well received.   We would need to just 
indicate it when we publicize the event.
 - We discussed changing the interview dates due to scheduling conflicts.  
The dates that we were  able to get were November 20th and 21st. 
 - We discussed possible recruiting at neighboring schools(Smith & Mt. Holy 
Oke)
 - We discussed taking the company jet to some or all the events, especially 
when we will be   involving recruiting efforts at the neighboring schools.
Target Groups -  Economic Student Board Association, All majors

I have forwarded the Wellesley recruiting guide to those of you who were 
unable to attend.  If you have not received it by now, please contact me and 
I will get one to you a.s.a.p.

I have meetings scheduled with Jean Mrha and Cindy Olson to work on the 
participants for the events and afterwards I will get the revised campus plan 
to the team.  If you have any questions regarding the contents of this e-mail

Hope you had a good trip to Dallas, although it was a bit interrupted with
you trip back to Houston for Meagan's Open House.  Dad and I would like be
with you all on Friday the 20th of October.  I believe that may have been the

Subject: MG : MO/BO Functional Groups and Reporting Lines

Please find attached a workbook comprising two worksheets. These worksheets 
illustrate how Support for the London based MG businesses - Financial Trading 
and Merchanting - plug in to the excelr Europe framework.



Org

This sheet illustrates the main reporting lines for the Front, Middle and 
Back Office(s) up to the ""Office of the Chair"" for excelr Europe. Though the 
Mechanting business is used for illustrative purposes, for Financial Trading 
simply substitute Mike Farmer and Howard Carter with Michael Hutchinson and 
Kevin Rhodes respectively.

Staff

This sheet simply attaches names to each of the Middle and Back Office 
functional groups indicated in the sheet entitled Org. Staff within the 
Middle Office functional groups have been introduced to the dual reporting 
concept whereby they report to both the Business Controller and Functional 
Lead. 

The intention is that quite soon after moving into excelr House the functional 
teams for both Financial Trading and Mechanting will start to more closely 
together. The influence of the Functional Leads should ensure that these 
teams are blended into a generic excelr Metals support group, where possible 
leveraging across the other trading support groups.

Any questions, please call x 34264.

Aug 25.  This is a listing of what's been going on.


            TIME PDH
DATE     COMMODITY BOOK GIVEN TO TRADER   SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION

8/25/00 ENPOWER - WEST  7:05    Original    West cash flows did not look 
right.  Valerie left voice mail
         late Thursday night stating not to treat the $18M gain as
          final.  She indicated that Lavorato was going to review the
         cash flows  this morning and she will let us know the final
          number at that time.  These cashflows created a $19,000
         PV01 affect. 
        
     7:45    Re-ran w/old West CF  After consulting with Pushkar, we 
replaced  the new west              cash flows with prior days so hedging 
could begin.

    10:15   Final    Spoke with Monica Lande at 9:30am and she stated that 
the             original cash flows received were real. We then had to 
         bring the original cash flows back and re-do the PDH 
         reports.

8/28/00 refer to email sent by Sheila on this day.

8/29/00 UK-NAP-LT-PRC 7:35     Cash flows received from the UK book looked 
really weird. 
         The $38M cash flow curve change created a 15,000 PV01
         affect.  We contacted Guy Freshwater regarding.  He
         indicated that per Mark Fondren, the book was officialized 
         Monday, on Friday since Monday was a Holiday for their 
         Office.  We backed out the new cash flow, and then substituted
         the old ones.

8/30/00 UK-NAP-LT-PRC 7:30  Original    The same thing happened as 8/29/00.  
The book was not officialized  
    7:45  Final    on 8/29, therefore we received the same incorrect cash 
flows.  We again
         substituted these cash flows with those received on 8/25/00.  I 
talked with
         Mark Fondren and he indicated that the book has now been 
officialized.
         (In the past we have not had issues with the UK commodity Books in 
the 
         ERMS system. )

8/31/00 ENPOWER - WEST 7:20  Original    Cash flows received for west created 
a 14,000 PV01 affect.  We contacted
    8:00  Final    Monica Lande and she informed us that there was a $14 M 
loss in their book, 
         but $6 M was not real.  We asked for a cash flow strip for the 
incorrect flows, but          she was not able to provide it.  Therefore, we 
used the previous day's cash
         flows.  After the 7:20 PDH report, the system started running slow, 
therefore
         it took even longer to produce a revised report.

FYI - Nice note from the Chicago office regarding the roll-out and training 
in Unify. As you might know they are live on September 1 with Unify. 
Currently they are only pathing on NGPL but we expect them to expand to 
include both Trunkline and Northern Border. They have elected not to EDI 
until  they get more comfortable with the system (maybe for October 
business). 

We will continue to develop their staff on the use of Unify through

were very complementary of Richard and they now feel confident that they will

There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by excelr, acted much as trading offices. They are very 
small.
We have worked with the people in Metals to put in place extra controls so 
that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in a 
designated Trading Office own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate (get a price from a Trading Office for every deal), and some 
execute for Trading Offices (are given a range within which they can execute 
trades).

 is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
Tab 'Office Models' shows which functions are performed in which type of 
office
Tab 'Office List' shows the actual offices involved 
We propose to re-examine this methodology in 6 months' time.
Buy-in has been obtained from the cc list and the people on the ground.

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Are you both happy with this approach?
Are there any extra controls you would like to see in place?

Over the past year or so excelr has made a great impact at the University of 
Oklahoma.  In a very short time we have become one of the employers of
of choice within the College of Business.  We have been able to do this by 
paying attention to details and going beyond the necessary.  We have formed
great relationships and planted seeds that will reap benefits for years to 
come, if we do not become complacent.  I for one am an example of the 
impression
that excelr has forged at OU.  I am here because I believe that excelr 
represents one of the greatest opportunities in not only the energy industry, 
but the 
but the business world in general.

I am sending this note because I believe we are taking steps that will lessen 
our momentum at the University of Oklahoma.   I have learned that we will
not be sponsoring any entertainment for our presentation this fall.   As you 
know, last year we sponsored a hypnotist and a drama team for entertainment 
after our presentations.  Being a student at the time I felt this was a great 
idea and I know that my fellow students enjoyed the presentations as well.  
They felt that it was a great opportunity to gain insight from excelr 
representatives as well enjoy the entertainment which we provided.  As I 
understand the A/A program now takes the position that this does not provide 
any residual value for excelr and does not warrant the expense.  I do not 
understand this reasoning and feel that there is great value in such an 
arrangement.  It places another selling point on our presentation and gives 
us a better opportunity to familiarize ourselves with upcoming talent.   This 
may seem like an  insignificant detail,  but I hope we will see the value 
that this opportunity presents.  The students of the EM Program and the J.C. 
Penney Leadership Program are expecting another exciting evening from excelr 
and hate to see us fall short of these expectations.  It is very likely that 
if we do not sponsor this event one of our competitors will.  The competition 
for talent is growing and we can not allow ourselves to become overconfident 
in our recruiting efforts.  excelr is a great place to work and we must take 
that image to campus.   I know that Mr. McConnell is a very exciting speaker 
and will no doubt amaze those present.  That is why we should take this 
simple step to have as many potential leaders present as possible and 
continue our path to recruiting dominance at the University of Oklahoma.

I am fully aware that you were the instrumental element in putting OU within 
excelr's sights.  Your involvement at OU is greatly appreciated and I hope you 
maintain
your interest in the University of Oklahoma.  Please consider my views on 
this matter and express any concerns of your own to the Analyst and Associate 
Program.

year) Eric Gonzales will be moving back to Houston to work exclusively on 
co-managing excelr's LNG markets.   We are very appreciative of Eric's efforts 
in Europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very 
closely with his LNG team in the coming years.  From this point forward Eric 
will focus his remaining time in Europe exclusively on financially closing 
Arcos.

We are therefore making the following changes immediately.   The origination 
responsibility for Italy will be moved under  Eric Shaw.  Ricardo Bortolloti 
will continue in the role as Italian Country Manager and will report to Eric 
Shaw.   Mariano Gentilini will become our Country Manager for Spain and 
Portugal and will report directly to the excelr Europe Office of the Chairman.

The Arcos Power Project is likely to create a large gas to power spread 
position and so we have asked Paul Mead to assume the added responsibility 
for our natural gas risk positions in Spain.  This position is much more 
likely to be supplied and influenced by LNG rather than Continental Gas 
markets and Paul will  work quite closely with both excelr Global Markets and 
the Continental Gas team.

Ross Sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in Holland will also 
head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power 
transmission opportunities across Europe.   Among the prospects his team will 
pursue include projects  from Norway to the UK,  Sweden to the Continent,  
and bidding on existing French interconnector capacity.   He will report  to 
Eric Shaw for the Holland markets and to Richard Lewis for the Transmission 
responsibilities.

Finally the Continental Gas team is interacting far more with our UK gas team 
than our power teams on the Continent.  Therefore David Galagher who manages 
our Continental Gas team  will now report directly to Richard Lewis.

We have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that  these 
changes will create the right links to optimize our performance.  Please help 
make these changes as smooth as possible.

Subject: Controls needed to ensure cashflows are received by Infinity

Shona, Brent and Sally,
This morning, the cash flows from approximately 75 books were not received by 
Infinity from the ERMS system.  We normally get 375 books and only got 296 
this morning.

Per conversation with Joyce Kuo and Mike Moscoso, Susan Trevino, Risk 
Controls,  and Christian, RAC, changed the book heirarchy on Friday, moving 
global products books, including the prepays, out of the ECT group and into 
another group.  We have had discussions in the past verifying with Risk 
Controls that the ECT group is the only group which automatically sends its 
cash flows to Infinity.  Other cash flows from books are included only by 
being listed in a script.  This was not done when the books were moved from 
the ECT Group on Friday.

Obviously, the Rate & Currency is not able to hedge excelr's cash flows when 
so much has been omitted.   At this time we are about one hour away from a 
good Hedging report for the trading desk.  This report is due the desk daily 
by 7:30 am.

Mike and I discussed the need for controls and sign-off by him or Shona for 
changes in book heirarchy.

Please find below the issues, action taken, and action plan / proposed 
resolution for GCP / SAP / Mid Office Systems interface.
If you have further questions/comments, please feel free to contact me.

Regards,
Janet

Issues:
Brazil and Argentina Tax Code - Counterparty tax code for these countries are 
required in SAP but not in GCP.
Bank Partner Type Changes - Partner bank type changes for counterparties -- 
triggered by master data changes in GCP -- while bank data remains the same, 
resulting in invoices being paid to the incorrect bank and/or bank account.
Ownership - who owns what?

Action Taken:
Brazil and Argentina Tax Code
Meeting took place.  Agreed upon plan is for mid office user to provide tax 
requirements and/or codes to Bill.  SAP is waiting for tax requirements 
and/or codes to determine whether user exits should be disable (these are 
custom user exits SAP has implemented to accommodate the Brazil and Argentina 
tax requirements back from 1/01/00 go-live)
Bank Partner Type
Our understanding is GCP has agreed to modify the GCP program to keep bank 
partner type static.  GCP technical team is developing this solution.
Ownership
Mid Office Users own data
GCP maintains counterparty master data
GCP and SAP ensure that solution in place to move master data from GCP to SAP 
satisfy invoicing and cash processing business requirements.

Summary:
Many meetings have taken place.  Major progress has been made.  Now we need 
to evaluate GCP reengineering initiative to see whether it affects scope  and 
requirements regarding current solution in place for this 3-way interface.

Proposed Resolution:
SWAT team representing both Houston and London to be formed and meet in 
London week of Sep. 11- 15th to:
Address all issues evolving around this interface.
Develop solutions to issues, workplan, ownership, and timeline.
SWAT team members:
Janet Tran - SAP TRAPAR
Pamela LeBrane - SAP TRAPAR
Diem Pham - SAP Technical  -- Will already be in London that week for EEL
Bill Hare - GCP Functional (Houston)

To date, my primary duties have been to oversee the internal valuation of the 
contracts, and their unwind costs in our Risk books.  I have also been 
involved with the Entex contract valuation.  Dave Baumbach has been the real 
key to providing the data, and has all of the information.  Steve Jackson is 
talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional 
eyes and resources looking at this also.  I feel we have done a thorough job, 
but we do need everyone thinking of ""what if's.""  Our risk books are complex, 
with many hand-offs internally.  Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of 
the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the 
day.  I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.  After our 
meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our 
approach.  There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on 
(Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).

FYI:  I will be out of town on another project all of the week of 8/28 - 9/1, 
and Tuesday, 9/5 and Wednesday, 9/6.  I have made arrangements to ensure that 
I am in Houston on Thursday, 9/7 and Friday, 9/8 for the first visit to the

To summarize, we observed a significant improvement from the last test we 
performed a few months ago.  The systemic problems that created a large 
volume of the discrepancies in our previous testing have been greatly 
reduced.  The majority of the discrepancies identified in the most recent 
testing are primarily a result of random data entry errors and some deal 
booking changes made in the back office without the Product Control Group's 
knowledge.  Torrey has already corrected the most significant discrepancies 
and is continuing to investigate the smaller items.  

Andrew and I will both be on vacation for the week of August 28.  When we 
return, we will set up a meeting with you and Dave to discuss the final 
results once Torrey has had time to conclude his research.

helpful for you to put a call in to Tom Martin today to give him your phone 
number and to let him know that you are working closely with Dave and that 
you are available for any questions.  Nothing may come up, but I think that 
Tom would feel better with this gesture.  Probably wouldn't hurt to log the 
same call or e:mail in to the rest of the guys on the list.  That will give 
all of them a feeling of continuity with regard to information from Dave on 
this project.  Do you have contact information for Brenda?  If not, I would 
get that from Yvette Convey, her assistant.  She is making the rounds with 
Patrick Conner and the corporate development team, doing site visits on two

To date, my primary duties have been to oversee the internal valuation of the 
contracts, and their unwind costs in our Risk books.  I have also been 
involved with the Entex contract valuation.  Dave Baumbach has been the real 
key to providing the data, and has all of the information.  Steve Jackson is 
talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional 
eyes and resources looking at this also.  I feel we have done a thorough job, 
but we do need everyone thinking of ""what if's.""  Our risk books are complex, 
with many hand-offs internally.  Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of 
the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the 
day.  I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.  After our 
meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our 
approach.  There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on 
(Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).

I am in Houston on Thursday, 9/7 and Friday, 9/8 for the first visit to the

DPR.

For each business unit or commodity group in the DPR the graphs show the VaR 
compared to its limit.  

When VaR is under the limit (as in the example on the right), it appears 
green, and the unused portion of the limit appears yellow, which together add 
up to the limit amount.  When VaR exceeds the limit (as on the left), the 
limit is represented in red, and the excess is shown as a red box outlined in 
black.  One graph shows usage in dollar terms and the other as a percentage 
of the individual limits.

We should be able to publish this graph to the web report viewer as soon as 
the web masters have completed the set up.  Meanwhile, we will e-mail these 
graphs to you every day after the DPR is finalized.  Today's are attached 
below.  Please launch the Excel file instead of using the Lotus Notes viewer.

Over the past several months we have been putting together a database to 
standardize and capture the information that flows to the DPR (it is very 
much like the database we created for EOL to report numbers).  With it we can 
perform a variety of analyses (correlations between books, back-testing, 
estimating sensitivities to risk factors, P&L decomposition and attribution, 
etc.).  We are nearly finished with its construction, and we hope to provide 
you superior analytics and reports in the future.

Next week we hope to publish two new graphs: for each business unit in the 
DPR one will have 30 day rolling and 5 day rolling ROVARs (average P&L 
divided by average VaR) and the other will have 30 day rolling and 5 day 
rolling curve shift Sharpe ratios (average delta - gamma P&L divided by its 
standard deviation) .

We hope you find these useful.

Subject: Trend Analysis for Select Commodity Groups

Attached is a trend analysis on the four primary commodity groups which have 
either been demonstrating, or have been thought to be demonsrating, a decline 
in EOL transactions as a percentage of total trading activity. The graphs for 
each group represent a line plot of EOL's weekly percentage of total trading 
activity by deal count and volume over the last three months. The attachment 
also contains source data on the second and third pages, which gives the 
absolute numbers represented by the percentages shown on the graphs. These 
sheets contain several additional commodity groups which have demonstrated a 
decreasing or erratic EOL trend, but were not graphed because they averaged 
less than 10-15 total transactions (both EOL and non-EOL) per week. 

A few notes on the four graphed commodity groups:

AUSTRIAN POWER -  The overall EOL trend as a percentage of transactions in 
Austrian Power has been upward over the last three months, despite the sharp, 
temporary decrease which took place at the end of July as a result of the 
head Austrian Power Trader and Stack Manager going on holiday. Since his 
return, the percentage has picked back up and as of 8/22 about 30% of 
Austrian Power trades were once again being done through EOL. There is cause 
for concern here, however, in the fact that the absence of one trader 
effectively shut off EOL trading in this commodity group.


LPG - The LPG products have followed a somewhat erratic path since inception, 
with EOL transactions typically accounting for between 20 and 30 percent of 
total LPG trading activity. This overall trend remains intact and as of 8/22, 
EOL accounted for 26% of LPG trades.

Crude & Products - This commodity group has been demonstrating a steady 
decline in EOL trading activity over the last three months. While EOL trades 
accounted for approximately 20% of all crude and products activity in May, 
this percentage has dropped off to just over 10% as of August 22nd. This 
trend is particularly disturbing because of its consistancy, as well as the 
relatively large data pool on which it is based.


UK Power - Although the absolute number of trades in UK Power dropped off 
significantly at the end of July, EOL's percentage of UK Power transactions 
has remained fairly stable. EOL's percentage of UK Power trades ""spiked"" 
briefly during the second week of June, but outside of this the percentage of 
UK Power trading represented by EOL transactions has fluctuated between 20 
and 40 percent. On trade date 8-22, EOL transactions accounted for just over 
50% of all transactions done in UK Power.

The targets set are reasonable for your business and
As minimum standards, they are comprehensive enough (if you would like to see

fly to Bermuda from Texas.  Easy from New York, but not that much traffic 
between Houston/Austin and there.  A few years ago when we went with David's 
family to Yellowstone, we were able to get a great deal through Continental 
through their group rate department. That works when you travel with a group 
of 10 or more, all on the same itinerary.  I think that our round trip from 
Salt Lake to Houston was $235 each.  Hopefully we could arrange something 
like that.   If airfare is more like $1,000 between here and Bermuda, that 
could be tough.  

Should we pin them down on an exact location, maybe have them pick two or 
three and rank them?  Then we could check on accomodations, airfare, deals, 
etc. to see what would be most feasible.  Or should we research a few places 
and present those choices for them to consider?  What do you think?  Seems 
like there will be 13 of us, counting baby White/Lowrimore.  And what do you 
and Cara envision -- a weekend, a few days, a week?  Our kids will get out of 
school on Friday, May 25.  The 2nd of June is that following Saturday.  

We are having a great year here at excelr, especially in the business unit 
that I am in.  Hopefully, that translates to really great bonuses in early 
February.  I hope to be in a position to fund airfare and hotel for 
everyone.

Sally, I think will get out and do an Indian Rain dance, as the rain is
falling and we need lots ot that!  MY reason for writing however, is to say
that we will look forward to your having lunch with us at 12:15 on September
5th at the University of Texas Club.  Cindy said you would be in town and
that would be a fun celebration, and Cindy and family will join us.  I am
also going to invite my cousins, Fab and Mary Anne.  Cara will in New York at
that time.

The other is, I am thrilled that you and your family are going to be able to
go to Hallettsville for Dot's birthday and Cindy, Richard, and Brigeda will
be able to be there also as they were able to change their plans for the
beach to the following week-end, so I think it will be lots of  fun, and I
know it will mean a lot to Dot too.  In fact I called her today and told her
you all were going to be able to be there.  Cara will decide when she gets

easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes:

What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy
- in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the
YO Ranch or somewhere.   We might spend one night or two - plan something
fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad
with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go
somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.

Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more
special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San
Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.

This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but
provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom
and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.    Maybe we could ""chip in""
varying amounts to Mom and Dad's trip so that cindy and richard could afford
it.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Sally, 
In answer to your question regarding the approval process for sign on 
bonuses, Sheila Walton informed me of the following. 
If you are primarily in agreement regarding a small sign on bonus award,  
then no further approval process is necessary.     If the sign on bonus 
amount is substantial then approval from David Oxley is advisable.   
In our current case, a $5,000.00 sign on for a Sr. Specialist would not 
require additional approval except your own.   
I will continue to monitor sign on bonus offers and provide you with a 
recommendation based on all available factors.

I just want to summarize/clarify our discussions so far on the Commercial=
=20
Support model for excelr Japan.=20

My background:
In Europe the Commercial Support function was divided into a Middle Office=
=20
(MO) and a Back Office (BO) part, with a European controller (Fearnley Dyso=
n)=20
responsible for both functions. For Scandinavia, the only trading office in=
=20
Europe outside of London, I was responsible for both functions, as Local=20
Office controller, reporting into Barry Pearce, who reported to Fearnley. I=
n=20
Japan I also have this Local Office Controller function, as being responsib=
le=20
for MO/BO activities in this region. The MO would consist of the trading=20
related functions: Documentation (Capture & Confirmation), Risk Management,=
=20
Settlement and Trade Accounting. The BO would consist of G&A's, Salaries &=
=20
Wages, Tax, Management reporting, Statutory reporting and VAT.=20

Back Office:
I report directly to Cassandra Scultz (VP & CAO of excelr APACHI). As much a=
s=20
possible are to be outsourced to our Sydney office (Heidi Mason, who also=
=20
reports to Cassandra), but some work has to be done in Tokyo. The reasons f=
or=20
this outsourcing decision is enclosed in the Power Point presentation=20
enclosed below. For payments we use Houston Treasury, as they are the only=
=20
ones that can exercise a payment in the banking systems.



Middle Office:

Mandate
What I have in writing is a section from Joe Hirl's Memo (Request for Japan=
=20
Power Trading Positions (DRAFT)) to Rick Buy and Greg Whalley dated April 1=
9=20
this year (please find enclosed)

Back Office Operations:  Jan Erland Bekeng in cooperation with Sally Beck=
=20
will look to establish the local risk books in Tokyo and define any=20
system     modifications necessary given the characteristics of the Japanes=
e=20
electricity market.  excelr Japan will handle trade capture      and risk=20
management while confirmations and settlements will occur in Houston under=
=20
Sally Beck=01,s supervision.  IT support and     system modification will b=
e=20
overseen by Anthony Dayao and performed in Houston.



Discussion -  Current & Future Situation
I see more commodities than Power. Metals will arrive September 25, Weather=
=20
is on the way from Sydney, and Garry Hickerson will from September 1 have a=
=20
guy here doing IRFX, Agri and maybe Equity.  We are also looking into Oil=
=20
deals, and have plans for Gas, Coal, Pulp & Paper, Credit and Emissions. Al=
so=20
EBS is on the way. I only see Metals, IRFX and Weather as active desks this=
=20
year, maybe Oil. Power will take some more time to get active, due to the=
=20
very closed market situation here right now. On the Origination side we mig=
ht=20
see some structures/cross commidity/finance deals go through. Thus we have =
a=20
mix of activites from excelr APACHI, excelr Global Markets, EBS and excelr=20
Metals. Basically everyone wants to do some business in Japan.

To coordinate all these activities we need to build the most cost efficient=
,=20
independent, segregated, automised and service minded Japanese Commercial=
=20
Support function possible. To accomplish these objectives, outsourcing to=
=20
Sydney is an alternative that has been discussed extensive lately, and is=
=20
highly recommended from our side. Labour costs in Sydney is 25% of the cost=
s=20
in Tokyo. Due to Sydney's experience and size they are ready to expand and=
=20
take on this project. They already have the segregation and independence in=
=20
place, and would give us an extra layer of segregation in the sense of bein=
g=20
an intermideary between Tokyo and Houston. Bilingual staff would be hired t=
o=20
perform Japanese services, which is widely available in Sydney. And there i=
s=20
only one hour in difference between us. Outsourcing these activities from=
=20
Japan to Australia is a growing trend, and many large corporations have don=
e=20
it this way.

There will be some time from the first trades until functions and commoditi=
es=20
are moved to Sydney. Tokyo want and needs to learn, understand all details,=
=20
automise, make routines and calibrate systems first. On the confirmation si=
de=20
our Legal department would be heavily involved in th start, compared to lat=
er=20
stages.

Proposed MO structure for excelr Japan

A) Responsibility for all Commercial Support activities in Japan to be=20
sourced to excelr Japan, under excelr Japan's CFO.

B) Outsource programmable tasks to Sydney:
 - Documentation (Capture & Confirmation)
 - Settlement
 - Trade Accounting

C) Risk Management in Tokyo.


I look forward to hear from you.

Dear UT Recruiting Team Members:

As most of you should know, we are scheduled to participate in the MPA Dinner 
Cruise on Lake Austin Wednesday, August 23 at 6:30pm.  We are co-sponsoring 
this event with KPMG, so our presence is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!!

Rick Causey will be unable to attend as he has been chosen for jury duty!!! I 
have also had a few participants notify me that they will be unable to attend.

With this in mind, I am hoping that you will make yourself available to 
participate in this event.  

Please respond via e-mail or give me a call (3-4585) and let me know if you 
will be able to represent excelr at this event.  I will then give you the 
logistics for the event.  It is scheduled to begin at 6:30, so we are 
expected to arrive between 6:00 and 6:15.

Please let me know ASAP if you will be able to help.

Thank you!

as the spot I am sure that we can find something good.  We were in Ashville a 
couple of years ago, which was very near the Blue Ridge.  We stayed at a 
place that was supposed to be terrific, but we did not care for it.  I am 
sure that there are other places in the area to research.  There may also be 
some spots around Charlottesville, also just off the Blue Ridge.  I think 
that some people from here have vacationed in that area, so I will ask around 
and see if there are any good suggestions.  In magazines, I have seen 
pictures of places in Tennessee and Georgia ( I guess they do have mountains) 
that look nice.  I will see if I can find the names of those places.

Met Mom and Dad for dinner last night.  I did some pushing for the
anniversary decision.  Mom was quite adamant about not liking cruises (Mom,
adamant?  What a shock!).  What did seem to appeal was a trip to the
mountains (really!).  She's think of N.C.--probably blue ridge.  I know
there are some ski resorts there--something like that would also offer our
little and not-so-little ones something to do.  I've been searching the web
for places during lunch.  Will compile some info and let you know...

Subject: Re: Trading v Origination Offices  

Thanks - I think this is a good start as far as roles go, but as I outlined 
to Shona last week, we should apply some basic rules to the process, (forgive 
me if obvious) for example:

Rule 1: No confirmations issued, chased or matched by remote offices

This should be done centrally and further all the customers of the remote 
office should be given contact numbers (e.g. fax) at the operations hub. That 
way any incoming confirmations etc go to the independent ops group.

Rule 2: No cash payments or receipts in respect of transactions approved or 
reconciled by remote offices

Operations hubs should reconcile cash movements to changes in position.

Rule 3: No physical settlements or receipts in respect of transactions 
approved or reconciled by remote offices

This splits the logistics process somewhat, but is essentially as with cash 
in that every movement of physical product should be approved (where 
necessary) and reconciled to movements in the position at operations hubs. 
The ""initiation/optimisation"" aspect of logistics could remain remote, since 
arguably it involves pseudo - trading.

Not exhaustive but helpful I hope.

Subject: Trading v Origination Offices

Sally, Brent,
There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by excelr, acted much as trading offices.
Shona and Naomi have worked with the people in New York to put in place extra 
controls so that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in 
New York or London own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate, and some execute for Trading Offices.

is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
All the cc above are bought in to this approach.
What do you require to be comfortable so that we can put it up to Causey and 
Buy?

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Thanks,
Richard

pledged dollars to the United Way campaign.  Large number, but still 
percentage-wise smaller than we would like.  I sent the message below to all 
Energy Operations employees on Friday afternoon.  We'll see in a few days if 
this helped on contributions.  

Text of e:mail message to Energy Operations employees:

Two weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that 
receives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to find 
out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused  
Houston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster 
parents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to 
the center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin 
and meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were 
temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to 
have made that pledge.  

excelr has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive 
matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit 
organizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your 
charitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one time 
each year that excelr invites employees to partner with the company to make a 
difference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by an 
employee is matched by excelr.  

If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing 
so as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next 
Wednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making a 
pledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all excelr 
employees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.  Log on to 
http://unitedway.excelr.com to complete your pledge card.

pledge.    ",Non Abusive

Dear Mr. Taylor:

Per our conversation, I would like to apply for a suitable position in the
Risk Management division.

Since PG&E relocated to Bethesda, MD, I went to work as a contract employee
with El Paso Merchant Energy. Due to the merger of El Paso with
Coastal/Engage, my days are pretty much numbered at El Paso.

I have enclosed my resume for your review.

I thank you for your time and thoughtfulness.

Sincerely,

what the timing would be, how we might suggest organizing and prioritizing

interested (nor available) for a month's worth of work.  Todd's tendency 
(remember this with weather, too) is to think that he has to do all of the 
work himself.  He has had enough experience that his organization, guidance 
and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work 
himself.  If James' list looks long and involved, how could Todd lead these 
efforts, what kind of team might he ask James to provide, what additional 
short-term resources might we be able to tap into in Houston, etc.  We have 
to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to James.  If 
you are willing, I would be glad to explore this with Todd and challenge him 
to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort, but not do all

I don't see any huge problems with Todd helping out Continental Power.  He 
needs to spend some time in Oslo anyways reviewing the weather business 
there.  I agree that one month might be unreasonable and would look to Todd 
to determine the proper timeframe.  I will talk to Todd and Mike Jordan

As we said before, I would like to be able to utilize Todd Hall for special 
projects from time to time.  I had mentioned to Mike Jordan that once Todd 
completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of 
his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely 
with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.  I don't know about the one 
month timeframe.  I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and 
determine the best way to proceed.  It might mean a couple of weeks over 
there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.  I 
don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly 
without the family.  Can we still use Todd ?

Sally,

As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well 
but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or 
another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable. 
Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible 
for much of what we achieved.

As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been 
significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now 
recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the 
29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas 
Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.

There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit 
from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I 
am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in Oslo 
pushing the weather Risk Management area forward). Attached is a page I put 
together that cover our immediate needs and why Todd is ideally placed to 
potentially add an enormous amount of value to the Continental Power business.

Could we please get together with Brent Price and Mike Jordan and discuss 
whether Todd would be available come over.

Thanks and regards James

as the pipeline is only as valuable as the people who operate it.

During the transition period, it is important that we keep the pipe line 
operating at our historical level of reliability in order to meet the energy 
needs of our customers.

As requested I have addressed your questions as follows:

1. Put in actual date of reviews of each office - done
2. Indicate the difference between Phase I and Phase II of London are - done
3. Indicate that we are looking at non-wholly owned subsidiaries - done 
(Marnier & EOTT)
4. AS a handout what are things that should have been cleared and weren't - 
attached - also put in global issues
5. Change the timelines for current status & reviews not yet taking place 
(Chicago, EOTT) - done
6. Send you the list of standards - attached on previous message
7. Determine what Now Sarzyna is - it is listed on the excelr Europe current 
status schedule.  It is in Poland, and it is a JY poer station that should be 
operational 
May 00 (not sure if they met the date).  Due to start operations in Q2-3.  
50% owned by excelr.
8. Send you the grid of Europe - sent in previous message.

As far as the global issues are concerned, my recommendations are:

1. Taping of phone lines - we should require for all trading offices
2. Use of mobile phones - we should ban the use of mobile phones to make 
trades
3. Translation of settled contracts - I don't think its worth the cost.  It 
can be done on an as needed basis if there are problems with the contracts 
(although
 since they are already settled it would be unlikely).
4. Enpower - for offices without the critical mass of transactions, Enpower 
is not necessary but some controlled environment is required.  If Enpower is 
not used, 
they must be reviewed more frequently.

On another topic, all of the associates Jana offered and that would fit in 
the role we were discussing are gone (3 were gone by the time we finished our 
meeting). She 
has given me additional resumes - mostly analysts, who would fit the 
position.  However, I was thinking of getting an analyst and then switching 
the person out for
Jenifer Bagwell.  When I interviewed her she wasn't keen on travelling, but I 
think its worth at least a discussion with her (since the position is a 
better fit than her current).  Do you have any thoughts either way?

Let me know if there is anything else I can help with.  You can reach me at 
212 715 5243.

Subject: Todd Hall

Sally,

As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well 
but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or 
another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable. 
Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible 
for much of what we achieved.

As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been 
significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now 
recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the 
29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas 
Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.

There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit 
from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I 
am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in Oslo 
pushing the weather Risk Management area forward). Attached is a page I put 
together that cover our immediate needs and why Todd is ideally placed to 
potentially add an enormous amount of value to the Continental Power business.

Could we please get together with Brent Price and Mike Jordan and discuss 
whether Todd would be available come over.

We have been able to work with Legal and Tax  to impact the way our trading 
has been set up in London  and Tokyo to increase our control of the business 
and simplify the requirements for support.

In London, for Equity Trading we will be trading as ECT Investments Inc. (the 
same entity as in Houston).  We will have mirror books in the UK as in 
Houston (e.g. Energy and Energy - London).  We have put a service agreement 
in place setting up a excelr Investment Services Ltd. (uk entity) who will 
trade on our behalf as an agent.  This keeps ENA from establishing a presence 
for Equity Trading in the UK Tax authority.  We pay the UK entity, our 
agent,  a service fee and deduct the service fee on ECT Investment's taxes as 
an expense.  Controls are increased because all the books and reporting 
remains consolidated into one entity. 

In Tokyo, we have started a Rate & Currency Trading Desk.  We initially were 
told by tax that we would have to trade in the name of excelr Japan.  This 
would require separate bank accounts, separate counterparty agreements and 
much more coordination to control.  We and the trader worked with Tax so they 
understood the difficulties that this would present.  Also, Japan did not 
want to assurme the funding requirements for this activity with their office 
and wanted it segregated.  This further understanding caused Tax to push 
further to gather other advise from outside counsel operating in the Tokyo 
market.  
We are and will be able to trade as ENA.  Therefore, the same bank accounts 
and ISDAs may be utilized.  All activity, positions and VAR continues to be 
netted for ENA.  Additionally our counterparties can trade with a trusted, 
established entity, ENA, and we get to net, limiting exposure.

These are two cases where we can impact the structure of the business to 
increase controls and our level of support.  In both cases, joint and 
successful cooperation occurred between trading, tax, legal and operations.

I am working within European Financial Operations on integrating the MG 
companies within the monthly status report for excelr offices - please see 
attached.  The data held so far on this document has been obtained from our

In order to obtain an update on the progress made with the integration of the 
North American Trading and the Americas Origination companies I was hoping

As I indicated in my voicemail message to you, attached is the document 
outlining my notes regarding the infrastructure development that needs to 
occur in order to support an active transportation capacity trading market.  
The transportation world is quickly changing and I believe our ability to 
actively trade transportation is getting ready to multiply.  Whether ENA ends 
up developing a capacity trading system or not, our business in that area is 
going to change immensely and we must be prepared to deal with it as soon as 
possible.

I would appreciate it if you would look at the attached document and review 
the Sitara related projects (all of which we have discussed previously), let 
me know what resources you have available to work on these things, and where 
you see it in the priority list.  Since I do not know what other projects you 
are working on, it is impossible for me to know what is most important, so 
I'd appreciate knowing where you see this fitting in and an estimated time 
for completion.  I'll be more than happy to meet with you to discuss these 
projects again in more detail to help you better understand the needs.

Subject: Re: MG Integration : Resource Requirements  

A good tee up - and one we should regularly reassess - here goes some initial 
feedback which you should push back on :-

Valuation review - resource requirement to be defined in detail by Andy in 
his new role - I think the offer from Eric of finding some Analysts and 
Associates for the short term assessment may be the immediate answer.

Balance Sheet substantiation - at present I assess the power and gas 
substantiation process as priority - although we should review the resources 
coming free from Global ( Chris and Rashpal ) as they may not be easily 
useable by Raewyn - Chris is free at present and Rashpal promised for 
Thunderball. Whilst I am as concerned as you are we should reassess level of 
risk because
AA would have done ( could do more ? ) some substantive / due diligence on 
balance sheet
The trade accountants at MG had a simplistic entity structure based around an 
infrastructure where the AS400 did both the DPR and account posting  - unlike 
our own systems - so inherent risk is lower ( excluding inventory )
we must make certain our efforts are aligned to Fin Ops !

Inventory - interesting one this - it should be very accurately controlled 
already ( it is the business ??? ) yet the problem is that it is not 
transparent at the consolidation level. I would like you to get David Tregar 
to assess the level of risk with you ( and discuss with me and Philip Lord 
the current securitisation of inventory ) before we put an action plan in 
place for this balance sheet category

Integration / Controls - you should continue your efforts to bring the MG 
priority to the functional stripe leaders' agenda - after Friday's meeting 
they know the effort required are that recruitment is key

SAP - we will look to Michael Heap on this ( but we did identify some key 
business analysis work for Kevin Rhodes to be done ASAP - we should track 
this )

Remote offices - continues to be the dog that has not barked ( YET ) - 
Richard, you and I need to rethink where we are  - particularly with South 
America

Overall - we both agree more resources are required but they have to be 
scoped quite precisely !

Thanks for the note

Subject: MG Integration : Resource Requirements

Mike,

As you know we still have a very full issues list and we are spreading the 
few resources we have on ground pretty thinly, leaving a residue of partially 
completed tasks that will need to be revisited at some point. Also, though we 
are leveraging MG staff where we can, we have already made an assessment that 
their support infrastructure is very lean - this is being stretched to 
breaking point by the RW acquisition and various excelr integration 
initiatives, e.g. establishing functional teams.

At present we have the following resources on the ground:



We are continuing to identify issues that add to our assessment of 
operational risk. If we are to reduce this risk to an acceptable level we 
need to commit additional resources to the project. 

I assess our current resource needs as follows:

Valuation Review : the valuation review that Andy and I performed prior to 
""effective control"" date identified a number of complex valuation issues that 
require further quantitative analysis. Also, there is imbedded optionality in 
a lot of the physical business transacted throughout MG which should be 
modelled to determine the correct valuation and accounting treatment (and if 
there is any extra value to be extracted - Eric Gadd has recently prioritised 
this!). Requirement - risk manager with developed quantitative/modelling 
skills.

Balance Sheet Substantiation : a comprehensive validation of balances 
including a review of reconciliation's, evidence of account ownership 
(detection of ""88888""'s accounts etc...) is overdue. Requirement - lead 
accountant plus two juniors.

Inventory : a lot more analysis is required of the global inventory balances 
- see earlier note to Eric Gadd. Requirement - one/two risk manager(s).

General Integration : having now identified the functional leads for MG in 
London,  we are now due to involve the ""stripe leaders"" in the process of 
creating the functional groups, including identifying gaps in resourcing. I 
will not prejudge the outcome beyond saying that each functional group will 
need extra staff that I am expecting the ""stripe leaders"" to provide. 
Requirement - to be determined by ""stripe leaders"".

SAP : ??? Requirement - to be determined by SAP project team.

Remote Offices : the above requests relate to the London office only. Having 
identified excelr Controllers for the offices in the Far East I do not 
envisage significant issues integrating those offices. However, I have 
minimal understanding of what our requirements in the US and South America 
are, and propose deferring that discussion to another time...

Regards,
Tim

I will give some deep thought over the weekend in the meantime here are some
current thoughts regarding Brent's trip
First I am hopeful that a letter will go out regarding Brent before his trip
and that it clearly states that Brent will continue to report directly to
you (that sends a powerful message locally and globally) Is that going to
occur?
Assuming the above takes place what is the messaage you (Sally) want Brent
to convey on your behalf at each and every meeting he attends with his and
your people.  Thirdly I would suggest that Brent and Scott not try to hit a
homerun on this first trip. You as well as Brent and Scott do not need to
win the respect of Shankman so I strongly urge consistency, maturity and
incredible listening skills in fully understanding the DEPTH and exact
nature of the problems arising so solutions arise from the strength of the
data surrounding the core issues.

I would prepare Brent with any language you would want him to appropriately
respond to possible questions from Sheriff, Dyson, Jordan or anyone else for
that matter who might want to probe into whether all of operations is going
to roll up under you.

Until you have your meeting with Frevert I would offer that any questions
that may come Brent's or Scott's way simply be diplomatically deferred. Have
them make simple I statements ""All I know is that my role here is to.....""
I can't speak to what might be happening with other product lines.""

I will read closely your notes, please have mary solmonson give you a copy
of Freverts talk at the global systems gathering and see if there are a
couple of connection points for you to gateway your vision for global
consistency to align with his.



1) My (Sally) vision for this looks like this....
2) Why it makes sense to do this now? What's at risk if we don't do this
now? Paint a relistic yet challenging picture in hopes that he asks, Are you
Sally up to the challenge?
3) Others support this as well (Does he care, if so who else?)
4) I want to move forward effective .....Do I have your support

If you have some time on Monday let Patti know and I will give you a call.
Assuming that a letter goes out on Brent will you put a letter out on ENA
Risk, Settlementges, Logistics, other staff changes such as Scribner,
Sheila, Hall, etc. If you do not have the time to write it up let me know
and I can support you with a draft for your modification, however I would
want to talk specifics Monday.

I am very excited for you and the organization and remain hopeful that this
is yet another growth experience preparing you for an even greater role

Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation
schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on
August
28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I am
concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential
formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind
the
curve.

Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the
structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on
Brent's
role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are flying to
London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in that office
to

Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation 
schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on 
August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I 
am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential 
formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind 
the curve.  

Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the 
structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on 
Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are 
flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in 
that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  
Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points

Hi Allan:

I  am  writing  you  to express my strong interest in working at excelr Net 
Works
International Private Equity.  I am confident that my experience has prepared 
me
with  the  broad  skills  and finance expertise necessary for success in 
Private
Equity.

The rigorous curriculum in the Anderson School at UCLA has not only confirmed 
my
interest in Finance, but also enhanced my accounting skills. After 
graduation, I
spent  the first four months of my rotation program in excelr at the Asia 
Pacific
Structuring  Group. There I honed my analytical skills, commercial knowledge 
and
cross-functional team experience through financial modeling and risk 
assessment.
I  provided  robust  analytical  support that resulted in a successful bid 
for a
$550  million  power  project in China.  In the past five months at the 
Business
Development   Group  of  excelr  Broadband  Services,  I  managed  the  
strategic
relationship  between  excelr  and  Microsoft. The deal management tasks 
required
broad-based   problem-solving   skills,   effective   communication  and  
strong
understanding  of  the technology market. Recently I also proposed and led a 
new
initiative in developing broadband online gaming content for the excelr 
streaming
media business.

I  have  attached  my resume which details my accomplishments. I look forward 
to
speaking with you and further discuss my credentials in a personal interview.

when the girls were younger and had slumber parties.  

I didn't know that there were computer games that work on higher level math

I wish that we could meet for lunch.  Keep me posted on Cara  -- I have 
called her a little more frequently lately in hopes that she would spill the 
beans, but no movement on that yet!  

I think that next week we will know the schedule of games when Meagan will be 
dancing.  She did not make the dance for the first try-out.  It was jazz;  
not her strong suit.  But she did make the dances for the next two try-outs:  
a kick rountine and a pom routine.  There are two more try outs -- one more 
for kick and one more for pom. Hopefully she will make both.  Each routines 
is danced at two games -- one at home and one away.  So if she makes the next 
two dances, then she will be in 8 out of 10 dances for the football season.  
I think that she would feel pretty good about that.  The last two try-outs 
will be next week.  I will keep you posted.

Sally,

Wish we could meet downtown for lunch--if only we weren't in different
downtown!

Bummer about Meagan--I agree that physics and precalc would be a killer.
You've probably looked into this but there are some great computer
""games/drills"" for math.  Brigeda does the early ones but there are some for
the heavy duty stuff as well...

Amanda must have aced that lock/locker and changing classes thing if she
loves her classes...

Brigeda doesn't start until the 21st.  It is always a strange week when all
the other kids (and her best friend) is in school--kind of waiting week but
we should be getting ready for her party.

GREAT IDEA:  I'm going to change the clocks in my house the night of the
slumber party--to 2 hour ahead.  So they can have their midnight swim and
snack (at 10pm!).  I don't know whether this makes me a creepy or clever
mom...

Let me know when you get Meagan's football schedule...Brigeda has been
moaning about wishing she was in Houston since we left...

Today is Cara's appt with the gyn/ob--maybe an announcement will be
forthcoming.

I'm meeting a guy I took my web certification classes with on Monday.  He
owns a design firm in Georgetown and has some freelance work.  It would be
great to be able to accelerate our return to solvency!

Talk to you soon...

Cindy

about the slumber party.  When does she start school?  Today is day #2 for
the girls --Amanda loves her classes.  Meagan thought that the first day

principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her
class selection.  Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she
signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!   I don't know what she was

enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 22
deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and
add a study hall.  She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars
class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which
is probably exactly what she needs.  I was prepared to go all the way to
the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but
luckily I didn't have to go that far.

disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to

Subject: CommodityLogic.com

Mike,
Further to our conversation, here are some of the things I thought of while 
speaking with Tom Gros. There are definitely some challenges we have to 
overcome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic.com as successful as 
excelrOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara.

I won't repeat thoughts about how we split CL from excelr, but let's put 
ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a 
potential solution. Well, that's an easy decision, somebody else is doing the 
hard work, and not charging us very much for it. So sign-up, but don't rely 
on anything until we see everything working.

Handling counterparties not using the system
The challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the 
Hub is wonderful, but until everybody is using the Hub, we have to keep other 
procedures and systems going, which stretches resources, Development, IT 
Support and user. This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero - the 
concept is wonderful, but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone 
else one trades with using the system. This is classic Chicken and Egg. Tom 
has a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this. This is taking us 
closer to an outsource-to-Andersen-consulting model which is certainly 
achievable, although not quite such an easy sell.

How much resource is left
The latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people, who 
are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving 
onwards. How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL, and 
then review what is left in the remaining environment. Does it mean we hold 
off doing anything? If we do then increasing volume means that we might end 
up incurring costs for massive numbers of people! We should go through 
costing for ""What happens if we completely stop development of X project?"". 
If that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else 
comes along then it may be cheaper than developing, but I hope in most cases 
it is not!

E.g. first application in April 2001 only covers 20 fields
This is excellent, and we needn't shout it too loud to investors in CL, but 
for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be 
years before we can switch off many internal systems.
We might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 
years out?

Include European aspects from the beginning
This really isn't very difficult so long as one has some long-on-common-sense 
Europeans (not just Brits) involved in both specification and development 
from the beginning, but an as example of how not to do it, look at EnPower 
which took a year to allow just for currencies etc!

80-20 rule for types of transaction
EOL has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first.
Once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting (DTL) and risk 
(RisktRAC?) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on STP, 
and yet-to-become-vanilla products on explicitly different, manual 
approaches. Until that time, we have a strong desire to include as many 
different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system, which 
makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly (Think of 
certain deals in Power99 which are approximations of the actual deals, and 
manually tweaked every so often)

Testing
Tom's first thought is that we could leverage initial users (who would not 
pay) to do much of the testing.
EOL clearly got its testing done, but other experience shows that in order to 
have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different 
phases - component, system, integration, end-to-end, and then user-acceptance.
EOL saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many 
external users early in the process. It did have massive 
resource-commandability and so obtained input from many traders. Do the 
Support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the 
same sort of user attention? Given how often I hear ""short people"", that 
strikes me as something which in London would require significant additional 
resource, even after MG is absorbed.

Further to our conversation, here are some of the things I thought of while 
speaking with Tom Gros. There are definitely some challenges we have to 
overcome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic.com as successful as 
excelrOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara.

I won't repeat thoughts about how we split CL from excelr, but let's put 
ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a 
potential solution. Well, that's an easy decision, somebody else is doing the 
hard work, and not charging us very much for it. So sign-up, but don't rely 
on anything until we see everything working.

Handling counterparties not using the system
The challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the 
Hub is wonderful, but until everybody is using the Hub, we have to keep other 
procedures and systems going, which stretches resources, Development, IT 
Support and user. This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero - the 
concept is wonderful, but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone 
else one trades with using the system. This is classic Chicken and Egg. Tom 
has a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this. This is taking us 
closer to an outsource-to-Andersen-consulting model which is certainly 
achievable, although not quite such an easy sell.

How much resource is left
The latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people, who 
are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving 
onwards. How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL, and 
then review what is left in the remaining environment. Does it mean we hold 
off doing anything? If we do then increasing volume means that we might end 
up incurring costs for massive numbers of people! We should go through 
costing for ""What happens if we completely stop development of X project?"". 
If that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else 
comes along then it may be cheaper than developing, but I hope in most cases 
it is not!

schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on 
August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I 
am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential 
formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind 
the curve.  

Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the 
structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on 
Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are 
flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in 
that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  
Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points 
will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation 
with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he 
wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he 
will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts 
are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly 
comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to 
report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic 
around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I 
had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility 
for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.  
That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that 
down before the end of the month.  

What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The 
summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have 
checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, 
with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  

I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August 
much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL 
operations.  I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, 
rather than arrive at the party late.  ",Non Abusive

 2) Development of a methodology to re-run correlations (factor loadings) 
including criteria, responsibilities and acceptance/rejection criteria
 3) Development of process by which to analyze the output of factor loading 
process.  Database to store output and management reports.
 4) Finalize debate on the calculation of Forward/Forward volatility
 5) Scope a project to analyze the possibility of calculating hourly

Dear Rick:

As you may know, I have recently assumed the duties of PPA/MPA Director at
The University of Texas at Austin. In my new capacity, I shall be
responsible for the 2000 Fall Lyceum Series, scheduled by my predecessor,
Dr. Don Tidrick.

I understand that you will be addressing our 4th Year PPA students on
""Global Equity Markets"" in the Lyceum on Wednesday, November 1, from 5:00
to 6:30 p.m. (approximately), in UTC 2.102A. Both the students and I are
looking forward to your presentation.

In advance of the presentation, could you provide me with a brief biography
for introduction purposes?

If you have any questions concerning the Lyceum, or if I can facilitate
your Lyceum presentation in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Very truly yours,

of fun to be up here.  The appreciation for the jobs that we do in operations

many others.  

My family is doing great.  The children start school tomorrow.  Meagan will 
be a junior in high school -- we took a brief trip with her this summer for 
an early look at some colleges.  It will be a big year for Amanda -- she 
starts junior high in 6th grade.  And Tyler would tell you proudly that he is

Sally --

I acted impulsively when I saw you this a.m.  I was so excited to know you 
were on the 33rd floor where I was picking up United Way shirts that I didn't 
control my enthusiasm over seeing you.

I apologize if I disrupted you.

P.S.  I hope your family is doing fine.  Erin graduates in December from 
UT-Dallas with her masters in Speech Path.  She and her husband are doing 
very well and very much in love.

As we discussed, you will be heavily involved in constructing and 
implementing global standards and global reporting.  This is a strategic 
initative requested by the commercial teams as well as Causey.  This 
absolutely must be in place by the end of the year.

Essentially, there are three main areas:

develop global (minimum) standards
develop & implement exception reporting to these standards
develop & implement global operation reporting

I have put together milestones for us to work by in these projects:

Global operating performance

This  will be the monthly reporting package.  Currently we do this for N. 
America.  We need to establish a reporting format for the products/locations 
currently not included in this package.  The package is not intended to be 
incorporated into the current package, but use it as a guide to create our 
own.

Timeline:
Aug 31 - Finalize what will be reported
Sept 15 - Finalize reporting lines (who we are getting this info from @ each 
location and who is receiving and consolidating it)
Sept 30 - Close of business for sept 30 we should have our first consolidated 
reporting package to report
Oct 30 - Collect feedback from 1st reporting package and redesign reporting 
if necessary (continual improvements)

Global standards time line (daily reporting)

This will be the exception reporting based on the global standards we 
create.  This will be a daily reporting package.

Timeline:
August 31 - finalize global standards into 2 buckets
Quantitative (to be reported daily)
Qualitative (to be reviewed within doorstep reviews)
Sept 15 - Establish measurable targets for quantitative standards
Sept 30 - Finalize reporting format for quantitative reporting lines (who do 
we get it from, who consolidates it, who sees it, how often)
Nov 30 - Have reporting implemented - start reporting

Regards

SHona

PS - I'm also working on developing a monthly reporting summary for each 
office concerning what the latest developements are, much like they have in 
London.  I have Maria working on developing a list of all offices.",Non Abusive

Each of you has been chosen to represent excelr for our Fall 2000 recruiting 
efforts at the University of Texas.  As part of the team, you will be 
challenged with choosing the best candidates from UT to join our Analyst 
Program.

Our first campus event will be on Monday, August 21 and interviews will be 
held on campus October 4 and 5.  I have a variety of campus events planned, 
so I hope you are all able to participate.

We will be more formally organizing ourselves in the next couple of weeks.  
Currently, we are planning to have a brief team meeting during the week of 
August 14th in order to make introductions, inform you about the Analyst 
Program, and discuss the fall recruiting calendar.  To that end, please 
contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

I will notify you once the team meeting date is set.  

I look forward to meeting you all soon.

25588,beck-s/all_documents/1724.,<32074391.1075855786541.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I wanted to update you on a few items for the Calgary office.  We have 
continued to recruit for the Risk group.  On Tuesday, August 8, Brian Gillis 
will be starting as a manager in the Risk group.  Brian was previously a 
controller at Koch and was someone that Drew Lynch had tried to recruit 
previously when Brian was at Price Waterhouse.  The expectation for Brian is 
that he will learn our Risk systems and assume some of the leadership role 
for the junior risk employees from Kathy Reeves.  This will get Kathy out of 
the day-to-day risk activities, and allow me to broaden her skill sets 
outside of the Risk area.  Kathy is the best candidate to train as backup for 
me (not that I am planning to leave anytime soon!), so I want her to spend 
some time in the documentation area and eventually logistics.  We are still 
looking for one additional risk person because of the power activities which 
will be significantly increasing by year end.

In the documentation department, I have promoted Dianne Seib to a Lead 
position.  Dianne is very strong and will now assume work direction and 
performance review responsibilities for the eight employees in that 
department.  I have also hired one senior clerk who will start on September 
1st in preparation for the increased power activities.  This will give the 
new person time to train on physical and financial confirmations prior to the 
start up of the power trading.

I will be loaning Chris Wiebe to the IT group for a three-month period to 
work on developmental IT activities.  Many of the departments in Calgary have 
need for higher level excel skills, macros, queries from the various 
databases, development of access databases, etc. that will increase the 
efficiency of our processes.   Chris has a lot of skills in these areas.  
Because we are not sure if this position is a long-term or short-term 
requirement for Calgary, we will put Chris into this role for three months 
and then evaluate the status of the position at that time.  Chris will still 
work part-time in my department particularly with respect to input on the 
next generation systems requirements which are now underway. 

Because of the addition of three risk employees that were not previously 
budgeted for, I will be exceeding my budget for the remainder of the year.  I 
know that Houston is in the same situation, but I wanted to make sure you 
were aware that Calgary will have the same issue.  Both Rob Milnthorp and Jon 
McKay are aware of the situation, and were supportive of the expansion of the 
risk department as they ultimately benefit from this.

I don't know if you've picked any tentative dates for your trip to Calgary, 
but I wanted to let you know that Beth Perlman is also planning a trip up 
this month.  We had tentatively talked about sometime during the week of 
August 21st.  I haven't been able to confirm her final plans as she has been 
on vacation for the past two weeks.

This is my schedule for the remainder of August:

 Vacation;  August 14 - 18
 Customer event: Monday - August 21
 Back office golf tournament - afternoon of August 28th
 Cross-Alta golf tournament - afternoon of August 29th

The back office golf tournament is an annual event and includes all of my 
staff and Laura's and is a lot of fun.  We have a mix of golfers and 
non-golfers so we set it up as a no-pressure scramble tournament.  If you 
want to come on the 28th, we'd be happy to include you in the tournament.

Thanks again for talking to Wes about Laura Scott.  I really appreciate it.  
Just something to think about, since Laura has the client services function 
for Calgary, would it make sense if she reported to you instead of Wes?

Talk to you soon.

His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it 
would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on 
July 1.  Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth 
transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen 
would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance 
review being based on his work for ENA.  Stephen is very talented and will no 
doubt do a great job at EBS.  During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his 
heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct 
reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our 
other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.  It was his 
failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs 
Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.   It is the r
elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that 
category.

we tried to close out the month of July.  Not to go into any details but 
there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused the 
issues we saw on Monday and to a lesser degree on Tuesday.  Almost all of the 
issues relate to the quirkiness of the current version of Sybase which is 
used for Unify's database.  Jeff Johnson and his team are putting together a 
plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in 
acceptable performance as we go through next bidweek and try to close for 
August.  The short term tactical plans include the following:

Enhancing certain programs which seem to have become resource hogs as the 
amount of data grows.
Test and hopefully migrate to the latest version of Sybase which will address 
some of the issues.  This may also require some hardware changes as to where 
we store certain data.  We will also need some user help in stress testing 
prior to moving to production.
Addressing with the users billing transactions that have never been finaled.  
I have been told that we still have transactions going back to Jan of 99 that 
have not been finaled or closed out.  This puts quite a load on the PMA and 
accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see 
what if any action should be taken with these transactions.

Once these changes have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little 
time to absorb the tremendous growth we've been seeing via EOL  then we will 
focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions.  These 
include the following:

Rewriting most of the code and moving to a 3 tier environment which will be 
much more scalable.
Moving off of Sybase and on to Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle.  It will be 
easier to move Microsoft SQL Server but we have to be sure it is the right 
solution in the long term.

Jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed 
plan.  Needless to say that this is his groups highest priority and his best 
people are working on these efforts.  This will slow down major enhancement 
efforts such as enhancing the gas applications to handle hourly trades and 
nominations.  We will keep you informed as we start to roll out the tactical 
solutions.  In the mean time feel free to contact me at x-36858 or Jeff at 
x-39694 if you have any questions or require additional detail.  Thanks!  -

Subject: update on offsite

I am happy to report that, because so many people wanted to bring a ""first 
lieutenant"", Rick and Cindy have agreed to put the primary focus of the Aug 
29-31 offsite on financials and procurement, with enough HR representation to 
cover some of the broad strategic issues that cross multiple functional 
areas.  

Consequently, Elise and Mike will be able to attend.  More information on 
logistics to follow within two weeks.  We will block off hotel rooms, etc. in 
the meantime.  

As with the last ASE, it's an ""all or nothing"" proposition.  Because of the 
structure of the event, participants must be there from start to finish (no 
partial attendance).  We are still trying to get it to 2 days, but worst case 
we will set it so that people can fly up Tuesday morning and fly back 
Thursday night.

I am looking forward to everyone's participation and input.Thanks!

Hey guys I need your help

There is one Topic that we still can't seem to get taken care of: S2M1T2.

Sally rewrote the storyboards and, according to my understanding, it was
handed off to Emrul and then Cindy fixed the html pages for the revised
content. But on the server we still have the old version of these files.

What is going on with these files? Gerry would you be able to figure out
what's happening? Did it get to Emrul? Did it get to Cindy? Did it get
posted? Did older versions get copied over the newer versions?

We *need* to get this Topic done for review-- it was due to Linda almost a
week ago. Can you please let me know when it's ready for my review and edit,
so we can get it out to Linda.

Thanks,

Dear Energy Operations:

As I have reflected upon the accomplishments of this group, I wanted to 
express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have 
demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that.  

Although we have done much, we have much yet to do.  Therefore, as we go 
forward, I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the 
best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are 
removed.

To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen 
Corporation -- to survey our organization; to ""take its pulse"" if you will; 
to help us understand what we do well and not so well; in essence, to assist 
us in acquiring the ""necessary tools"" and breaking down any ""barriers.""  SJBC 
is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like our to 
help on issues like this.  SJBC will meet with members of our group in a 
private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns, 
ask our questions, make our comments, and the like.  This collective 
information (who said what is not disclosed) then is studied by SJBC with the 
goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.

Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC 
consultant.  Please schedule a time to partcipate at your earliest 
opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we 
cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it 
will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not 
received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts 
with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and 
Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.

Communication is one of excelr's core values.  I want to stress that, only by 
open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.  Thank 
you.

Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure

Interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by Tim - 
says a lot about the way MG do business I think.

RE NY we should ask the same questions - what prepayments exist ( Philip 
Bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a DASH for each prepayment on a 
contract ) add to this the absence of credit people in NY and we may have 
some issues - although Marcelo and others stressed the fact that Concentrates 
appeared to move no product without a letter of credit, which was then often 
discounted to realise cash!!

Shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue - another comment 
yesterday from Philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were 
'unique' - whilst I can accept that each may be tailored to customer 
preferences - they still need to be CACSed - we should look at the 
enforceability/legal risk here.

Whilst information prepayment risk for Metals should come from London - 
accessing any relevent inofrmation from NY may be helpful

Will call later !

Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure

The situation at present is as follows:

MG have nine open contracts with four counterparties sourcing mainly copper 
from the Russian Federation on a prepayment basis

all contracts are on a floating price basis (LME less discount)

notional value of each contract is circa $0.5-3mm

prepayment is on a unsecured trade finance basis, for between 90-95% value 
with balance on exchange of title evidenced by documents

The issues break down into three broad areas:

1) Commercial

At present excelr does not engage in prepayment activities with Russian 
Federation counterparties.

No further prepayments are permitted until RAC have performed a DASH for this 
activity. As this is likely to take several weeks Howard will liase with 
Commercial to manage issues with existing prepayment counterparties arising 
from this suspension. Howard and David Hardy will also take immediate steps 
to manage down existing prepayment exposures.

2) Legal

Based on a cursory review of the confirmations by Robert, if we are to 
continue this activity Legal need to instructed to perform a full review for 
several reasons, including:

the confirmations contain ambiguous language concerning basic economic terms, 
e.g. pricing date

they are light on the mechanics of the prepayments, and are generally not 
constructed in an appropriate way for this type of activity.

""Conditions of Purchase"" are attached to the confirmations which refer to 
English Law, but as they are not always countersigned, under conflict rules 
the closest or real connection may be deemed to be Russian law which, in the 
absence of a properly executed agreement raises concerns about enforceability.

there are several ""open"" contracts with volumetric shortfalls where we are 
beyond the delivery period, and which could be considered to have been 
discharged by breach. Again the confirmation does not contain adequate 
language.

3) Credit/Operational

There are no formal counterparty limits. Nor are prepayment and volumetric 
exposures tracked on a contract by contract basis. This information is 
necessarily to ensure transparency over contract performance, and needs to be 
factored into the overall credit monitoring process.

David has requested this information from MG, and will follow up this one off 
exercise by introducing a spreadsheet workaround to enable us to track 
exposures based on the methodology developed for Helsinki.


Further work is required to quantify our exposures and to demonstrate that, 
despite the issues identified with contractual terms, there is performance 
against the contracts. David is pursuing this from a Credit perspective and 
will report back to his group his findings by Friday latest.

The issues raised regarding contractual language suggest that we need to 
accelerate a planned review of contract language for all MG's activities in 
all jurisdictions. Mike and I will discuss bringing this review forward with 
Justin.

Any questions, please call.

Regards,
Tim

a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer 
another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply 
their name as soon as possible. 

Please call with any questions.",Non Abusive

can go to luminant.com.  Hit login (upper right corner) and go to userid

the logos.  We selected the first one  in row A.

week.  I will be working in Chicago Monday and Tuesday next week.  I will be

Todd tells me that a logo has been selected.  Can you e:mail that to me?  If 
not available electronically, I will see it when I am back in the office next 
Wednesday.   

If no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process 
and opportunities that may be presented there, I will do that when I am back 
in the office next week.  My first move will be to sit down with Jeff 
Sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours 
that James Scribner sent you.  When we look at numbers of confirmations and 
compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which 
activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed  
to absorb increased business more easily.  I also think that Jeff will be the 
best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to 
simply life at excelr and perhaps create value externally.  All of the 
advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system, 
auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm 
group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for 
implementation.  No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next.

At 8:30 AM Tuesday the 25th, we did our first trade, a 42# linerboard trade 
(the outside part of a cardboard box) with Con Agra (13,500 tons and about 
$6,000,000 notional).  We hope to do another trade today with Irving as well.

I am sure we will have a new list of bugs at the end of today but I think we 
are past the major issues.

Going forward (next two to three weeks), we will be working to get the 
product offering from its current 21 financial to about 50 financial as well 
as adding in physical at Rotterdam.  We will also be ready to handle any 
newsprint from Garden State at the end of August.  We also have some text 
changes and minor programming related to  wording on the site that is new or 
unclear to the industry.

We will continue to push for registration (currently at 12 who now have user 
ID, password and made it through credit, legal, tax).

The markets load in about 4 seconds now so we fixed the slowness issue.

We will also start generating a report each day on stats that are relevant.

I will try to get some read only IDs for people but give me a little time to 
get this done.  I want my tech people sitting with the traders this week 
showing them the system and making sure everything is working. They also need 
to go back through what they did the last month and make sure they clean up 
some steps.

We will work on a press release to maybe go out mid to late August to 
coincide with a larger customer mailing, a few adds in industry publications, 
physical product and a complete suite of financial products. 

I would like to thank everyone who helped us get to this launched 
successfully.  However, we all realize this is a beginning, not an ending, 
and that there is a significant amount of work still ahead.

To all

Tim has delivered the initial microsoft project plan for the MO integration - 
this is available to all via the integration project 'office' - i.e. Richard 
and Phil.

I summarise the key themes as :-

summary operational risk assessment across all MG entities and functional 
groups ( as defined within the DPR )
defining MO organisational structure and fit with excelr's control model - 
particularly logistics and co-ordination
interaction with Fin Ops processes
month end consolidation process
SAP implementation
working capital and revenue forecasting
interaction with RAC re VAR / trading limits ( market and credit )
awaiting notice of trading limits
credit counterparty review and set up within GCP
VAR methodology implementation
interaction with IT re systems development/maintenance
AS 400 development timetable and roll out to NY for WANG replacement
MITS/EOL migration
Use of Enlighten in application architecture
defined IT resource requirement
interaction with Legal re excelr Metals name change and related documentation 
issues
MO integration planning for settlements and trade accounting

The focus and objectives relating to the above for this week are as follows :-

review of London processes and define boundaries for segregation of duties 
implementation ( Action TPP ) - also discuss extension to NY ( SWilson )
review of Wolff activities in Germany ( Action KR/AC )
continuing review of new recycling yards ( project Cook ) in Germany ( Action 
AH/RJ )
review interdependencies between MO/Fin Ops/RAC/Systems integration plans ( 
Action MJ/RS )
document current assessment of operational risk with particular emphasis on 
Wolff and Recycling businesses ( Action MJ with KR/AC/AH/RJ/TPP/SW )
Brainstorm month end accounting close and potential earnings election for 
consolidation ( Action  TPP/MJ/BA/SWood )

I know that Tim Jones is from MG, so he will be found in the ECT Europe 
External Address Book. In order to address him, I create a reply or new 
message and then click on the Address button. Change the address book from 
ECT or excelr to the ECT External Address Book:



At this point I need to skip down to the Jones' in the list, so I just type 
jones and a Quick Search dialogue box appears. Click OK and I go to the first 
of the Jones' llisted in this address book (Allan I think). It's a reasonably 
long list, but only one exists.



He's Tim R Jones, so I click on the 'To:' button to add him to the recipient

Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled 
and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning 
Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the 
same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is 
apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to 
cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as 
soon as I know a rescheduled date.  

In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with 
most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, 
accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a 
meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to 
accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have 
provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as 
copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  

With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of 
your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance 
specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to 
me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please 
e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you 
have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name

Here is a rough draft of my notes from our visit yesterday.
Please read and see if it accurately reflects the essence of what you want to 
communicate.

My suggestion is that you take the time early one evening and maybe visit 
with Brent off site. Maybe over a
cocktail.  I'm sure you will be both serious and concerned

What you are doing is giving Brent his year end review and basically asking 
him to fill in the details with
actions over the next four to five months.

1) Brent has a great opportunity to take his leadership skills to the next 
level and by focusing and delivering
these challenges he will solidify his core strengths in the eyes of others 
and most importantly himself.

2)  You need for him to step up to the plate and fully support you by 
insuring that he will ""take care of the
business, completely and totally.""  No hits to the P & L,  zero tolerance for 
incompetency and complacency.

You can not do what you need to do Globally without the trust and confidence 
in his performance

Additionally he must identify and develop his successor.

Get a covenant from Brent that his is fully committed to do the work

Also let him know you fully support him and will continue to back him fully 
in this effort as long as he does his
part and keeps you informed.

Call me if needed.

Subject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1  

Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark 
Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right 
thing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the 
service to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as 
soon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs 
regularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider 
the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary 
when you meet with Mark.

First, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial 
confirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that 
time, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  
We now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in 
Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  

Second, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by 
Houston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep 
audit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent 
out after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are 
periodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in 
the confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the 
confirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the 
confirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big 
problem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, 
which is even a bigger problem.  

Third, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston 
generate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the 
transactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the 
confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by 
legal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if 
done by excelr Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the excelr Entity is excelr 
North America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the 
counterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of 
execution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the 
follow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary 
office.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same 
pre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where 
there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, 
or, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare 
our own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element 
of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are 
we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?

Fourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in 
Houston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has 
staff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are 
reviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, 
route them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is 
complete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on 
issues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading 
company financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the 
transactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these 
documents.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for 
the financial confirmations without adding any staff.

Fifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the 
confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  
Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the 
confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the 
transaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the 
financial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for excelr.

Finally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my 
existing employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the 
company in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of 
the documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas 
such as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to 
keep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the 
confirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already 
exists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full 
accountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity 
to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.

As a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring 
that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function 
properly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to 
get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this 
function to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the 
impression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I 
hope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to 
look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that 
exists here.

If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in 
this memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very 
strongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please 
let me know how your meeting with Mark goes.

Thanks,
Peggy

Just so that you are aware, we continue to have problems with the financial 
confirm process from Houston.  On more than one occasion, confirmations have 
been sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary.  Attached is the 
most recent one.   We have been assured over and over that this will not 
happen again, however, it continues to happen.  Luckily, this confirmation 
went out without any errors in it.  I know that you are very busy, but  is 
there any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the 
financial confirmations to Calgary.

Sally, 
I'm sorry I left you off my original note but I wanted you to know......

...the third time is a charm.  After 2 failed adoptions, God has blessed me 
with a beautiful daughter!  Emily Lyn was born on Saturday, July 8 at 11:18 
am in San Antonio.  She weighed 7 lbs. and measured 19 inches.  She is so 
tiny and has a head full of dark hair!  I brought her home last night at 8:30 
pm.  Our first 
night went well even if I didn't get any sleep.  It's going to take some time 
for me to get used to the noises she makes.  I must admit, there were
days when I never thought this would happen.  I appreciate all the kind words 
of encouragement many of you have shared over the last few years
as I have gone through this process, especially during the really low 
points.  I am truly blessed.
I will be out of the office for a while but feel free to stay in touch as I'm 
sure I'll be logging in often.  Also, if I left someone off the list here, 
please have them forgive me.  Remember, I'm working on 0 sleep.  Please feel 
free to pass this along to anyone I may have fogotten.  Thanks.

Per your request, here is a copy of my resume.  The information is updated 
through my role in investor relations which accounts for the review period.  
I also provided your assistant with a summarized list of my projects for the 
period and have attached that as well for you.  

Thanks and I look forward to visiting with you soon.

25666,beck-s/all_documents/1795.,<5271946.1075855788331.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark 
Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right 
thing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the 
service to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as 
soon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs 
regularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider 
the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary 
when you meet with Mark.

First, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial 
confirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that 
time, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  
We now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in 
Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  

Second, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by 
Houston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep 
audit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent 
out after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are 
periodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in 
the confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the 
confirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the 
confirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big 
problem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, 
which is even a bigger problem.  

Third, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston 
generate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the 
transactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the 
confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by 
legal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if 
done by excelr Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the excelr Entity is excelr 
North America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the 
counterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of 
execution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the 
follow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary 
office.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same 
pre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where 
there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, 
or, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare 
our own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element 
of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are 
we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?

Fourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in 
Houston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has 
staff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are 
reviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, 
route them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is 
complete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on 
issues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading 
company financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the 
transactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these 
documents.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for 
the financial confirmations without adding any staff.

Fifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the 
confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  
Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the 
confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the 
transaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the 
financial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for excelr.

Finally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my 
existing employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the 
company in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of 
the documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas 
such as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to 
keep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the 
confirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already 
exists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full 
accountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity 
to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.

As a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring 
that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function 
properly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to 
get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this 
function to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the 
impression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I 
hope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to 
look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that 
exists here.

If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in 
this memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very 
strongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please 
let me know how your meeting with Mark goes.

Thanks,
Peggy

		 Subject: Associates PRC Meeting - To Be Rescheduled

Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled 
and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning 
Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the 
same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is 
apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to 
cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as 
soon as I know a rescheduled date.  

In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with 
most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, 
accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a 
meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to 
accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have 
provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as 
copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  

With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of 
your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance 
specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to 
me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please 
e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you 
have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name 
and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in 
Houston.  My extension is 35926.

Peggy,

As far as I can tell, we simply screwed up on this deal.  Diane Anderson, who 
was covering for Angie last week, was using my name to sign off on some other 
Canada deals which were approved from last week then signed and sent this one 
by mistake.  We're terribly sorry for the mistake.  Call me if you want to

are settling into a routine and she sleeps about 4 hours at a time so it 
gives me time to get a fair amount of rest.  We'll probably make a trip down 
to the EB in a few weeks and I'll be sure to let you know exactly when.  I

Subject: MG Middle Office Integration : Fortnightly Newsletter

Hi,

As you will have seen today in     an announcement is to be made on the 
London Stock Exchange this afternoon stating we have gone wholly 
unconditional on our offer to acquire MG plc.

Though the accounting consolidation date will be the end of the month, we 
will effectively ""own"" the trading positions as of close of business 
yesterday (if anyone wants clarification on the distinction between these two 
dates please call). Therefore, as far as possible we need to have a 
recognisable ""middle office"" in place to ensure transparency of trading 
positions and results, efficient and controlled operational processes, 
segregation of duties; in a nutshell, no accidents!

So, where are we...

1) Last Week ...

Valuation Review - Andy Cornfield and I completed a detailed review of 
trading positions and associated valuations to ensure that from cob 
yesterday, all positions were correctly valued in line with excelr's valuation 
methodology.

SAP - Wayne Andrews (Project Apollo Director) was over from Houston to 
kick-off the ""MG migration to SAP"" project. Michael Heap will be leading this 
project from London with a focus on establishing a project plan over the next 
few weeks.

Remote Offices -  MG have offices all over the world and it is important to 
distinguish between ""trading"" offices, that are permitted to ""commit"" the 
firm, and origination and representative offices that service the ""trading"" 
offices. excelr staff have been visiting all of MG's offices over the past few 
weeks so we can ensure that appropriate controls are established around the 
different types of office. 

2) This Week

DPR -  yesterday Sheila Foo produced a DPR for the entire MG operation, 
sub-divided into five distinct business units for onward reporting to excelr 
and MG senior management. Mary Thambiah will be consolidating the results 
with those of excelr Europe from cob today - the first day we ""own"" MG's 
trading results.

Doorstep and Process Review - a ""Doorstep"" controls review was performed by 
Brent Price two weeks ago, and provisional findings noted. However, a deal 
test is still outstanding and we are inviting AA back to this week to 
complete it. We are also asking AA to document work flow and systems 
processes so we have a better understanding of the integration points as we 
move the MG business on to the excelr Middle Office model.

3) Lastly, attention model train enthusiasts...

MG have about eight meters of LGB standard gauge track, a couple of 
locomotives and an array of rolling stock - problem is that the network fell 
over a couple of weeks ago (I blame it on Gerald Corbett!). Are there any 
model train enthusiasts out there prepared to give up some of there time to 
fix it? Any offers for help will be accepted on a confidential basis - 
anonymity assured!!

Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions on any of the above x 
34264.

Regards,
Tim

here, I don't know if we will get a chance to actually talk to each other 
today (especially since it is your first day back in the office), so I want 
to give you the details in case you get a call from Louise.

I know you and I talked about the trip, and that the entire team was going to 
go to London for team building in smaller groups of 4-5 people.  I did not 
think it right that everyone in the group go and Cecilia not be included.  
There is a business reason for her to be here, as she is working on the PCG 
Operations Manual (it is very outdated and needs revising).  The team in 
Houston has made edits, so she will be editing and reviewing the doc with the 
London team for their changes while we are here.  

I was also told that it was excelr policy that employees fly business class on 
International flights.  Louise stated that Sheriff does not want people 
flying business class, but I was not aware of this.  For future trips, 
everyone will fly coach.  I also have Cecilia rooming with Melba to save 
costs on the trip, and others will do the same on future trips if necessary. 

I told Dave about a month ago that we were going at this time, which he does 
not remember...Dave made the comment to me that he feels like he is more 
aware of what is going on in London than in Houston and that he and Amita 
spend at least an hour or two on the phone each day, and that maybe I need to 
report to him instead of you.  I really do not have time to spend 2 hours out 
of my day updating him on every little thing that the group does.  I do make 
him aware of issue/questions, but I think this is overkill.  I told him it 
does make sense for me to report to you b/c we support ongoing operations of 
excelrOnline and are closely linked to the groups that fall beneath your 
organization.

As you can see, I am a little more than frustrated with all this.  I have set 
up weekly meeting with Forester going forward, but I really feel like I 
should be able to run the group without doing much more than this.  My 
decision making should be trusted and I think it has been proven in the 
past.  Even when I do ask Dave questions and we try to get information from 
him, he is slow to respond b/c he is so involved in so many things and he 
becomes a bottleneck of sorts.  I do not want my job to become the person 
that just tells Dave what my group is doing.  If they (Dave and Louise) do 
not feel like I am capable of running the group or doing a good job, I really 
would like to know....

If you do get a chance to call me, please do.  I can be reached at 83035378 
here in London.  I tried to send most of this via e-mail b/c I am in the 
middle of everyone here and don't know how much I will be able to talk.

Since we may not be able to have our bi-weekly meeting, I thought I'd let you 
know what's going on:

DPR
I'm working with London to determine how to report the MG DPR to us.  Nothing 
has been decided yet as we are waiting on the risk management policies & risk 
limits from our guys in London.
As you know, plenty of V@R questions have been coming our way, and are 
somewhat difficult for Mike's team to answer.  I talked with Eugenio and he 
is in the process of putting together some V@R analytics/graphs Mike's guys 
can easily create to answer simpler V@R questions.
Burton, a book analyst in Brent's group is coming back to Mike's DPR group to 
support Gary Stadler and work on the benchmark reports and curve 
validations.  Jenifer Bagwell has taken Burton's place in Brent's group.

A while back, Eugenio created a database to capture information and allows 
book & commodity analysis.  He has been showing this to Business Unit 
controllers & the RAC group, but has not distributed it yet, due to security 
issues.  Currently, the database does not restrict different users to 
different commodities (power people can see gas and vice versa).  It will 
slow down the database considerably if these restrictions are put in, but it 
may be necessary.  I think the business controllers would not share the 
information with commercial, but I'm not sure about the analysts in the RAC 
group.  I'd like to get your opinion on this.

Doorstep
I've updated the presentation to include places and planned visits for 
offices previously not visited and second offices visits for the next year
Donna, Ted, Richard L. and I have a meeting scheduled to go over the follow 
up of the first visits - I'll update you after the meeting.

Hope you had a good vacation!

Subject: Update - ENA Confirmation Delivery System

We may finally have some good news for a change.  Mark Taylor with ENA Legal 
said yesterday 
that the law signed by President Clinton in June regarding electronic 
signatures should allow us to
eliminate confirmations for excelr OnLine transactions.  The law, in short, 
gives electronic signatures
the legal weight of paper signatures and goes into effect October 1, 2000.

Until we receive final approval, we will have to simply hope and pray that 
this becomes reality.  However, 
even if this becomes reality, we will continue to have Counterparties that 
will require confirmations such 
as the public utilities.

I will keep you updated.

that point, I wanted to recap my understanding of the next steps.  Ed 
Gottlob, Melissa Graves, Rita Wynne and Clem Cernosek will work together to 
pull data to view HPLC's total transport business, and then balance it to the 
off-system interconnect business used in the Texas Trading Operation.  This 
perspective, when all elements are accounted for and tied out, should result 
in the accounting UA4 numbers recorded each month in our general ledger.  
They will focus as the core team, and will enlist others as needed which 
might include Gas Accounting, Settlements (Lisa Csikos) or others.  
Additionally, Johnnie has offered assistance from her team, but feels the 
project of tieing the data best resides in Energy Operations.  They will need 
to determine their course of action, and schedule a follow-up meeting with 
the group when they have some data to share.

I want to reiterate:  We all understand the importance of this project and 
will do everything possible to support it.  These 4 people will remove 
themselves from their daily activities to concentrate on this full-time.  We 
felt a dedicated group would deliver the desired results more effectively 
rather than individuals balancing other responsiblities.  It is crucial that 
everyone take ownership in the results.

in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of 
events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include 
customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this 
memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the 
threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to 
$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and 
events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer 
events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events 
with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public 
Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman

2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract 
negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department 
will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they 
can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department 
will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program 
and ENA.

3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting 
documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a 
detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please 
submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR 
department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the 
form.

4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of 
the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for 
various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance 
planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie 
Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

As you know, we will be hosting staff from MG tomorrow evening and on 
Wednesday and Thursday evening for a presentation/overview on excelr and a 
tour of excelr House.  The MG Staff have not been selected by department for 
these events, but rather have been given the option to sign up on a 
first-come, first-serve basis.  I anticipate having approximately 35 people 
on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday and 35 on Thursday.  The members of MG's 
management who joined us on the 8th of June are not attending this week in 
order to provide their colleagues with an opportunity to visit the building 
(hence the smaller numbers).

The purpose of these events is to help MG staff get better acquainted with 
excelr and to see first-hand where they will be relocating to in September.  
To this end, I would like to invite all of you to attend at least one of 
three events with a view to being on hand to act as a host/hostess, 
potentially join tours of the building and to be on hand to field any 
specific questions which may come up about your respective departments.  I 
hope this will also prove to be a good opportunity for you to meet MG staff 
on a more informal basis.  

The schedule of events each night will be as follows: 

17:45 - 18:00  MG Staff Arrive at excelr House

18:00 - 18:05  Welcome and Introductions:  Eric Gadd

18:05 - 18:15  excelr Video

18:15 - 18:40  Presentation on excelr and excelr Europe: Mark Schroeder 
(Tuesday)
         Fernley Dyson (Wednesday)
         John Thompson (Thursday)

18:40 - 19:30   Tours of excelr House/Drinks & Canap,s

19:30 - 19:45  Depart for Home by Bus to Liverpool Street Station [or 
Directly from excelr House]


I know that many of you have been keen to participate in this kind of 
informal event with our new colleagues at MG, so I hope you will be able to 
join us.   So that we can get a feel for numbers, I would appreciate it if 
you could RSVP to me by 2:00 p.m. tomorrow regarding your participation for 
all three events.  Please note that due to a number of excelr staff 
participating in the Chase Corporate Challenge on Wednesday evening, I am

All VP's are strongly encouraged to complete this course.  It is a 2 or 3 day

Director level are final.  You and your management team can begin the process 
of giving performance reviews to your employees.  I spoke with Sheila Walton 
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting 
the employee reviews.  She indicated that the target completion date should 
be the end of July.  

Promotions will be effective August 1st.  It is Dave Delainey's intent to 
announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24.  
This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.   I do not 
yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single 
memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.  I will keep you 
updated on this as I get direction from him.  

Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.  In 
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review 
process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when 
conducting their reviews.   It is very important for all of us to be 
consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups 
who will be giving performance reviews.  It is important to note, however, 
that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view 
of that employee's relative ranking.  In other words, an employee in the 
Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that 
the employee is doing a great job.   Clearly, a large number of employees 
performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory 
category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas 
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in 
the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc.  

Also please note the following: 

Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or 
Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given 
to the employees.  This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with 
the relative performance of that employee.  (This has been the stated process 
for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process 
as well.)
Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team, 
yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced 
members of your management team, or those management team members where you 
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and 
perhaps tough performance feedback.  I believe that we have spent some time 
in identifying these situations.  I ask your help to ensure that we follow 
through on this commitment.  

Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a 
meaningful one.

Subject: Strategic Systems Plan

Greetings Sally!  During the next week and a half, we will begin the process 
of collecting information which will be used to write the Strategic Systems 
Plan.  Basically, the Strategic Systems Plan will be used to identify several 
areas of opportunity within each business unit such as:

Each business units overview and the role technology plays in their area
Current trends in each business area
Using technology to help you achieve corporate goals/objectives
Current departmental/business unit goals
Using technology help you achieve departmental goals/objectives
Projected business growth in twelve (12) to eighteen (18) months?
Current technology being used
Mission critical applications
IT resources which are available
Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) 
Do you have any technology projects underway?
Current projects
Top 3 priorities
How are IT projects and/or computer requests tracked 
Desired/Future Projects
Issues/Concerns

The following process will be used to accomplish this:

A cover letter with a questionnaire explaining what we wish to accomplish and 
the process will be emailed to each of your direct reports
An interview will be set up with each direct report.  Each meeting will be 
scheduled for approximately 45 minutes.
Results of the questionnaire and interview will be used to create a draft 
report
The draft report will be distributed for comments
A final report with recommendations will be written and distributed.

I hope this process meets with your approval.  I can be reached at 58841.

Thank You!

As on Day 1 we ran the UNIFY to SAP interface at 8:00 AM, Noon, and 3:00 PM. 
Set out below are the results of these runs.

The interfaces for excelr North America (financial for gas, weather, and pulp 
and paper) were error free.
The interfaces for ENA Global Products--Financial resulted in two invoices 
not being accepted by SAP. This was due to a SAP error that has occurred 
about three times in test. However, the SAP team cannot duplicate the error 
in order to correct. They are still trying to find the root of this problem. 
The two transactions which were not picked up by SAP were resent successfully.
The interfaces for ENA FX Financial uncovered a breakdown in the process. The 
payment program for this entity is to be processed manually by the Accounts 
Payable Dept. For July 5 and today, the AP Dept. forgot to process the 
payment program resulting in nine payments (7 US $, 1 Canadian, and 1 GBP) 
not  being paid. We were able to get all payments out today through SAP 
except the GBP payment. The GBP non-payment was discovered by a counterparty 
calling and stating that they did not received their funds. The US$ and 
Canadian non-payments were discovered when we reviewed our bank statements 
and found that the funds were not disbursed. For future interfaces, Bernard 
is to call Treasury after each interface is processed to ensure that the 
payments for this entity were received by them.

Guys,
This Enpower calc issue is a joke.   How can we be the most Innovative 
Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem.  
Furthermore, how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our 
power transactions when our back office (risk books, position management, 
settlements) is so unreliable from an IT standpoint.

In addition, we will start losing all of our key people in this area because 
they are here until 8:30-9:00 every night and 4:00 pm on ""holidays"".  This 
whole issue is a significant business risk for excelr and needs to be dealt 
with accordingly.

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the 
power port calc.  The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the 
message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months 
now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday 
(excelr holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and 
should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six 
times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by 
4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a 
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders 
by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact on 
our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution 
of this problem.
Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower 
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.  
I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing 
business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the 
agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense 
or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to 
another server.
Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

Subject: athena vs quark

With regards to the message below, we must have athena (server) to run our 
nightly risk books for the power group.  We run one of our three east power 
calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solution 
for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken 
away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We 
usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5 
hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful 
completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building 
when the calc crashes at 4:30.
Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the 
last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable.
We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our 
system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense 
of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden 
today about these problems. 
I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted 
with the finger pointing between different IT groups.

 Reconciliation and Cash Management of Futures account done by Sydney

 By the end of the month, Enpower data will be mechanically extracted to

Hi Sally and Mike,

Talked to Lexi Elliott and she told me about you all having lunch with
Blake, Clay and Michelle the other day. I know that meant alot to them and
only solidified their desire to work for excelr. Thanks for taking time out
of your busy schedules to meet with them.

Just wanted to let you know that I am scheduled to meet with Lexi and
Shelly Jones on Wednesday, August 2nd at 11:00 a.m. We will then be going to
lunch. Would like for both of you to join us if possible. I will bringing
Brenda Peters, who is with OU Career Services, down with me. She wanted to
come down with me and see excelr and meet both Lexi and Shelly, especially
Lexi, since she is the new OU contact for excelr. Brenda wants to make sure
everything is on schedule for this Fall recruiting. Lexi will be coming to
OU in early August to tour the campus and I will introduce her to Tim Rasnic
(JC Penney Leadership Program Director) and Dean Evans along with other
Department Heads in the Price College of Business. That way she should feel
comfortable when excelr comes to campus in October. If you are available and
would like to join us why don't you either let me know or else have your
assistants contact Lexi and let her know. If you would like to suggest a
time and place to meet, please feel free to do so.

If you can't make lunch and need to visit with me about anything, let me
know and I will arrange my schedule to meet with you. I will be in Houston
that entire week making my rounds.

Hope your summers have been going well and have been able to spend time with
your families.

Look forward to hopefully having lunch on August 2nd.

Take care.

Daily) has been running a series of articles about the new century.  Several 
of these have focused on the power industry in the U.S.  A friend of mine ran 
across one on excelr that was published on April 13 and sent it to me.  I 
thought you would find it interesting.

The article focuses on EES in particular and about how we try to succeed by 
being first to meet our clients' changing needs.  It also describes how we 
use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive.  
The article also briefly mentions the new office in Japan.

The most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is 
about excelr.  Given what I have read and heard about how nervous the Japanese 
are about deregulation of the industry, I really did not expect such praise.

Denki Shimbun also has a web site at ""www.shimbun.denki.or.jp"".  They have 
small summaries of the important articles of the day (the site, however, is 
completely in Japanese).  Another interesting site is 
""www.criepi.denken.or.jp"", the English home site of Japan's Central Research

We interfaced UNIFY to SAP three times today. Interface number one (8:40 AM) 
was error free. The second interface (Noon) created duplicate invoices for 
those sent in our first interface. The problem that caused the duplication 
was that the flag in UNIFY that prevents invoices from being sent to SAP 
after they have already been interfaced did not work. The problem was 
corrected before out third interface at 3:15 PM. In the 3:15 interface, one 
error occurred --- a counterparty was set up in Global as intercompany that 
should be third party. This error will be corrected before our next interface 
on 7/6 AM.

Overall, I was pleased at how well the interfaces worked today and how fast 
the SAP and UNIFY teams responded to our issues.

On Friday June 30th, Unify's production performance was impacted by a large 
volume (30k) of replication/ configuration transactions from SAP.
The mass update from SAP to Global/ Unify effected excelr's business 
throughout the afternoon, causing contract replication to be delayed, and 
missed nominations.

Corrective actions taken to ensure this does not occur again:
Global Replication - Move the SAP to Global/ Unify replication for 
Intercompany from hourly to a nightly (1:00 am) process.  As we could miss 
new data setup dependencies, the volume is expected to be reduced.
SAP Support - SAP IT support will notify Global systems of any scheduled 
'rebuilds'/ mass updates to monitor/ move the schedule during an off-peak 
time.

power port calc.  The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the 
message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months 
now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday 
(excelr holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and 
should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six 
times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by 
4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a 
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders 
by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact on 
our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution 
of this problem.
Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower 
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.  
I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing 
business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the 
agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense 
or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to 
another server.
Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

Subject: athena vs quark

With regards to the message below, we must have athena (server) to run our 
nightly risk books for the power group.  We run one of our three east power 
calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solution 
for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken 
away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We 
usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5 
hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful 
completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building 
when the calc crashes at 4:30.
Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the 
last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable.
We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our 
system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense 
of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden 
today about these problems. 
I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted 
with the finger pointing between different IT groups.
Thanks.

see below.

Greg Whiting will call ENA whenever he enters more than a specified number of 
changes in the SAP T880 table. He will transition this procedure to the SAP 
COE.  What is the threshold that Global needs to be notified?  Who in Global 
should be notified?

To clarify, the verification is manual & is subject to human error, such as 
someone forgets or is on vacation.  If a large file is sent without 
notification during the day, the impact is significant.  I think moving the 
job to run in the evening will virtually eliminate the potential for this 
problem to occur again.  However, to eliminate the risk completely I suggest 
that the verification be automated.  You said that you'll have the ability to 
do this in global in a few months.  If you can't do it, then we (SAP) need to 
write an automated monitoring program.

Subject: SAP / Global/ Unify replication problem on Friday June 30th


On Friday June 30th, Unify's production performance was impacted by a large 
volume (30k) of replication/ configuration transactions from SAP.
The mass update from SAP to Global/ Unify effected excelr's business 
throughout the afternoon, causing contract replication to be delayed, and 
missed nominations.

Corrective actions taken to ensure this does not occur again:
Global Replication - Move the SAP to Global/ Unify replication for 
Intercompany from hourly to a nightly (1:00 am) process.  As we could miss 
new data setup dependencies, the volume is expected to be reduced.
SAP Support - SAP IT support will notify Global systems of any scheduled 
'rebuilds'/ mass updates to monitor/ move the schedule during an off-peak 
time.

change to the legal entity we'll use for the ""trading"" portion of

   As long as our business model is a one to many model the decision is......
a. For Click Match activity Clickpaper.com can still be used as planned.  
Simply, we'll only be invoicing for transaction fees.
b. For Click Trade activity the following will happen.
 1.  Physical trading that occurs at any North American Hub developed by 
Clickpaper.com, excelr North America, Corp. (ENA) will be the        
confirming entity.  I  have asked legal to develop a simple recital statement 
for the physical confirmation to indicate that the transaction originated as 
a         ""Clickpaper.com on-line transaction"".   
 2.  Physical trading that occurs at any Hub developed for the U.K., Latin 
America, or Asia, has not yet been finalized for legal entity purposes.  My 
desire is       that we follow the legal entity structure used by EOL on-line 
trading for Hubs in similar countries.  We'll work that out soon.

Strictly from an operational point of view the benefits are many but the most 
significant is a much simplified mid/back-office effort in order to support 
Clickpaper on-line business.  We no longer need to be concerned about setting 
up more portfolio/book i.d.'s for risk books as on-line deals can go into the 
same risk books used today for pulp and paper.  Intercompany transactions 
between Clickpaper.com and ENA are now eliminated for on-line trades which 
simplifies the confirmation support as well as the downstream financial 
reporting/reconcilation activity that would be required by using 
Clickpaper.com as the entity.  

If our one to many model is successful, we move to a many to many model.  At 
that point, all of this changes.  So for now, ENJOY!

Subject: SAP and Seller Rules!!!! Please read

All,

July 1, SAP goes into effect for us here in Houston.  Also, the seller rules 
principle comes into play.  This means that if we (the IR/FX desk) owe you a 
payment in USD, GBP or EUR, you MUST book the payable in SAP to company 0967 
(we are no longer company 1Y3).  We then go into SAP and remove the block and 
that allows the payment to be sent.  

Per Corp., all intercompany trades are to be handled in this  manner.  This 
means that when you are paying us any of the 3 above currencies, we will go 
into SAP and book a payable to your company.  Going forward, when confirming 
settlements with Ana, you must be prepared to provide her with your company 
number.  You are then responsible for going into SAP and removing the block 
to allow payments to be released.  

Is SIFT UK interfacing directly to SAP, or will you manually be booking these 
entries?  If you are interfacing, the payable entry should automatically be 
created.  If you are  manually booking into SAP, you will need to coordinate 
with your accounting/reporting contacts to make sure that all of this goes 
smoothly.  If you are not the person who will be manually booking the entries 
into SAP, please forward this message to the appropriate person.

Hi Sally!

Thank you for your revisions.  They have been incorporated and the article is 
ready to go!  The Spring 2000 issue is the only one that did not have a 
profile.  I'm sorry that I didn't bring one of the other issues with me, but 
the Summer 2000 issue is set for distribution in July and it has several

Yes, we do need a photo of you for your article.  Do you have a current 
high-resolution photo, slide or negative that we could borrow?  Please let me

Operating Risk within each business and the region as a whole. Consequently 
it would be complimentary to the BRM process.



I hope to complete an efficient/judgemental assessment internally for all

be to establish that the currrent action plans for Systems Development and

a traffic light scale ie

Green inherent risk less processes/controls gives a residual operational risk 
which is accpetable

International Global Products, a new Coordination team is being created in

to Chris Mahoney.

The Coordination function has been set up by Cindy Horn, who will be handing

by the London and Helsinki offices, and the further processing of this

The Coordination function for Houston and Panama City will be headed by

quarter.

A similar rationalisation of roles in the Far Eastern offices will be

on the integration of the MG metals business and a large number of fluid 
teams working on different aspects of the project; however, most issues 
related to the integration process will only be of interest to a subset of 
the people involved.

We currently have two main forums for information sharing available to 
members of the integration team:

The weekly newsletter produced by Fiona Grant in PR, which from 30 June 
onwards will be sent to EEL management and the heads of those departments 
represented on the Integration Team.
A weekly meeting on Friday mornings from 8am to 9am in NW1006, which has been 
put in place to provide team leaders with an opportunity to update the entire 
integration team on their top two or three issues for the past and/or coming 
week.  

For now, I expect the weekly update and the weekly meetings to meet the 
information needs of the integration team.  If you feel this is not adequate, 
then let either myself or Fiona Grant know and we'll do a re-think on the 
subject.

To this end, and in the interests of ensuring that we conclude our discussion 
in the allotted time, the following are a few organisational points I would 
like everyone to bear in mind when attending the Friday morning meeting:

Attendees should distinguish between presenters and audience at the weekly 
meeting. 
Presenters should attend if at all possible and, in the event they are unable 
to attend, should nominate a replacement for the meeting (replacements should 
be notified to Esther Gerratt in advance of the  Friday morning meeting if 
possible).

For the time being, presenters and their designated areas are:

- Eric Gadd  Commercial and Acquisition progress
- Amita Gosalia  EOL
- Justin Boyd  Legal
- Toby Knight  Premises
- Barry Sangster  IT infrastructure
- Bob Campbell  IT applications
- Richard Sage  Middle and Back Offices and Project Management
- Lloyd Fleming  RAC
- Tim Davies  Credit
- Anne Edgley  Finance
- Anne Hicks  Cash Management
- Janine Juggins  Tax
- Andrea Kerch  US GAAP and Due diligence
- Nigel Sellens  HR
- Fiona Grant  PR
- Bruce Garner  Business Development 
 
As  this is intended to be an ""update""-only meeting, any unresolved 
substantive issues are to be taken off-line and the resolution reported the 
following week. 
Lastly, I would request that presenters focus on communicating, in an 
efficient manner, things which affect other functions within the integration 
process.  Doing so will assit other presenters in relaying the information 
presented at the meeting to other personnel in their respective areas.

I hope you find this useful.   We want to keep the information flowing as we 
continue the integration process, but at the same time we need to make sure 
we use our time wisely and efficiently.

Regards,
Eric",Non Abusive

Many thanks for your comments of the draft, I have incorporated these into 
the first version attached below.
As mentioned, this is a 'light' version without all the individual feed 
details and system names etc. intended as an summary for sign-off.
I will tidy up the heavy version so that it can be used to build the

Mike is going to present this to Fernley and to Sally Beck for discussion on 
his trip to Houston next week.
I will send to Beth for her sign off.
We need to consider how to wrap Mark Pickering in and to ensure his support, 
booking EnLighten's place on the IT priority list.

Subject: Unify

Hey Ken,

I just wanted to let you know that the Financial Settlement group were very 
impressed with Unify during the first training class that we had on Friday.  
I did not hear any negative comments, and they even said they liked it better 
than SIFT.  Some of the key areas in which they see great benefit are:

1.  the automatic calculation of in and out of the money options
2.  the statement group assignment screen and the idea of selecting different 
statement groups for different payment terms
3.  the ability to sort and subtotal on financial list screen 
4.  the system is more efficient than SIFT
5.  the ability to view the invoice on screeen and to click directly on the 
line to make adjustments
6.  the ability to wire foreign currencies (really and SAP enhancement)

One thing that I did hear is that they wished they could see excelr North 
America AND ENA Global together on the financial list screen. 

I think the development group did a great job, and I enjoyed working with 
everyone.  I hope that in the next few weeks and months ahead that you will 
continue to allow the team to provide our group with quick and efficient 
response to areas of concern and enhancements.

Thank you to the group for all of your hard work,
Becky

Subject: TAGG modification request

Ron,

A series of significant events took place this week where it made it more 
apparent that a modification in Tagg is highly needed.   Without going into a 
lot of detail regarding the events, the modification desired is simply an 
Expiration Date field for certain types of transactions (Swaptions), where a 
date is keyed by the user at the time the trade is entered into TAGG.  In 
addition, this feature will permit TAGG to prompt the user or users with a 
message box of the Expiration date and associated Deal Number at a later 
time, before the expiration date becomes current (i.e. a week before the 
expiration date becomes current).  

This request carries a lot of value for it allows ENA to avoid a variety of 
risks underlying missing execution of certain types of trades.  This issue 
was addressed in the past and I would like to raise it again.

Can we implement such modification? Your prompt response is highly needed and 
your feedback is appreciated.  

Thanks.

It is too late in the day in London for me to catch you by phone today.  I 
will call you tomorrow and would like to throw out an idea regarding an 
on-going resource for operations in London.  If you are comfortable with my 
idea, then I can discuss it in person with Fernley while he is here this 
week.  We have time on the calendar plus dinner this week.

ENA servers.

As a cautionary move, excelr OnLine was interrupted while the extent of the

Subject: Re: Revised Operating Standards  

Steve

My assessment of the next steps are as follows :-

We finalise the intial draft of the one page summary  - Action Mike/Brent to 
consolidate feedback to date - to be delivered tomorrow
The one pager to be sent to all business heads commenting on John's belief ( 
which I think we all share ) that the Business unit head has ultimate 
responsibility to ensure operating standards are met and that we aim to 
provide them with a joint summary of 'status' from Commercial Support and 
RAC. This summary could be reviewed by AA, but I believe the process would be 
more beneficial if it is 
a self assessment process
escalates judgement on material issues 
capable of being monitored and repeated on an agreed frequency
complimentary to the BRM process
The timeline for thie intial feedback could be within one week - I have an 
assessment from David Port to match to ours already!

As to your other questions

I will be adding two additional detail points within the required structure 
definition - ie the structure must have :-

Full functionality and interfaces for market risk, credit risk and Corporate 
reporting, and/or a systems roadmap for that development
Appropriate involvement in business for specialist services ( Legal, Tax and 
HR )

The Operating Standards MUST only cover one page to retain the ease of 
communication for them - the above definitions identify that businesses must 
consider all Legal and RAC issues - and there will significant detail 
involved in that - which will be defined elsewhere ( see David's separate 
comments on risk reporting )

In summary I think it is best to move to publish the intial draft to 
stimulate communication  - would welcome your thoughts

Mike

 - some changes  -awaiting possible additions from Brent  - if none - to be 
published tomorrow

Subject: Re: Revised Operating Standards  

Mike: 

Is this the most current version of the proposed Operating Standards?  Since 
I've been out of the office since we last discussed, I wanted to get an 
update on the status.  A couple of questions: 

What are the next steps? 
How will this be communicated and to whom?
How do you see this being implemented to best assure it is respected?
Legal Standards are absent?  I suspect this is still in draft form and they 
are to follow in the next version; however, let me know how you see legal 
Standards playing into this as I believe they should be on this list as well.

As discussed, I strongly believe that a brief and clear list of ""absolutes"" 
similar to the attachment will be most useful if first agreed by all that 
need to be involved and then effectively communicated and respected by all in 
EEL.  Let me know if this list is now considered representative of the views 
of all that need to have input.  I suggest we meet again with a broader group 
to assure this list is complete and to discuss next steps.  I have some 
suggested adjustments but will get back to you by end of week with comments 
or questions from RAC after we discuss this in our weekly RAC manager's 
meeting.   

Thanks,

Steve

discussed in the meeting this morning.  

As far as Xref1 (coordinator) and Xref2 (physical vs. financial flag) fields 
go, it appears that we are getting what we have to have in order to go live 
7/1.  Rena was working on a spec (the OSS that was discussed) that would 
automatically populate these 2 fields.  However, the test was unsuccessful.  
These two fields are being opened up for netting, so we can input them 
manually when netting.  I believe we need to pursue the auto fill post 7/1, 
but the first priority is having a place to put the data.

As far as settlement period is concerned, we are probably going to get a 
hybrid of what we want at this time.  The SAP team does appear to have 
appropriate resources working on this issue.  For data created in SAP, I am 
more comfortable that the data is being captured on the income statement side 
of the entry, and the SAP folks now seem to think they can link over to it to 
get the settlement data.  For data converted, we will not be able to get the 
settlement period in the same manner.  The offsetting entry in conversion is 
to a dummy conversion account rather than an income statement account.  The 
dummy account doesn't carry the settlement date.  Another issue is related to 
the indicator to let us know if an invoice has had cash applied or ",Non Abusive

our hands.   Here are some of the facts:

excelr in Houston is closed on both Monday and Tuesday, July 3rd and 4th.  
The NYMEX is closed both days as well.  
Equity markets are closed on Tuesday, July 4th but are open on Monday, July 
3rd.  
excelr Europe is open for business on both days.
Technically, the first work day following the month-end is Wednesday, July 
5th for the Houston office.

Given the facts above, the following will be the month-end process:

QUARTER-END PROCESS:
Final quarter-end information is due to my team by 5 PM on Wednesday, July 
5th.  
No adjustments < $250,000 will be processed after 5 PM on Wednesday.
Adjustments > $250,000 require approval from John Lavorato or John Sherriff.
A final DPR for the quarter ended June 30, 2000 will be issued by 
approximately noon on Thursday, July 6.

JULY DPR REPORTING:
NO DPR will be issued dated July 3, 2000.
For divisions reporting P&L for July 3rd and/or July 4th, a ""Special DPR"" 
will be issued on July 5th.  This ""Special DPR"" will not have a year-to-date 
column.  This is due to the fact that quarter-end information will not be 
completed prior to issuing the ""Special DPR"".    For consolidated DPR 
purposes, July 3rd and July 4th will be combined and reported as one day.  
These combined days will be reported as July 4th.  Please report each of 
these days separately.  Once the final quarter-end DPR is completed, the 
regular DPRs for July business will be updated and reported, replacing any 
""Special DPRs"" previously reported.  This process is necessary to enable 
reporting of current daily information until the final quarter-end DPR is 
finalized.

Piti Guam, and Blackbird), reducing risk,  and only one new one (Motown).

Thanks for the note - coming from JPMorgan I understand the importance of VAR 
as a key control measure and I appreciate that we may all need to do further 
work to 'institutionalise' a VAR culture in excelr. However, in this instance, 
I believe the initial comment has been taken out of context.

I believe there is a general communication issue here. Since inception the 
business has been monitoring risk via the use of a cumulative sensitivity 
measure for the portfolio - expressed and reported as DV01on the daily DPR. 
However, no-one in RAC/Commercial/Commercial Support appears to have formally 
equated that sensitivity to the business VAR limit during the longer than 
expected delay to the completion of a signed off VAR model. ( informally this 
is being done )

I would have expected the business to utilise a crude ( and possibly 
necessarily overstated ) scaling factor based on the volatility of credit 
spread movements in the market and for RAC to have signed off this scaling 
factor. Bryan Seyfield and David Wall will propose this immediately.

Finally, I believe both Commercial and Commercial Support for Credit Trading 
are reprioritising the work being completed for the model for VAR reporting  
- we should communicate the new delivery date as soon as possible.

I look forward to discussing this and other RAC/Commercial Support interface 
issues with you next week

Regards

Mike

Yesterday Debbie and I stepped the P&P group through the Doorstep findings. 
We set the scene, went through the report item by item, and put the findings 
into context, e.g. learning points from Coal.

Collectively, we are comfortable that required actions have been implemented. 

At present the group are on the cusp of transitioning from an origination 
group feeding deals into the Houston risk book, into a fully fledged trading 
unit with physical assets in Europe. Riveria - a potential acquisition of two 
paper mills in Southern France - and/or other acquisitions would be the 
catalyst for this transition.

The group are currently assessing their Commercial, Support and other 
infrastructure resource requirements in order to manage this growth in a 
controlled way. I have sent them the attachment - Roles & Responsibilities

Jordan will be making to MG, and will try to stick close and help them

Question 1)  The investments in CALME and APACHI are booked on an accrual 
basis.  I have had several meetings with Commercial and Accounting   
representatives over the last year and all have stated that any earnings are 
effectively reinvested back into the Assets.  Therefore, the   Market Values 
that are reflected on the MPR are actually Book Values.  The Book Values are 
typically adjusted the last week of the month   and are 1 month behind as the 
Internation groups wait until the GL is closed before communicating the 
updated values.

that these positions are not accounted for on the DPR by India so that we do 
not double-report the P&L.  The long-term solution is to   establish a 
communication line for future investments.  Between Sheila, Donna Lowry, and 
I we can develop a plan.  

Question 3)  The 3 bonds that you are referencing were purchased by Jeff 
Kinneman for Jim Easter.  During our last conversation, Jim told Jeff that 
these   are Strategic investments and should not be reflected on the MPR.


There is still some uncertainty/confusion as to when an investment is 
classified as Merchant.  We could insist that all publically traded 
investments not included in the Equity books would qualify.  Having said 
that, I would like to know if the Gas Authority of India, Ltd (GAIL) and 
Europe's investment in MG are considered to be Merchant investments.

I will be on vacation this Friday and all of next week so please include 
David Maxwell on any responses.  David and I will stay in touch so as to make 
adjustments as needed.

Thanks,
Todd

Mr. Hall,
I have just reviewed the Merchant Portfolio Summary for 6/20 and have the 
following questions:
 1) CALME shows an asset of $291.9MM  and APACHI shows an asset of $113.0MM 
and they show no p&l for the year
  Is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums 
and commodity prices?
 2) India recently invested in an IPO (rediff.com) for which there was a 
simultaneous DASH to buy and sell (sounds like a Merchant deal).
  Where does this show up?
 3) There are several bonds (publicly traded, registrered securities, housed 
in our Prime Broker accounts) owned by various excelr entities
  that I do not believe are on the DPR.  Shouldn't they be? And if so, who is 
deciding not to include?
Pls advise at your earliest convenience as you always do.
Thanks
Ted

I was going to write that the buying and selling of physical commodity 
locally was OK, but that hedging had to be done with Regional Hub. The 
problem with this model is that it describes Helsinki before the bust!

Another possiblity is the agency model, where the local trader acts under the 
direction of the hub trader. This is where Helsinki currently is (although we 
also have an independent manager on site). However, I am not so happy with 
this, and Rick Causey certainly does not like it. Perhaps we should recommend 
independent Risk Managers in every office, but all correspondence and 
settlement with regional hub?

VALUE AT RISK

The Value at Risk (VaR) seminar is designed to introduce participants to this 
important concept.  An understanding of VaR is rapidly becoming an integral 
business need.  The first session of this seminar provides participants with 
a comprehensive review of statistics, these being the primary building block 
of VaR itself.  The program then moves on to identify examples of the context 
in which clients are using VaR in their business decisions.  Participants 
will gain an understanding of the interrelationship of the many factors that 
make VaR a dynamic and strategic tool.  The program ends with a ""hands on"" 
experience of making a simple VaR calculation.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Give a precise definition of Value at Risk
Describe how VaR is changing the way companies evaluate risk in their 
businesses
Discuss how these changing views of risk will impact the use of hedging  
products
Recognize why companies are implementing VaR
Explain the key factors in calculating VaR
Understand the need to categorize risk into ""Risk Buckets""
Define the standardizing practice of Risk Mapping
Illustrate a simple VaR model and accurately discuss the modeling         
process
Calculate a simple two product VaR number
Demonstrate the difference between the Historical, Monte Carlo and Risk 
Metrics  approaches to VaR
Evaluate the impact of correlation on the calculation of VaR
Understand the application and importance of stress testing",Non Abusive

project.  Today, we are making what I hope are final changes to the maps and 
deliverables, with the anticipation that we will deliver to you complete 
binders by Wednesday.  

One issue that we wanted to communicate relates to the use of manual payment 
processes and the risk that processing manual payments presents in the 
automated Unify/SAP environment.  This issue was raised by Melissa during our 
discussion of the manual cash reconciliation effort caused by the inability 
of SAP to auto-match cash receipts and disbursements in situations where the 
money has moved or been received, but the corresponding JE has not been made 
in SAP.  Both Melissa and Cindy Morrow have been involved in subsequent 
discussions related to the below-mentioned risks. 

1.  Risk of JE and payment duplication:

Payments taken directly to Treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in 
Unify:
 In the event that the transaction giving rise to the manual payment is 
entered initially into Unify (which would be the case for all normal 
commodity payments, excluding broker fee and broker margin payment 
transactions), a risk exists that the payment could be recorded and paid 
twice (once by either A/P or Treasury when the manual payment is wired and 
subsequently recorded, and once during the normal Unify to SAP interface).  
Process controls will be put in place to mitigate this risk; however, all 
controls will be people-based, not system-based.  It is too late to rebuild 
the Unify to SAP interface to better address the use of manual payments.  One 
additional suggestion might be to work with each group to reduce the use of 
manual payments except under well-defined, important circumstances.

Payments taken to Treasury, and underlying transaction is recorded directly 
to SAP (does not go through Unify):
If the payment is not entered into SAP with payment method ""J"", A/P will not 
realize that the payment has already been made and will process the 
disbursement a second time.

2.  Risk of understated expense:

Payments taken to Treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in Unify:
For manual payments that are not finalized in Unify (a process performed in 
the system to mark an invoice as final) by month-end (but the disbursement 
has already happened), expense will be understated.

Payments taken to Treasury, and underlying transaction is recorded directly 
to SAP (does not go through Unify):
If payment is not input into SAP by month-end but cash has moved, expense 
will be understated.  (Cash outflow account will show a credit balance which 
will be flipped to A/P, but no income statement entry will be made at that 
time.)

3.  Risk of cash misappropriation:

In addition to the above risks related to the use of manual payments, we also 
believe that a risk exists related to the use of Excel-generated counterparty 
invoices and the lack of segregation between the person responsible for 
preparing these invoices and also for handling/having access to the related 
accounting records.  We believe that it may be possible for a settlements 
coordinator to change the bank routing instructions or bank account number on 
the Excel invoice mailed to the counterparty and then manipulate the 
accounting records during the cash application process to either write off 
the account balance or to reflect the receivable as being paid while 
constantly moving cash application balances from one counterparty to another 
(so that no one account balance ages past an acceptable range).  We have been 
unable to determine a set of control procedures that would mitigate this risk.

4.  Revision to counterparty banking details:

We are currently investigating the procedure performed by Treasury when 
problems with bank account details cause payments to kick-out of Treasury 
workstation.  If the risk of misappropriation exists related to this 
procedure, we will separately communicate.

The above may be unclear.  If so, we would be glad to sit down with you for 
15 minutes or so and clarify.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project.  ",Non Abusive

Thanks for your front-end research on this.  It's too bad that the training 
provider can't be as responsive!  In a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is 
an eternity.  Sounds as if they are inflexible as well.  Our audience for 
this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away 
from the desk is not very workable either.  

After I get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, I may want to 
book them for September, although with a much smaller audience than would be 
desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery.    
Could I get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this 
decision?  Thanks.  --Sally

Sally,
Angela Sprock forwarded your VM to me regarding the VAR training that you 
were looking to set up for your group.

I've taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them 
about the request and their availability. As well as discussing putting on 
the 2 day course solely for you group, I also discussed with them the 
possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter  modules. Although 
they considered this, they are insistent that the course structure, the 
activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format. 
They are a very busy company, in much demand both within excelr and other 
companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September 
21-22.

Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October 
onwards - but that may be less of a fit).

How does this fit with your group?
Let me know if you want to discuss this further

25861,beck-s/all_documents/1972.,<13247333.1075855792661.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"As we discussed in Rick's staff meeting,  you can help your 7/1/00 go-live go 
more smoothly, whether you are implementing financials and HR or HR only.  
Here is one way.

Timekeeping, though it seems mundane on the surface, is a focal point of the 
SAP integration.  Entry and coding of time populates not just payroll, but 
projects and cost centers, real time.  We will now have more flexibility to 
charge employee and contractor time to the areas they actually work (where 
people work on more than one area at a time).  This will only happen to the 
extent that the business and cost center owners drive it.  This capability is 
customizable not just by business unit or company, but by cost center within 
a company.

To make this work HOW YOU WANT IT TO on 7/1, each ""organizational unit"" (as I 
said above, you can drive this in your cost center(s) only or across your BU) 
needs to be clear on questions such as:

1.  Whether or not they want contractors to enter time in SAP
2. Whether you want positive timekeeping (each pay period specifying the cost 
center or projects one worked on) or ""exceptions"" only (e.g., vacation, sick 
time, etc)
3.  Whether an approval process is desired and if so, what it is
4.  Whether people will record their own time using the self service 
capability eHROnline (typically more precise and less handoffs) or whether 
they will continue to use a timekeeper (typically a little more convenient 
for people who (a)  rarely have access to a computer or (b) work in many 
different areas and are not willing/able to identify and use cost center 
numbers or project codes 
5.  Whether people  know the projects and cost center codes they should 
charge to

Your leadership in clarifying this within your cost center and/or BU will be 
instrumental in driviing the level of change you desire, as well as 
minimizing the noise related to the 7/1 go -live.  We have been using a 
variety of methods to communicate and drive much of this change, but the 
business drive for how much to utilize the tool is determined by you.

The deadline for the first SAP time entry period is 3 pm Houston time on 
Friday, June 30.

Despite all our collective efforts, I expect that it will be a few pay 
periods before we get each individual clear on what level of acitivity is 
desired from him by his cost center or company.  Thanks for your help in 
getting through the transition period.  Please call me or Andrea Yowman if 
you have any questions.

provider can't be as responsive!  In a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is 
an eternity.  Sounds as if they are inflexible as well.  Our audience for 
this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away 
from the desk is not very workable either.  

After I get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, I may want to 
book them for September, although with a much smaller audience than would be 
desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery.    
Could I get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this

Sally,
Angela Sprock forwarded your VM to me regarding the VAR training that you 
were looking to set up for your group.

I've taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them 
about the request and their availability. As well as discussing putting on 
the 2 day course solely for you group, I also discussed with them the 
possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter  modules. Although 
they considered this, they are insistent that the course structure, the 
activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format. 
They are a very busy company, in much demand both within excelr and other 
companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September 
21-22.

Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October 
onwards - but that may be less of a fit).

How does this fit with your group?
Let me know if you want to discuss this further

=20
the integration team=01,s accomplishments to date.

What is MG Plc?
MG Plc is a leading, independent international metals trading business, whi=
ch=20
provides a variety of services to the global metals industry. The business=
=20
dates back to 1881 when it was the German Metallgesellschaft Group and was=

active in trading metals from its head office in Frankfurt.  Today, MG is o=
ne=20
of the world=01,s top non-ferrous metals brokers and market makers, the wor=
ld=01,s=20
leading independent copper merchant and a leading merchant of many other=20
non-ferrous metals.

MG is comprised of two core areas of expertise, the Financial Services and=
=20
Merchanting Divisions.  The Financial Services Division was formed in 1970 =
to=20
provide market-making and trading services to the MG=01,s physical metals=
=20
trading business through futures trading as a member of the London Metal=20
Exchange and, at a later date, as a member of COMEX in New York.  In the la=
te=20
1980s, as a result of London=01,s growing leading role in the metals indust=
ry,=20
MG established a merchant trading office in London.  In 1986, MG developed=
=20
its warehousing division with the acquisition of Henry Bath.  In 1999, the=
=20
Merchanting and Financial Services Divisions, including warehousing, were=
=20
combined into a single company, which was floated on the London Stock=20
Exchange.  Currently, MG=01,s core trading offices are located in London an=
d New=20
York with warehouse operations in Liverpool, Humberside, Rotterdam, New=20
Orleans, New Haven, and Singapore. It has merchanting offices in Lima,=20
Santiago, Los Angeles, Chicago, Stockholm, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, New=
=20
Delhi, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo and Melbourne.

What does the Merchanting Division do?
The Merchanting Division is the world=01,s leading independent copper merch=
ant,=20
one of the top three independent merchants of copper concentrates and nicke=
l=20
and one of the leading European merchants of recycled non-ferrous metals. T=
he=20
division also trades in other non-ferrous metals on the London Metals=20
Exchange (LME), including lead, tin, zinc, aluminium and brass.

The Merchanting Division engages in the following main activities:

? Merchanting of Non-ferrous Metals =01) MG trades as a principal with prod=
ucers=20
and consumers, buying and selling non-ferrous metals and concentrates=20
(particularly copper, aluminium and nickel), exchanging qualities and=20
locations and lending and borrowing metals.
? Global Stockholding =01) MG holds stocks of non-ferrous metals at warehou=
ses=20
around the world.
? Merchanting of Recycled Metal =01) MG trades as a principal with supplier=
s and=20
consumers of non-ferrous metal for recycling.
? Terminal Market Operations =01) MG participates in the LME and COMEX usin=
g=20
hedging, arbitrage and position management to support its merchanting=20
activity.

What does the Financial Services Division do?
The Financial Services Division is one of the leading LME members and, base=
d=20
on the volume of LME metals stored, is one of the leading LME metals=20
warehousing businesses.

The Financial Services Division engages in the following main activities:

? Brokerage Activities =01) MG executes orders as a broker for clients in L=
ME=20
and COMEX contracts.
? Market-Making =01) MG is a market-maker for both futures and options cont=
racts=20
and COMEX and OTC contracts.
? Warehousing =01) MG stores metals and other goods in eleven locations in=
=20
Europe, the United States and Asia.

MG has also begun to prepare to trade non-ferrous metals using the internet=
=20
as its platform.  On 10th February, MG announced the formation of a joint=
=20
venture with Internet Capital Group, Inc. and Safeguard International Fund,=
=20
L.P. to develop an internet marketplace for trading non-ferrous metals. The=
=20
joint venture, called EMETRA, intends to establish a world-wide=20
business-to-business, e-commerce trading platform for the non-ferrous metal=
s=20
markets, including physical trading and the trading of futures and options=
=20
contracts.

Why is excelr acquiring MG?
excelr is committed to expanding its position as a global leader in wholesal=
e=20
markets. By expanding into new wholesale markets, such as non-ferrous metal=
s,=20
excelr expects to leverage its wholesale expertise and will be able to offer=
=20
customers new products and solutions to address their business needs which=
=20
link different commodities and inputs.

MG will provide excelr with a number of important benefits.  At the same tim=
e,=20
excelr expects that MG will significantly benefit from its association with=
=20
excelr.  Some of the benefits we envisage include:

? The opportunity to combine excelr=01,s core competencies in trading, finan=
ce=20
and origination with MG=01,s global position in trading non-ferrous metals.

? The ability for both excelr and MG to access new clients, particularly in=
=20
the United States and Europe.

? The ability to cross-market both existing products and new products such =
as=20
bundled products that offer combined metals and power outsourcing.

? The ability to leverage the opportunities available to MG by increasing i=
ts=20
financial strength and the resources available to it.

? The chance to overlay the excelrOnline business-model on the metals indust=
ry=20
to increase liquidity and contract market share.

What remains to be done?
Merging the business operations of two entities, even highly motivated=20
companies such as excelr and MG, has been and will continue to be a formidab=
le=20
and daunting exercise.  Having a shared vision facilitates rapid integratio=
n,=20
but there are many complicated and complex tasks that remain.  During the=
=20
conditional offer period, excelr and MG are taking steps to prepare for a=20
seamless and non-disruptive integration of our respective operations. =20
Ideally, when excelr=01,s offer to buy all MG shares becomes unconditional (=
15=20
July 2000 is the current target date), the two can hit the ground with thei=
r=20
feet running.

In the short term, a number of things must be accomplished to facilitate th=
at=20
smooth transition.  Most importantly, in order to ensure that the deal goes=
=20
forward, excelr and MG will work to remove the remaining conditions to excelr=
=01,s=20
offer, including obtaining the shareholder approvals from all shareholders =
as=20
well as obtaining relevant regulatory consents.

A number of other steps must be taken, however, during the first phase of o=
ur=20
integration timetable to ensure that everything stays on track.  Integratio=
n=20
activities will focus on four primary aspects of our operations: commercial=
=20
matters, financial matters, middle and back office issues; and, most=20
importantly, on the employees of both organisations.  Some of the most=20
important goals relating to each of these areas are:

Commercial
? Developing physical metal contracts suitable for listing on excelrOnline a=
nd=20
installing necessary communication and technology links to facilitate data=
=20
transfers and information flows between MG and excelr.
? Preparing a joint venture management plan for MG's interest in EMETRA tha=
t=20
is consistent with excelr=01,s goal of listing physical metal contracts on=
=20
excelrOnline.
? Identifying opportunities to
- combine excelr's core competencies in trading, finance, and origination wi=
th=20
MG's global position in trading non-ferrous metals;
- leverage MG=01,s position by increasing its financial strength and resour=
ces=20
available to it;
- cross-market both existing and new products to excelr and MG customers,=20
particularly in the US and Europe; and
- grow MG's metal trading franchise.

Financial
? Obtaining waivers from MG's banks in respect of change of control in loan=
=20
or other agreements.
? Preparing plans to integrate cash management functions and putting in pla=
ce=20
funding arrangements for August 2000 onwards.
? Preparing plans to arrange large-scale inventory securitisation to reduce=
=20
balance sheet debt before year-end.

Middle and Back Office
? Preparing financial information necessary to understand and maximise=20
integration benefits including, pro-forma consolidated financial statements=
;=20
profit and loss budgets for the third and fourth quarters of 2000; and=20
integration budgets.
? Determining the feasibility of integrating accounting systems (AS400, SAP=
).
? Assessing  MG's core trading and risk profiles and developing plans to=20
incorporate risk profiles in MG's metals books into excelr systems. =20
? Evaluating IT systems and infra-structure at all MG office + warehouse=20
locations and preparing budgets and programmes to provide MG staff with=20
access to excelr IT systems and applications.

People
? Preparing a programme to co-locate MG's London staff (145) at excelr House=
=20
over the weekend of 16/17 September.
? Developing plans to harmonize compensation, benefits, and employment=20
policies and practices; developing plans for staff reporting relationships.
? Communicating plans and status of activities at all levels of excelr's and=
=20
MG's organizations.
? Arranging introductions between excelr and MG staff and providing=20
opportunities for information exchanges.

Where do we go from here?
I believe that excelr=01,s acquisition of MG is an exciting opportunity for =
us=20
all.  While a number of steps remain to be taken, we have already=20
successfully begun the integration of excelr and MG.  By remaining=20
enthusiastic and committed to this process, I expect that this transition=

will proceed smoothly and with a minimum of difficulty.

Thanks, Bjorn.

A few weeks back, Sydney started executing their own Confirms, where in the 
past, it had been done in Houston by myself.   Since I have not heard of this 
from Houston, I would not be doing my job if I let this go unquestioned.  I 
assume this is a policy change?

They are also making advances towards becoming an Asian hub.   As such, there 
are a few responsibilities that I currently handle, which Sydney is looking 
to take over:
 - Houston independently reconciles the broker statements daily;   the 
Settlements Clerk could handle;
 - All settlements are approved by me in Houston;  the new Settlements Clerk 
could handle this as well, or someone 
   in Houston could signoff on payment before Treasury takes action.

I guess I'm looking for assurances that Sydney is supposed to become a hub, 
and some information on exactly how autonomous they should become.   Are they 
to be completely independent, or are there to be a minimum level of controls 
between offices?

Subject: Continental Power - the case for greater experience/breadth of view 
in the controllers' position

Sally

Further to our discussion on Friday I summarise my view of Joe Gold's issues 
with the MO control process

Joe expressed some frustration with the current status as follows: -

The DPR has historically been 'filled with noise' around adjustments for 
edits on trades, provision restatements etc which negates it's effectiveness 
for him as a control/supervisory report 
The risk team appear to have been reacting to p&l 'noise'  - particularly 
around transmission adjustments rather than proactively finding booking 
solutions - or instructing IT to flex Enpower
Settlements have gained a perception in the market place for 'errors' such 
that originators are informing Joe that business is being 'lost' due to our 
perceived inability to support transactions - ( must be careful here as no 
specifics on errors have been provided )
The risk team ( post Neil Tarling's transfer to EBS ) is relatively junior 
and does not possess many 'years' of experience of Power support
James New as Power,Gas and Credit Controller has ( necessarily ) too broad a 
role for him to focus on these detailed issues

In mitigation

The recent continental book split ( which is only now being 'settled' in to 
the daily process) and the clean up of historic provisions/reserves prior to 
Neil Tarling's transfer has exaggerated the base issue around certainty of 
daily p&l
Designing an approximate booking process for transmission has not been a top 
priority for the risk team in the recent past ( this was either wrong or the 
prioritisation call  was not  effectively communicated to Joe ) - and it is 
felt that there are no IT resources to code  these solutions to Enpower ( 
also London struggles to influence Houston IT resource prioritisation )
The settlements infrastructure has been supporting a business volume growth 
it is not designed for and supporting acitivity on this platform requires 
'skilled' staff ( we are down on resources for Continental Power ) - 
continuing growth in volumes are expected along with junior settlement staff 
being asked to join Commercial groups
We are  experiencing  generational  change as a result of Barry's move to EBS 
- resourcing is James and my top priority

I believe what Joe is asking for, is what we are trying to provide - namely :

upgrade in resourcing in the risk group where we are insisting that the lead 
individual has full responsibility, end to end, for the business including 
the assessment of operational risk and effectiveness of the business process,
focus on identifying and implementing the necessary quick hit solutions that 
eliminates 'manual workarounds' and consequently 'noise' in the process
more proactive communication with Commercial - especially to manage 
expectations
a definitive plan for how the strategic upgrade in applications architecture 
for MO will benefit/change his business support

However, we are behind in finding the 'right' replacement for Neil ( one with 
experience and breadth of view potential ), we have found a continental power 
settlemetns manager but he does not arrive until July 3 rd, we have been 
struggling with book split when that should have been completed a month ago 
and it is taking time to get all the ducks lined up re our plans for 
Enlighten/DTL/EnVoice/Autoconfirms/DCAF - hence his frustration about lost 
business opportunities NOW!!

Hence I would love to find someone who could deliver the above ( ie be Neil 
Tarling's replacement ) or could assist us in
providing and communicating the judgement calls on transmission and other 
adjustments - so improving perception of C.P. DPR
prioritising and influencing Enpower development agenda ( along with others )
project manage issues around 'unstable' documentation and settlement process 
vis a vis client sensitivity
provide leadership in changing expectations/perceptions

I'm sorry for the length of the note but it may help you in determining a 
'best fit' person 

Please call if any of the above is unclear.

Further to our discussion on Friday I summarise my view of Joe Gold's issues 
with the MO control process

Joe expressed some frustration with the current status as follows: -

The DPR has historically been 'filled with noise' around adjustments for 
edits on trades, provision restatements etc which negates it's effectiveness 
for him as a control/supervisory report 
The risk team appear to have been reacting to p&l 'noise'  - particularly 
around transmission adjustments rather than proactively finding booking 
solutions - or instructing IT to flex Enpower
Settlements have gained a perception in the market place for 'errors' such 
that originators are informing Joe that business is being 'lost' due to our 
perceived inability to support transactions - ( must be careful here as no 
specifics on errors have been provided )
The risk team ( post Neil Tarling's transfer to EBS ) is relatively junior 
and does not possess many 'years' of experience of Power support
James New as Power,Gas and Credit Controller has ( necessarily ) too broad a 
role for him to focus on these detailed issues

In mitigation

The recent continental book split ( which is only now being 'settled' in to 
the daily process) and the clean up of historic provisions/reserves prior to 
Neil Tarling's transfer has exaggerated the base issue around certainty of 
daily p&l
Designing an approximate booking process for transmission has not been a top 
priority for the risk team in the recent past ( this was either wrong or the 
prioritisation call  was not  effectively communicated to Joe ) - and it is 
felt that there are no IT resources to code  these solutions to Enpower ( 
also London struggles to influence Houston IT resource prioritisation )
The settlements infrastructure has been supporting a business volume growth 
it is not designed for and supporting acitivity on this platform requires 
'skilled' staff ( we are down on resources for Continental Power ) - 
continuing growth in volumes are expected along with junior settlement staff 
being asked to join Commercial groups
We are  experiencing  generational  change as a result of Barry's move to EBS 
- resourcing is James and my top priority

I believe what Joe is asking for, is what we are trying to provide - namely :

upgrade in resourcing in the risk group where we are insisting that the lead

As a vision statement this looks like an excellent place to start. You might 
want to think about the relationship between business units (EEL, EES and EBS 
- a little political, but what the hell) and with global risk management 
operations. It might also be worth mentioning the standards that we are 
developing and which we will operate by.

Good luck.

might recognize key people on the team with some sort of 'project success' 
bonus. 


Below, I've attached an invitation to a meeting that we've scheduled for 
Wednesday. We will present plans for 5 immediate projects that we're 
proposing to address Unify issues. Let us know if you'd like to attend. Also, 
please forward names of anyone that should attend that we've missed. 

Thanks.

The only thing I would add at this stage would be under ""Daily Management P&L 
and position reporting...""

""Key positional and valuation data delivered to corporate risk aggregation 
system (""RisktRAC"") by a pre - determined time""

The form and content of that data I outlined in my last tome.

 

This will allow us to (amongst other things) get the positions aggregated and 
perform some level of assessment, and allow you folks to kill the spreadsheet 
you currently use to calculate VAR, because RisktRAC has the VAR engine.

Sally and Scott Earnest called this afternoon.  We will be setting up a new 
risk book to manage LNG positions on a worldwide basis.  Supposedly, there 
are several contracts from the old E.I. entity related to India for LNG.  
They may reference Dabhol Power project, fuel management, fuel oil, heating 
oil....

Scott desperately needs to get copies of these contracts.  Can you ask around 
with some of the contacts you made on your India trip to see if you can find 
these and get copies ?

Leslie Reeves is working on the Tom Gros project (let me know if you need 
details on this).  She has asked for top 25 counterparties on excelrOnline.   
In short, there is a new Texas law in the works that will allow for 
electronic confirming of deals, and they want to determine if any of the top 
25 are Texas companies so that we can pursue confirming deals 
electronically.  

Just wanted to get your approval before sending it on to her.

I will gladly include you on the distribution of the weekly status on the MG 
acquisition and integration and instruct Esther Gerratt to add your name to

I concur that Brent's return to Houston will create a potential information 
gap that even the best of weekly reports won't fill.  I think we may have an 
opportunity to keep your information level high and address my need to assess 
MG's remote offices.  If Brent were to linger in London for a few more 
months, we could lay out a program to assess MG's 24 offices around the world 
and benchmark their compliance with risk policies + procedures.  Brent's 
background and recent experience with Doorstep give him strong credentials 
for doing the job.  I haven't discussed this with MG's management, but it 
seems to be the right kind of activity for a new owner to undertake.  What

Steve - Mike asked  me to send him a list of what we had done to improve the 
top-level adjustments on the Benchmark.  Here are the things which we 
discussed earlier.

Mike - Let me know if you need anything else.

We have lowered the number of top-level adjustments substantially this week.  
We have taken several steps in order to achieve this.

1.  We had to adjust formatting in all text files which go into GRMS.  
2.  We are using a flip-out book for all Canadian deals done with the U.S. 
office so that Canadian positions are pulling in correctly.
3.  We had to adjust many book names in order that GRMS would pull the books 
into the system.  
4.  We had to change region codes in the system so that GRMS would pull in 
more than one book per region.

Issues remaining:

Intra-Month Canada
Chicago
Storage and Intra-East

Intra-month Canada - We have a risk person from the U.S. office going to 
Canada on Monday to fix their problems.
Chicago -  will be fixed by the end of the day.  System is looking for the 
wrong portfolio code.
Storage and Intra-East - Also will be fixed by the end of the day.  Overide 
books need to be set up.

Three people spoke at the meeting - Jeff McMahon, Louise and Philippe.  There 
was a lot of attention given to excelrOnline and it's success.  Greg Whalley 
spoke via satellite from London.  The basic theme was what it is going to 
take to survive in today's fast moving markets and how we are going to get 
there, and that in five years all businesses will be Internet companies or 
not companies at all.....  

Greg spoke briefly about what we were going to do to upgrade and expand 
existing platforms and the fact that no other player in the industry can do 
this but us because of our financial capabilities, reputation, and IT 
resources.  

Louise went over statistics, products offered, etc. on excelrOnline.

Philippe discussed all the IT projects in the works - the key one for ENA was 
enhancement of deal capture, valuation and settlements (no surprises 
there!).  One other common theme was streamlining our current systems.   He 
also confirmed the fact that we were moving from Lotus Notes to Exchange, and 
discussed the fact that we were running out of space in the building for our 
equipment (and the ability to keep the room cool) so they were looking to 
Ardmore for this.  

Jeff M. stated that we were looking for opportunities to capitalize on 
inefficiencies in the market, and get into other industries (e.g. MG Metals 
in Europe).  He also stated that excelr was going to Venture Capitalists for 
financial support and backing.  Of course, this means that excelr will have to 
give up some control, but it leads to increased deal flow, market share and 
new ideas....  He said the initial backing will be in the neighborhoods of 
$1B - most likely in Q3.  

I tried to capture the main topics, let me know if you have any questions!

Subject: Texas Unfinaled Invoices - May 2000 Production

Please find the attached spreadsheets listing the unfinaled sales invoices 
for May production.  We have indicated which group is responsible for the 
outstanding item in the ""Responsible Department"" column.  The Settlement 
coordinator is also listed on these spreadsheets.  Please have your team 
members contact the coordinators directly for the information needed to final 
the invoice.

As communicated last week in our meeting with Sally, the deadline for 
completing this work so that the invoices can be finaled is Friday, June 16, 
2000.  We appreciate any efforts your teams can make in expediting the 
research to ensure we can final all May invoices by the end of day Friday.

Thank you for your support and cooperation in these efforts.

One of our team members, Anshuman Srivastav, is currently in Houston.  It 
would probably be useful for the 2 of you to meet, so that we can understand 
exactly what your plans are with regards to LNG and what exactly you will 
require as far as contracts go.

Failing that,  the person, who is the official keeper of all our contracts, 
is Sandeep Katwala.  He should be able to get you whatever you need.

Let me know if you have any difficulties and I can try and hunt stuff down.

cc: Joel Henenberg/NA/excelr@excelr, Stephen Stock/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Re: TDS project  

I guess I have several comments to make to this string of mails....so why not 
add one more mail...

First off, Thomas is following up on my suggestion to check into TDS as when 
we met a few weeks ago (on other issues)  I heard about TDS by name for the 
first time - although I admit I was aware of work being done to replace the 
Applix functionality.  You had remarked that you liked the TDS functionality 
and wondered whether that was the way to go rather than continue to evolve 
excelr Grid.  It is unfortunate that Bill is not more cooperative with Thomas' 
request - more in the continuing saga of poor communication and information 
sharing between our two teams.
 
Clearly there needs to be much more communication and sharing of information 
as Global Rate Services for many months 'bowed' to the Sitara team's 
priorities for excelr Grid - which you now say probably won't be used.   There 
are many priorities in the wings to benefit the processes of Global Rate 
Services that without has caused us to continue to experience a high rate of 
errors - causing large impact to the P&L ($600,000 just the other day) and to 
the invoicing and payment processes.  

I have been proceeding under the impression excelr Grid was a shared 
application.  You clearly don't share that view as below you stated it is the 
responsibility of another group.  Is that why you dropped pursuit of excelr 
Grid and began developing TDS? 

Perhaps IT could meet deliverables if we provided them with a well 
thought-out plan and set of priorities, good communication, and solid project 
management.  To pursue separate solutions to try to save a struggling Sitara 
project may not have been the best answer.  We have exacerbated the IT 
resource problem by having three applications that overlap in functionality 
(Phoenix, MKM, and TDS) - oh, and pieces of ERMS too.  If that's the right 
answer, let's be sure we've discussed it before frivolously and selfishly 
pursuing our own solutions.  The 'users' you cite as knowing of TDS are not 
users at all - they are IT project managers.   Will you not have expectations 
of Global Rate Services to provide settled pricing as an input to derived 
curves ?  Will Global Rate Services responsibility end at the Phoenix door 
and it's someone else's problem if the price doesn't reflect correctly in 
TDS?  

Finally, it was certainly the intent that MKM would be the ultimate solution 
for all time series publishing in the organization-but I believe there is 
question as to whether it is the better technical solution and whether the 
design can fulfill the requirements. I wasn't aware that the pilot version of 
MKM contained any curve generation functionality.  It would be interesting to 
know how that got done, when ENA IT wasn't able to meet the basic 
deliverables of the MKM pilot.  Another disturbing element in all this 
regarding IT is - why IT did not raise a red flag that on the business side 
there were requests for overlapping functionality and conflicting priorities 
- you know, the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.

As all have said before me, a gap analysis needs to be done and a plan 
developed.  I look forward to increased communication and cooperation between 
our teams.

Subject: Re: TDS project  

Users outside of Sitara do know of TDS!  Yannis and his group have had 
discussions with Allen Severude's group regarding the TDS/Tibco 
infrastructure as well as review of ""current state"" excelr Grid.  Myself, 
Larrissa Sharma, Allan Severude, Steve Stock and Yannis have also had similar 
approach discussions.

Please note that a small portion of TDS is the replacement of the curve 
manager functionality that APPLIX currently provides (APPLIX is a trader 
tool).  There has been much user input on how the curve manager in TDS will 
be used.  Since excelrGrid/Rate Sever has not had an opportunity to handle the 
real-time (publish/subscribe) updates yet, it was suggested the 
infrastructure provided by TDS (i.e. Tibco) may be something to look.  Note 
that TDS is mentioned because of the infrastructure.  The functionality 
provided by the TDS curve manager does not encompass all the requirements 
outlined in the excelrGrid documents (functionality lacking the most is 
security, updating of ""Published"" pricing and the tie in to Rate Server -the 
TDS curve manager is built on ERMS pub/curve codes because all the trade data 
is TAGG).  Either way, the functionality that we have all been working 
through regarding how curves get published as well as subscribed to does not 
change.  Keep in mind that MKM also has curve generation functionality (to my 
knowledge, no one in Houston was part of this development). 

From a technical perspective, several items need to be addressed:

 Review/decision as to the technical direction of excelrGrid/Rate Server 
infrastructure and publish/subscribe real time development.
 Rate Server has no front end for curve generation.  excelrGrid was modified 
to provide this functionality; however excelrGrid is the responsibility of a 
different group
  (logically, this needs to come together under the same group).
 Does the TDS/Tibco infrastructure make sense (current excelrGrid/Rate Server 
design assumes the curves are always updated to the Rate Sever database and 
then    messaged from the database (potential performance impact); whereas 
Tibco infrastructure does not require a database update first)
 Does the MKM curve publish/subscribe supersede everything and provide a 
""better"" global technical solution (part of the London curve manager 
development team will be in
   Houston next week; therefore a briefing of the MKM curve manager is 
something that we are trying to get done).  Functionally, this will require a 
more vigorous gap
   analysis review before a decision can be made. 

I am open to additional discussions on the technical direction, but I do not 
think that alot of additional functional documentation needs to be done and 
timelines are not changing.

Bill,

I don't think anyone outside of Sitara knows of TDS.  If you could give 
myself and other interested parties a demo of TDS; I don't have a good 
understanding of the TDS project.   If the project is similar to the excelr 
Grid as it is indicated in Yannis's response, the business users need to come 
together and decide the system of choice.  Yannis makes good points of how to 
come to a decision. I would change that the users provide the important 
features, advantages, and shortcomings of each product as they see it.   I 
would gather the users' needs and timeline.  After deciding, I would then 
like to get IT involved to finalize a decision.  I would like to get the 
discussion started fairly soon due to the impeding business needs.  

The first thing I would suggest is have a demo of both products to inform all 
impacted business users.  Bill, can we setup a demo for tomorrow or early 
next week.

Subject: Re: TDS project  

Bill, 

I have had presentations of both of these projects (that is not to say that I 
know them well).

Since, according to Scott the choice is still open, we have to make a 
concious decision as to which way we go.  In my mind, this is a decision that 
has to be made by the user with my team's support.  I do not want and should 
not drive this decision.  The decision should be driven by the user, based on 
usage (business) requirements.  What the Phoenix group will provide is a 
server that does (or soon will) satisfy your business requirements.  The 
front end plug in is, I think,  a decoupled issue in a server-client 
environment.

On the other hand, I think we should help you with the choice (if you so want 
us).  I would actively consult with you to set up the choosing process, which 
I imagine would go somewhat like this:
I would suggest that we do, again and all deciding parties together,  get 
demos of each of these products. 
Business should put together a bullet point list of the functionality needed 
(even a timeline) and how the tool will be used so both Allan and Mike 
understand your needs clearly.
I also suggest that we ask TDS and excelr Grid  to provide us with a short 
document outlining the important features, advantages and shortcomings of 
each product as they see it.  Released features should be separated from 
future improvements; the latter should be be accompanied by a time line.  
Limitations should be listed explicitly.
We take our impressions from the demos along with the writeups in a room and 
make the decision.
If needed, business might have to spend the time to play with each of these 
products for a short period of time.

In my mind it is important to make choices like this one that will affect 
business for a long time based on enumerated and well understood facts (such 
that usually get lost from a short demo).

Please let me know what you think,

Yannis

Can you give me more information to the TDS you are working on like the due 
dates, the scope, etc.  If you got some requirements documents or the 
business plan on the project, it would be better.  I just want to get a

We will definitely need a lot more information related to the items below.  
Please let me know when we can meet and discuss these.  Some of the items we 
will need to know include:

We discussed discrepancies your team noted between the spreadsheet positions 
that are being captured and what's reported on the Gas BM report.  This is 
causing you to manually adjust the Gas BM report.  Is this for all 
spreadsheet positions?  Some of them?  Is the variance significant?  Is it 
off everyday?  
What do you mean by "" All Transport Models"".   Does this mean positions?  Are 
transport positions on the Gas BM report?  Are they manual adjustments?  Are 
they in GRMS?  Can we capture these with spreadsheets?
What is your current methodology in preparing the Gas BM report for 
roll-offs?  Is it currently consistent across all regions or is it handled 
differently by different traders?  Please explain this in further detail. The 
Basis roll-off was done in the GRMS system in the past.  Is this still the 
case?  If not, we need to capture these roll-off adjustments using 
spreadsheets?
Can we make the Fixed Price Canadian Deals adjustments using spreadsheets 
that can be captured in GRMS?
Also, what is the status of capturing IM-Canada positions in the system?

We will need this type of information urgently.  We are meeting with Jeff 
Shankman on Tuesday to update him on the progress we are making.  

Please let me know if there is anything we can do to help.

he was going to need some help in integrating another business within Gas 
Trading (and alluded to the possibility of it being Liquids related).  My

four other directors/senior directors from Energy Operations.   I completed 
the evaluations of the four candidates that I interviewed and submitted 
those, but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to 
commitments to attend a funeral.  I talked with Ted Bland this morning and he 
suggested that I provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in 
Energy Operations.  

Analysts

Tara Piazze - potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams

Joseph Piotrowski - AA consulting background; would be a good fit for my 
operations team focused on EOL (these are ENA employees) -- I need to add 
more  strength to this group

Charles Ames - currently works in back office for a brokerage firm; wants  to 
trade; would like to have him in risk to learn the business and excelr's risk 
books;  we  could immediately benefit from his background, while he learns 
excelr and how we manage risk; then he could add even more value in moving to 
a trading  role, if appropriate


Better Fits as Direct Hires (not analyst or associate, based on work 
experience and fit)

Mike Perun - VP of small bank; Ted brought him in with my group in mind; two 
of my directors interviewed him on Saturday; we'd like to consider him as a 
direct hire

Jason Sukenik- Undergrad and masters degrees in accounting, plus MBA; could 
be good fit as direct hire in as manager/director based on experience


Associates

Ryan Ngo - I believe that Kevin Presto suggested him for my group

Adele Pickens - She's on my list; need to research interviewers comments who 
suggested my group for an assignment for her (I don't think that anyone from  
Energy Operations interviewed him or her) 

Jennifer Bagwell - Apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not 
want to trade; would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk 
or operations

have a strong background in trading operations?  Will he be  able to 
coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able 
to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump 
start on how best to assimilate the business?   I think that this effort 
should be much broader than deal testing.  It should encompass assessing 
people, processes, controls, systems support, etc.  To do this quickly and 
effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading 
operations.   I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be 
the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in 
operations on a daily basis.  

Patrick Conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in 
with an appropriate team from ENA to review the Chicago and New York 
offices.  From the sound of Naomi's memo, it looks as if Andy Cornfield is 
assume to have the US responsibility. Again, I don't know Andy.

By way of background, he was previously working with Eastern in the UK in a

Bridgeline's decision and would solely be based on whether or not they are, 
in fact, trading as defined in EITF 98-10.  There are about 4 pages of 
criteria set forth in that document.  That may be a question you want to ask 
Trevor Mihalik, but I do know that initially they did not meet 98-10

I am confused by your suggestion about whether or not to involve commercial.  
I may not understand, but we do already have a means to track our 40 %.  We 
can certainly mark 60% of any business we do with Bridgeline, but the other 
40% should be treated as affiliate business.

Wes - Are we still anticipating that Bridgeline will be allowed 
mark-to-market status at some point in the future?  If so, what criteria must 
Bridgeline meet and what is the expected timeline on it?  If this is going to 
happen soon, I would suggest that we avoid getting Commercial involved and 
developing a process to track our 40% portion of Bridgeline.

Steve,

AA has indicated that our proposal with regard to transactions done between 
ENA and Bridgeline sounds OK.  They did bring up a good point about how the 
40% would be shown for purposes of position and loss limits, which under our 
scenario of just using schedule 'C' to defer the 40%  we would effectively be 
showing the 100% for all other measures.  I told them that we would monitor 
for materiality before putting a manual process in place.

I think we should now meet with the commercial folks to explain the real p\l 
impact.  Would you take the lead on deciding who that should be and get a 
meeting set up?

Thanks

Doug

The Doorstep team will wish to visit any MG trading locations in order to do 
deal testing.  In order to weed out the origination offices from trading 
offices we have agreed the following approach with Brent.  You were 
unanimously voted as the man to co-ordinate the effort.

1.  As there are various suitable (i.e. ex-auditors/risk controls) excelr 
people visiting certain offices, they will use the standard questionnaire 
(Brent should send this to you) in order to establish if the activity is of a 
trading nature.  These people (so far identified) are myself (Liverpool on 
Tuesday), Andy (Germany & US offices from 19th June), Lloyd Fleming (same as 
Andy) & Tani Nath (Korea & Singapore next week I believe).

2.  AA are internal auditor of MG.  I have arranged with Sarah Williams to 
get the MG internal audit manager to organise a meeting with you in order for 
you to review the audit plans and understand what they have reviewed, whether 
their internal audit includes deal testing, how they have already reviewed 
(or not) the remote offices.....  You should plan to report back to Andy, 
Brent & I on Friday (please could you organise the meeting).  I have the 
audit report for MGL & MGMCC audit is due to start on tuesday.

3.  Once we have clarified the extent of AAs work we will assess what else 
needs to happen and who to get in to the various different offices to 
complete the reviews.

Many thanks

Hope all is going well.  The following is a list of things I'm working on.  

I'm midway through putting together the ""straw-man"" for the doorstep review - 
which will consist of a proposal on what our goals are, what should be done 
to meet those goals, who should do it, and when it should be done.  I hope to 
have it ready for your review during the week of the 12th.  I'm working 
together with Rick Carson on it, and also obtaining input from all the people 
who participated in previous doorstep reviews.
I'm working with Mike to determine what gaps we have in the DPR process 
(certain info may not be complete, some books are not received on a timely 
basis).  We have some thoughts, I just need to write them up and do a bit of 
research to determine how to deal with these issues.
I have a meeting set up with Jan-Erland for next Friday to discuss Japan.  
I've been attending the conference calls, but need to establish my role in 
the process.  I also received a message from Joe Hirl, and will set up a 
meeting with him while I'm in Japan.
I've made initial contact with India, and will start attending their 
conference calls.  Milind Laad has asked me to fly down to see the office, 
but before I do that, I need to get up to speed with what they have done 
already.
I've met with Eugenio and we have discussed the projects he works on.  He and 
I need to structure what his future projects are and the resources needed for 
those projects.
I'll be in London next week (I leave this Sunday and will be back in the 
office on Friday) working with Brent.  I expect he will be able to give me a 
lot of information to help with the doorstep straw-man.

Patti is trying to set up a weekly or bi-weekly discussion for us, starting 
the week of the 12th. Until that time, I'll keep you updated through e-mail 
and voice mail.  If you need me, I have given Patti all my contact info for

Hi Sally

I'm very sorry to bother you, but can you please connect me with a member of 
your team who can help me with a query on Scott Lytle's cost centre.

The cost centre you provided to Tara (Project Q - 800001745) is not accepted 
by our UK SAP system, so we need another code asap as he has already started 
work here.

Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks and apologies again for bothering you with such a trivial query.

Senior level risk people

Andy Dunn
until 3 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management practice.  Due 
to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client related), he left 
the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit and the non-audit 
personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  I have worked 
with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend him to excelr.  
The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to travelling a lot, 
but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not interested in 
leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith
Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in Houston.  We worked 
very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for Coral Energy and Equiva 
trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 15 years where he had 
many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, products trader, he worked 
in the risk management department, in the refinery itself as an engineer).  
Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are extremely impressed with his 
knowledge and background.  I would highly recommend him for a leadership role 
at excelr.  I spoke to him and he is interested in pursuing opportunities at 
excelr.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  His cell phone number is 713 412 
3890.



IT/Risk people


Shawn lafferty, Alan Beaton, & Carolyn Johnson
These people are all senior managers in KPMG's Information risk management 
department and are all looking for opportunities outside KPMG.  They all have 
8+ years work experience in the IT field.  KPMG's main number is 713 319 2000.


Mid level risk people


Marilyn Chee 
She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of accounting for 
derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and all mtm 
accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was their auditor.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Scott Barnes
Scott is an audit manager at PwC.  He has worked in energy for his career, 
which he spent in Houston and Moscow and New York.  He has worked as an audit 
manager, a special projects manager for the managing partner of the Houston 
office, a manager in the capital markets group (the group responsible for 
helping non-US companies prepare to register and list with the SEC), and the 
transaction support group (the group that is resposnible for performing due 
diligence procedures for PwC clients).  He is looking for opportunities 
outside PwC.  The PwC general line is 713 356 4000.

Keith Considine
He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best senior PwC 
Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have ever worked 
with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of work experience 
(all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked for me on the 
Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent evaluation from both 
myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of the best people any 
of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working on a project at one 
of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office processes .  He definitely 
does not see himself as a long time employee of PwC, but is currently 
planning on staying there until he is promoted to manager.  I actually 
recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 this year, but due to 
capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will be approved. His 
number is 713 356 5617.


Junior level risk people

Robin Manspeaker 
currently works as a scheduler at Equiva Trading.  She has been there about a 
year and a half.  Before that, she worked at Novarco in White Plains (a 
subsidiary of Marc Rich).  She was there about 3 years.  I do not know where 
she was before that.  I have worked with her during my audits of Marc Rich.  
She seemed very well versed in her knowledge of her job and processes 
surrounding it. I do not have her number, but you can call Shell information 
at 713 241 6161 and they will transfer you.

Dave Simpson
Analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting and has work 
experience of about 2 years.  He is very interested in leaving Koch.  I know 
him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a good guy and 
very likeable.  His phone number is 713 544 7649

Robert Hernandez
is someone who may be able to fill an open position at excelr South America.  
Last year, Robert worked for me at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on the 
external audit of Coral Energy.  He was a great worker and very good at his 
job.  He speaks fluent Spanish as well as fluent English.

Before working at PwC, Robert worked in the gas trading industry in the 
mid/back office.  I'm not sure of all of his responsibilities, but I do know 
he was involved in gas actualizations. In total, I think he has about 4 years 
of work experience.

He left PwC in March to take a position with Heins in their internal audit 
department.  I have not spoken to him since he left, but do know he paid a 
recruiter to find him this position.  I do not know if he is happy at his 
current company or not.

I do not know his number, but he can surely be found by using the general 
line.  I looked it up for you and came up with two - 713 785 1494, 713 225 
0565.


Admin assistants


Connie Shugart
she is currently working at PwC as an administrative assistant.  She is also 
involved in recruiting experienced personnel for PwC's audit and internal 
audit service lines.  She is very interested in excelr and has asked me a few 
times to get her a contact here.  I have not worked directly with her but due 
to her close proximity to my office I talked to her a number of times and was 
very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC number).  I have spoken to her 
about giving her name to Tony and she is very excited about coming over and 
interviewing.  She really wants to work for excelr!

Ellen Robertson
She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave PwC.   I have 
never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on how she 
should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).",Non Abusive

Go ahead and schedule lunch for Thursday, June 1st. I am trying to

Houston that day and also needs to visit with Sally about the upcoming Fall

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL/SOLICITOR-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

This E:mail is to confirm the all employee staff meeting this morning. 

As discussed, various representatives of Industry Canada will be in our 
offices over the next number of days to investigate certain matters under the 
authority of an Order granted in the Federal Court of Canada.  

Industry Canada is pursuing an application with respect to certain 
allegations involving excelr Canada Corp. and which we obviously believe to be 
unsubstantiated, as will be ultimately proven in the normal course of 
proceedings.  

This memo is to confirm the following:

1. Each of the individuals from Industry Canada may enter into conversations 
with you, ask you questions about our business or your business, ask you to 
provide information, documentation, etc.  In this regard, excelr Canada 
Corp.'s interests are represented by the law firm of Blake, Cassels & 
Graydon.  Each member of Industry Canada has assigned to it a representative 
of the firm of Blake, Cassels & Graydon, under the supervision of Dalton 
McGrath, who is a partner with his firm.  You are not speak to or provide any 
such information to any of the representatives of Industry Canada except 
under the authority and direction of a representative of Blake, Cassels & 
Graydon.  In other words, you are to advise the representatives of Industry 
Canada that you need to seek the advice and instructions of counsel before 
speaking with them or providing any information.

2. Although it is business as usual, as is the case whenever we have any 
outside visitors in the office, it is important to maintain the 
confidentiality of your business and your information.  In other words, the 
representatives of Industry Canada are here for a specified purpose and they 
should be treated no differently than any other third parties when you are 
discussing, negotiating or documenting transactions that do not concern them.

3. It is excelr Canada Corp.'s intention to be cooperative and 
non-obstructive.  At the same time, it is both appropriate and customary that 
we do not assist the representatives of Industry Canada in doing their jobs.  
In other words, they know what they are looking for, and it is appropriate 
and customary for us not to point them in any particular direction, which may 
be the right or wrong direction.  Again, documentation and information 
requests are to be handled directly through Blake, Cassels & Graydon under 
the supervision of Dalton McGrath.

4. If the representatives of Industry Canada take any information (whether in 
physical, electronic or other form) it is imperative that through a 
representative of Blake, Cassels & Graydon that information is inventoried, 
and please ensure that this is the case.  All such information will be 
subject to a legal privilege and therefore it is important to specifically 
identify any information requested or acquired.

5. Although this matter may come out in the public domain, either 
intentionally or unintentionally, it is imperative that this matter not 
become in the public domain through any act or omission of an excelr Canada 
Corp. employee.  It is a duty of your employment, consistent with any other 
matter affecting your employment, that this matter be kept strictly 
confidential and within the confines of excelr Canada Corp. (i.e. not to be 
discussed with your counterparts in Houston) on a need to know basis.  This 
includes, particularly with representatives of Industry Canada in the office, 
that this matter is not the subject of gossip or ""coffee talk"".  

6. If you receive a request to discuss this matter through the media or other 
such outlet, you are not to respond to that request, and all matters should 
be referred to Rob Milnthorp, who will deal with them appropriately.  If the 
requests come from customers, competitors, acquaintances, family, 
counterparts in Houston, and the like, you are simply to advise that you are 
unable to discuss the matter.

7. All matters are to be handled through the following people:

Rob Milnthorp, for all commercial matters;
Peter Keohane, for all legal matters; and
Dalton McGrath or one of his designated representatives of Blake, Cassels & 
Graydon.

I want to emphasize that excelr Canada Corp. is doing all of the appropriate 
things to ensure that our rights and interests are protected, while being as 
cooperative as possible.  I want to emphasize the excelr Canada Corp. believes 
any claim made by or through Industry Canada is without merit, and the steps 
we have taken should only be viewed as prudent and not as any indication of 
any liability by excelr Canada Corp.

Regards, Peter

It seems the way this is set up,  IBM will piecemeal us and get a lot of work 
without a significant ""get"" for excelr (ie an outsourcing or a bandwidth or

Are there IT and Process issues?  Is Sally involved.  Maybe they are

Subject: Re: excelr Trading  

I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working 
with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help 
insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place 
in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as 
an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying 
the coal.  Therefore, the net excelr position will probably be carried in the 
London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to 
determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These 
books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd 
party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local 
curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and 
energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading 
activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process 
(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management 
administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting 
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general 
ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The 
following questions need to be addressed:  

  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be 
required?
      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for 
determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the 
      policy, if necessary.   
  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?
      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure 
required for the India office.    

Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and 
arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen 
complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your 
hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we 
demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain 
sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. 

Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date. 


Thanks,
Wanda Curry

Subject: People to consider recruiting

As requested, I've created a list of people who:
have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to excelr.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to excelr.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at excelr.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the 
audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).

Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best 
senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have 
ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of 
work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked 
for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent 
evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of 
the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working 
on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office 
processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of 
PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to 
manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 
this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will 
be approved. Since I've only been with excelr a short time and would like to 
continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith 
to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His 
number is 713 356 5617.

Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting 
and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving

Subject: People to consider recruiting

As requested, I've created a list of people who:
have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to excelr.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to excelr.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at excelr.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the 
audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).

Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best 
senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have 
ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of 
work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked 
for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent 
evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of 
the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working 
on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office 
processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of 
PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to 
manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 
this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will 
be approved. Since I've only been with excelr a short time and would like to 
continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith 
to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His 
number is 713 356 5617.

Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting 
and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving 
Koch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a 
good guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be 
reachable through the general number for Koch.

Subject: Action plan

Sally

Thank you for taking the time to see me when I was in Houston, and for lunch. 

I am working on a detailed comprehensive plan of action to enact the changes 
we discussed re the settlement and confirmations procedures transfer. Due to 
the volume of work that was on my desk upon my return this is not coming 
together quite as quickly as I would like and therefore we are going to have 
to look at it piece by piece. 

We need to issue a new authorised signatory list this week for excelr 
Australia Energy and excelr Australia Finance Pty Ltd due to changes in the 
dealer structure and therefore we have decided that this would be a good 
opportunity to make the change to the approval of confirmations. 

As agreed, we will have Sydney office take over responsibility for signing 
all confirmations. This means they are still prepared in Sydney, as they are 
now, with the change of procedure being that they will now be signed in 
Sydney and faxed from here to our clients. The primary signatories will be 
the Managing Director (Paul Quilkey) or the Chief Financial Officer (Heidi 
Mason). In the event of both being unavailable they will be signed by the 
Senior Legal Counsel (David Minns). 

The confirmation log will be maintained in its entirety by Sydney Office and 
will be held in a directory accessible by Houston. This will allow 
independent audit review to occur as required. 

In order to implement this change we have prepared a new authorised 
signatories list which we are planning to distribute at the end of this week. 
In the meantime could you please advise of what action needs to be taken in 
Houston to ensure all the relevant areas are advised. Clearly a  key 
individual will be Sue Frusco. When I met with Sue in Houston we discussed 
briefly the fact that you and I had agreed that invoicing and confirmations 
would move to Sydney but at that stage there was no timing raised. Sue seemed 
happy to stay with the current arrangements until such time as we implemented 
a change. Do you want me to advise Sue or will someone from Houston speak to 
her?

Thanks

Heidi

I decided that this would be the quickest way to get in touch this afternoon,
as I know you must be very busy after taking yesterday off to be with us, and
also I know you will have many things you would like to do at home tonight.
There is no way to say thanks for the great two days.  You are always so
gracious and generous in every way, time, thought, etc.

I really enjoyed going with you to your office and now I can picture you each
day.  I found it very pleasent to sit at your desk.  Please tell Patti that I
enjoyed meeting her.

Thanks so much for taking me to see the interesting shop, and I will look
forward to going there again and using my generous Mother's Day gift
certificate!!  I am still thinking about the table I saw there-it is not a
lot larger than the table I have, but I like the fact that it is a cabinet.

It was very interesting to see your house and what has been done and what you
plan to do with your furnishings.  I think it will be wonderful and I look
forward to seeimg it all finished.  Keep me posted on what is going on and
what decisions you make.  I really do think you and your family will enjoy
the spacious large room.

I do hope David will have good news about his problem and hope that it can be
easily treated.

I thoroughly enjoyed the recital, and I think Amanda played beautifully.
Please tell her that I am so proud of her with the way she is doing in her
music, with the wonderful gold medal, and also doing so great in her school
work.  I hope she has a great two weeks at camp, and I am sure that you will
send me her camp address.  When you have time we can plan her visit time.

It was fun seeing Meagan, and she was very thoughtful to bring Michael by to
see us.  I mentioned to her that if she just wanted a change of scenery after
she goes to camp we would love for her to come over and visit.

Tyler was so much fun too, and especially now that he really knows who we are
and is comfortable with us.  We better stay strong and well so he can have
some visits with us!

I know I probably have forgotten something, but  the visit with you was
great.  Thanks you for being such a loving, thoughtful, and generous
daughter.  I am very proud of you.

with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help 
insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place 
in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as 
an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying 
the coal.  Therefore, the net excelr position will probably be carried in the 
London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to 
determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These 
books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd 
party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local 
curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and 
energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading 
activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process 
(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management 
administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting 
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general 
ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The 
following questions need to be addressed:  

  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be 
required?
      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for 
determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the 
      policy, if necessary.   
  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?
      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure 
required for the India office.    

Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and 
arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen 
complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your 
hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we 
demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain 
sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. 

Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date.

Wanda,

It was nice talking to you on the conference call. Have you had a chance to 
review my presentation?. Your comments would be extremely helpful to me. When 
we setup the Risk/Credit/Accnt/MIS/Internal Control function, I want to make 
sure we do it RIGHT the FIRST time, keeping in mind that there is always room 
for improvement later.

In addition, I would like to discuss with you certain thought I have on the 
accounting, budgeting,internal controls and internal audit areas in EIPL. Do 
you plan to travel to India in the near future. Please let me know.

Thanks and Regards.

I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working 
with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help 
insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place 
in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as 
an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying 
the coal.  Therefore, the net excelr position will probably be carried in the 
London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to 
determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These 
books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd 
party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local 
curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and 
energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading 
activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process 
(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management 
administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting 
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general

Subject: Summer Analyst Information Session

THANK YOU .... to those of you who attended the summer analyst info session.  
For those of you who couldn't attend,  the information will be delivered to 
you via inter-office mail.  

As we discussed yesterday, our goal is to ensure a quality summer for all of 
our interns.  To continue in those efforts we encourage you to schedule a 
meeting with your intern during his/her first week to:
 explain group/department initiatives
establish roles/responsibilities and define performance expectations

ALSO, PLEASE NOTE:  interns starting on Monday, May 22 will be available to 
report directly to their supervisors following lunch.  Due to availability 
and limited space, PC training will take place later in the week.  Interns 
that start on June 5 will report to their supervisors that afternoon 
following PC training. 

Thank you again for your time and your support.  Please contact me if you 
have any questions.

Subject: AA request on DPR to G\L entry

Someone from Arthur Andersen called Troy today asking to see the details of 
our DPR to G\L entry for March accounting.  I instructed him to tell them 
that we would be happy to set up a meeting for later next week to sit down 
with them and OA to discuss the process, the April numbers and the 
reconciliation of those numbers.  As I believe you all know, the entry that 
we had to book in March was close to $49 million and the April entry was 
closer to $25 million.  They know how the process works and should understand 
that the variances coming from the first several months are primarily timing, 
but experience tells me that they will over react if we simply turn over the 
analysis showing $49 as they have requested.  In light of the current 
reconciliation effort do you think we will be able to talk to them about the 
older items ( I would suggest only discussing things that fall into the 1999 
and prior category) late next week?

Let me know your thoughts.

incompleteness of the list of issues. As I outlined, the key point has been 
identified, but its knock - on effects are widespread and worrying, 
especially as they concern the Continental Power operation:

As of today the most recent finalised DPR for this business was for 11th May, 
and during the period between then and now we have seen (although in milder 
form) a repeat of the turmoil on the Amsterdam Power Exchange (APX) that we 
witnessed in January this year. This is not the time or the market to not 
know our position.

The business is soon to apply for higher limits to accommodate a new 
transaction on the Polish border. I am bound to comment that based on the 
state it appears to be in, I would not recommend higher limits.

To add insult to injury, as a result of the way this area has been allowed to 
develop, much of the know-how is in the heads (and spreadsheets) of certain 
key individuals who it seems are now bound rapidly for EBS. 

UK Gas seems to have slipped too. Yesterday they reported a $7m loss due to 
the value of a set of options which were part of a structured deal, booked 
""off-system"" and not revalued for over a month. Worryingly, there seemed to 
be more time spent arguing over the nuances of a Loss Notification memo, than 
answering some fundamental questions about why it happened.

As a corollary, our process of performing ""risk reviews"" has become all the 
more important in identifying holes in our capture and treatment of market 
risk in the firm. I expect these to play a big part in our effort to 
stabilise these areas.

Subject: Re: Project Doorstep Responsibility Matrix  


Thanks for the summary. I was out last week so apologies if my comments 
arrive too late. Here they are anyway:


1 Socrates

I think it inappropriate for me, or anyone in RAC for that matter, to have 
primary responsibility for this system/project.

But if I were responsible the first thing I would want to know is why this 
project, which commenced in May 1998, as I recall, is still incomplete, given 
that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in 
history, concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart.


2 Exhaustive ?

It doesn't look like an exhaustive list and I suspect it was not intended to 
be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such. 


3 Symptoms or Causes ?

Many of the points look like the former, and addressed as they stand will 
likely leave us with a Band-aid solution which will drop off when pressure is 
applied. 
In fact many of them look like they are a result of Point 5 : 

 ""Prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control 
functionality...""

because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten, confirmation 
errors get made, deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright 
people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think 
about changing the way they work. And, for example, when those people move 
on, as they surely will, the institution has no memory of how to do what they 
did. 

I am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on 
Microsoft Excel all day, everyday. 


4 Overall

I think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way. Rather 
than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking 
off, we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate.

As a hypothesis, if most issues stem from Point 5, then I would ask why has 
prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control 
functionality ?

Subject: Notes on ASE Studio

Hello Mary- 

Here is a rough strating point of the ASE Studio planning document.  I have 
included the objectives we discussed initially - we will continue to refine 
them as we move forward.  

Also, I inserted the notes I made during the offsite on Friday.  My notes 
were primarily focused on information that the participants were wanting or 
that I thought might be useful.  Also, I jotted down quite a few questions 
that came up during the session.  Some of them were addressed on Friday and 
others were not.  We do not necessarily need to address all of these at the 
ASE - and I would suspect there are others that should be addressed but are 
not listed here.  I'm sending this information in advance for your review and 
thought.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss, please let me know.

Thank you for taking the time to see me when I was in Houston, and for lunch. 

I am working on a detailed comprehensive plan of action to enact the changes 
we discussed re the settlement and confirmations procedures transfer. Due to 
the volume of work that was on my desk upon my return this is not coming 
together quite as quickly as I would like and therefore we are going to have 
to look at it piece by piece. 

We need to issue a new authorised signatory list this week for excelr 
Australia Energy and excelr Australia Finance Pty Ltd due to changes in the 
dealer structure and therefore we have decided that this would be a good 
opportunity to make the change to the approval of confirmations. 

As agreed, we will have Sydney office take over responsibility for signing 
all confirmations. This means they are still prepared in Sydney, as they are 
now, with the change of procedure being that they will now be signed in 
Sydney and faxed from here to our clients. The primary signatories will be 
the Managing Director (Paul Quilkey) or the Chief Financial Officer (Heidi 
Mason). In the event of both being unavailable they will be signed by the 
Senior Legal Counsel (David Minns). 

The confirmation log will be maintained in its entirety by Sydney Office and 
will be held in a directory accessible by Houston. This will allow 
independent audit review to occur as required. 

In order to implement this change we have prepared a new authorised 
signatories list which we are planning to distribute at the end of this week. 
In the meantime could you please advise of what action needs to be taken in 
Houston to ensure all the relevant areas are advised. Clearly a  key 
individual will be Sue Frusco. When I met with Sue in Houston we discussed 
briefly the fact that you and I had agreed that invoicing and confirmations 
would move to Sydney but at that stage there was no timing raised. Sue seemed 
happy to stay with the current arrangements until such time as we implemented 
a change. Do you want me to advise Sue or will someone from Houston speak to 
her?

Thanks

Heidi

Subject: Houston Gas & Power Controls/Standards Assessment

As you all are aware, there is a heightened awareness throughout the company 
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing 
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success 
at achieving those standards.  I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on 
meeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in 
an extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their 
gas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review 
to start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement 
methodology for the London office.

In order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards 
across excelr, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment 
for the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and 
other commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and 
Wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.

I have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so 
that we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those 
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not 
operating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to 
develop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:
 - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash 
collections are timely)
 - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its 
maximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date 
with            exceptions noted)
 - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard 
(i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)
 - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each 
measurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)

I would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control 
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of 
work has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time 
requirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to 
be completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a 
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but 
it is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.

As discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for 
each functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk 
associated with each control.  I would like to achieve consensus on gas and 
power operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know 
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process.  I look forward 
to seeing you next week.

force.  To keep you up to date on what is going on:

I am receiving sporadic reporting from most groups. 
I have hired someone to be dedicated to this process (starting 1/1/01 - until 
then, it is me and one person starting 12/11 who can dedicate some time)
The key focus is report A01 and getting that consolidated - I am taking a 
stab at it today.
I am meeting with an Access programmer to develop a reporting tool to replace 
the current Excel format
By the end of the year my goal is to have daily reporting from all groups, to 
have someone dedicated to review this daily reporting and raise issues, and 
to have a dedicated IT person developing the Access database, to have weekly 
consolidated reporting for A01, to determine the appropriate time frames for 
reporting escalation and audience

What I would like the task force to concentrate on is to:
Help review the individual reporting to determine if:
It is adequate
Where we should go from the current reporting guidelines
Decide on appropriate audiences and levels for issue communication
Decide on reporting formats
Steer the process

I will send you copies of the reporting for the next couple of days so you 
can get an understanding of what I am receiving and the problems people are 
having.  Let me know your thoughts and concerns and I will consolidate them 
and then we can discuss them as part of the task force.

Dear Melissa,

I am a friend Mark and Lynn Richards through a family connection in the
Carolinas.  Mark suggested that I contact you.  Through my own research and
recommendations from peers, I am truly interested in exploring employment
opportunities at excelr.  I am scheduled to meet with David Chang this
Wednesday in order to discuss possibilities in the Broadband area.  If you
are available in the near-term, I would very much appreciate a few minutes
of your time in order to discuss other logical opportunities for someone
with my work experience and educational background.

I am attaching my resume; however, in summary, I am currently working in
Corporate Planning and Development at Reliant Energy.  My responsibilities
include the analysis of potential mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures.
In addition, I work with each business unit within Reliant Energy in order
to create a strategic, long-term forecast for the Company, incorporating
such uncertainties as deregulation in the Texas electricity markets.  Prior
to Reliant Energy, I worked as a Financial Analyst for Esso Caribbean and
Central America in Miami, Florida.  My direct responsibilities included
financial reporting and profitability analyses for Esso affiliates operating
in the Caribbean and Latin America.  I am also a 1997 graduate of
Thunderbird with a concentration in finance and a regional focus on Latin

I would really like her on the ground by early July - when I have 2 weeks

I made the assumption when you said that Jim Fallon had said that Kristin's 
name was ""in play"", that he and Kristin had coordinated a transition with 
Kevin Presto that made him comfortable.  At an ENA offsite meeting on 
Wednesday and Thursday last week, I talked with Kevin during a break to see 
if was comfortable with Kristin's number two as his risk lead.  
Unfortunately, Kevin knew nothing about this.  So rather than discuss the

some very valid business reasons as to why Kristin's movement over the summer 
months would be risky for ENA.  You and I can discuss those if you would

already put them on by now.

I will be in Houston the end of this month (May 30- June 2) and would like
to take you to lunch if possible and get caught up on everything.  I have
also asked Mike McConnell to join us if possible. Hopefully the two of you
have a free day available for lunch and can coordinate a time and day. Let
me know if and when the two of you would be available and I will schedule
around your plans.

I guess Michelle, Clay and Blake will have been there for a week when I am
there.  I was sad to see George leave the recruiting side, as he really did
a good job of promoting excelr to both OU and my students. I know he will do
a great job at excelr OnLine.

Hope all is going well with your father and that you are not constantly
traveling around the world and being away from your family.

Look forward to hopefully seeing you later this month.

our most important sources.  As you suggest, the intent is to use this data 
along with other available date to generate a price for credit.  The price 
will be published externally (likely for a fee and as a free service) via the 
web or via automated processes.  

Option 3 appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to 
date data as possible.  Stuart is working with the credit team to define 
additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely 
what we are looking for.  Alternatively, if it is possible to obtain the 
actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to 
generate our own score in addition to D&B's.  We will need the Global Failure 
Score as well.  Currently we are active in Europe as well as the US and 
expect to move towards Asia and Austrailia over time.  Hopefully, this data 
is available via D&B Connect.

Another consideration is the term of contract.  We would likely prefer a 
longer term contract so that if they decide they don't like what we are doing 
with the data, we cannot be cut off.  Does it make sense from your 
perspective to approach D&B to be our long term, strategic providor of 
customer data.  This would likely make their deal maker look good in his 
boss's eyes, give you lot's of negotiating ability and give a us the long 
term preferential contract that we are looking for.

Let's discuss further.

Subject: Dun & Bradstreet Info for Credit Trading

I have received preliminary information from D&B.  I think several 
issues/questions have been raised that if explored, could result in a better 
solution for the money.  

Option 1
The update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to 
monthly for a cost of $87,000 (USD) through March, 2001.

Option 2
I wasn't sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in.  If 
you are particularly interested in the Financial Stress Score and Credit 
Score, for example, there are multiple alternatives :
 
 2a) Keep quartlery refresh of base data (party name, etc) and refresh scores 
that are added/changed on a monthly basis.  Cost - $1.17(USD) per 
record.          Note that there are 575,000 records in the file currently 
with financial and credit scores, making this potentially a very expensive 
alternative 
        (575,000 X 1.17=$ 672,750).

 2b) Batch or FTP updates of the financial and stress scores can only be 
provided monthly.  D&B is working on a solution that would provide a 
weekly         update to their customers in a batch or FTP manner, but has 
not committed to when this will be ready.  Therefore, if more timely updates 
than monthly                          are desired, it is also possible to 
transactionally access records one at a time using D&B's software.  The cost 
for this is extremely high at $10.52         (USD) per score. 

Option 3
D&B Connect Product.
 D&B Connect is a tool set of matching software, an externally validated 
reference file, credit and marketing information, and D&B services that 
enables the  most effective integration of customer information and 
third-party information with D&B information.  Only this type of process and 
information integration  capability can facilitate and ensure accurate 
identification, linkage and maintenance of your customer's complete 
relationship.   In addition, D&B Connect  assures organizations of 
referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to D&B so 
that the most recent D&B information is always  transmitted to your 
organization and updated within your local D&B Connect Reference File.  D&B 
Connect is scalable.  

 Cost Typically ranging from
 * Customer Access Module (CAM) Batch- - $25,000
 * CAM Online - $50,000
 * Full Information Integrator - $350,000 + data

With more specifics as to your needs, this option should perhaps be pursued.


Questions/Issues

1) D&B had questions regarding the use of their data and whether excelr 
customers would be offered this information for a fee or free.  I explained 
that I  did not feel the data would be offered directly to excelr customers, 
but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available 
externally via web  site, etc.  All pricing above is based upon this 
understanding.  If I have not portrayed the usage correctly, it will be 
imperative to get a better understanding  before final pricing can be 
negotiated.

2)  Are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?  
Alternatives may vary by data element.  Financial Stress Score and Credit 
Score reference  above were explored as an example.

3)  What is timeframe for needing a solution ?

4)  Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on U.S. 
companies.  A comparable measure - Global Failure Score (the liklihood of 
default or  bankruptcy)  is available for international companies.  This 
rating score however, is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner.  
This could result  in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this 
score in a batch manner.

5)  Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit 
analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes.  This is 
probably  negotiable as the data is the same.  The thought process is that if 
the repository is used for credit or risk decisions, D&B will see decreased 
usage and  revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments.

during the morning hours.  The Sitara bridge failed at 10:35a.m.  and we came 
very close to missing our nom deadlines on several next day deals.  We 
(Product Control) do have a safeguard in place (our IT department is beeped 
if a deal stays in intermediate status for over 5 minutes), but we did not 
receive timely notification of this issue - it was at least 15 minutes after 
the problem started.  We have fixed that going forward - Jennifer Denny and 
Torrey Moorer will be beeped in addition to IT.  

We will continue to make every effort to watch the bridge; however, the Risk

ensure that any deals that fail are entered into the downstream systems on a 
timely basis, and primarily to alert us of any problems ASAP.  If anyone in

The May 18th date is locked in stone.  We have already reserved seats on a 
Continental flight @ Noon Thursday, May 18.  It's unfortunate that Mark was 
not kept up to date, but we have only moved back the date 1 time due to the 
May Day riots.  Tom and I have been in constant contact and we have confirmed 
the move-out date.  The book-split project will be implemented tomorrow and I 
will spend the next few days ensuring that the traders understand how to book 
their deals and that Risk is able to generate and explain the DPR on a timely 
basis.  Also, while I am here I plan to meet with the Weather Derivatives 
team to assess their needs and gain an understanding of their markets.

This project will not drag on day-by-day as mentioned below.  There is much 
more that can be done, but that is out of the scope of this project; besides 
I am ready to come home.

Have a good weekend,

want to consider flying back with your family back to Houston, and then 
returning on your own to finish the project.  You could stay in a hotel from

Subject: Re: Move  

Mark,

It's good to hear from you. Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I 
didn't realize you were not aware of the situation. 

Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap 
a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up 
through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in 
London on May 8th.

Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat 
an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he 
had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more 
week, to May 15th.

Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 11, but apparently his 
plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend 
since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now 
wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.

Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S. 
the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize 
my plans around his leaving on May 11, and he relocate to a hotel if he 
needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out 
with him instead of returning early.

Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out  date to him, I guess we work 
around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 22 
as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may 
continue to drag on day-by-day.

Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and 
Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how 
strict ""two full working days"" is, we may actually need for him to be out no 
later than Wednesday, May 17--or even Wednesday, May 10.)

Cheers,
Tom x33926

Management's(Counterparty, Contracts, Facilities, Rates, Entelligence) role 
in the development and support of central information regarding excelr's 
customers and relationships and plans for expanding that role will be 
discussed.  Many topics will re-inforce worldwide initiatives, communication 
between business units, and learning to leverage knowledge and expertise from 
multiple sources. There will also be a special workshop session on 
multi-cultural awareness to prepare our teams for working in a global 
environment.  

And then you say.....
""Mary and I would like to feature you as a distinguished speaker, so you may 
relate to Mary's team and conference attendees why consistent global 
information is so important to excelr.  What value does constancy of 
information bring to excelr....how will this information serve excelr ?  We 
would like you to inspire us and influence us to meet excelr's diverse set of 
challenges.    Take the freedom to express things you have learned and think 
are valuable lessons to share with others.  
We have guest speaker spots available on the following days and times

June 15  - 1:30 - 1:50                or 2:10 - 2:30                        
or 2:30 - 2:50

June 16 - 11:00 - 11:20 (before lunch)                       or 12:30 - 12:50 
(after lunch)

I would like to have you be the final keynote speaker on Friday, 6/16 from 
3:15 to 3:45 or so (time for questions).  After that there will be some door 
prizes, the video presentation, and a brief conference summary.  Then it's 
off to excelr Field !  We would be delighted to have you attend all of the 
conference, but if your schedule will not permit, we would love if you could 
remain with us throughout Friday afternoon and accompany us to excelr Field 
for a social event in the Diamond Club.

I appreciate your efforts to secure meaningful and well-respected speakers 
for this year's conference.  If you need assistance from me, just let me know.

Subject: Global Rates

I thought I would share with you my ideas in regard to my upcoming trip to 
London.

I would like to meet with you and James New for about an hour when I first 
arrive to get a feel of your businesses and to give both of you an update on 
the new and improved Global Rates Group.   I would also appreciate it if I 
could unobtrusively sit with several of your risk groups in order to among 
other things, get an idea of the types of commodities London trades and their 
respective Exchanges and to become familiar with the current process that 
London uses to capture commodity rates.  

After a couple of days, I am confident that I could have an idea of how 
Global Rates could be of the most benefit to London.

This trip would of course be charged to the Global Rates CC and not allocated 
back to London, since it is a ""discovery""  trip, which we have budgeted for 
in our 2001 budget.

I wouldn't want this to interfere in anyway with your ongoing business, 
therefore would you please let me know when you and James would be in London 
during the next couple of  weeks and I will schedule my trip accordingly.

Thanks again for your assistance, it is unfortunate that our teleconference 
scheduled for today got cancelled.

Just want to provide a summary of our discussion on Wednesday, 4/19/2000 
regarding the analyst program and the conclusions reached.

Discussion item #1:  Similarities and differences between the commercial and 
commercial services analyst position.  Concluded that the only difference 
between the two analyst profiles is the difference in merit and bonus 
compensation.  Both have the opportunity to rotate across commercial and 
commercial services areas, return to business school after two years, stay 
and be promoted either to a commercial services professional position or take 
a commercial route and ultimately be promoted to associate.

Agreed:  There is one analyst program and we will immediately eliminate the 
compensation differences.  All analysts will receive the same 5K yearly merit 
increase and be eligible for the commercial bonus range.

Discussion item #2:  Morale of analysts in program.  Due largely to 
compensation differences making the program feel as though it is still two 
separate programs.  Commercial services needs more attention and focus.  Need 
someone of a Celeste Roberts calibre to focus on the staffing piece.

Agreed:  Eliminating the compensation differences will help boost morale.  
Additionally, there needs to be more focus and attention paid to the career 
development of analysts.  

Discussion item #3:  UT Spring recruiting.  Did not feel there were enough 
events and concerned that executive leads were not asked to participate.

Agreed:  Celeste Roberts will follow-up with George Hope and Shelly Jones to 
confirm number of events and whether dates were booked on executive lead's 
calendars.  Bottom line, we want to ensure that presence on campus is not 
minimized.

Discussion item #4:  Off-line discussion with Sally Beck regarding the 
Performance Review Process and whether all analysts would be reviewed as one 
pool

Agreed:   Per Sally Beck it was agreed that all analysts would be reviewed 
together.  We will not separate commercial from commercial services but will 
put all analysts on the table and review as one analyst pool.

 Please let me know if there are additional items that need to be captured.

daily to ensure best practices throughout all services provided.  We recently 
decided to consolidate the Risk Management, Deal Validation and Operational 
Analysis functions into one group, directed under the management of a 
Business Controller.  I am pleased to announce that Steve Venturatos has 
accepted the role of Business Controller for Texas/Upstream Operations, 
reporting to me.  Additionally, Dave Baumbach has agreed to serve as the Lead 
of the group.  Other additions to the group include Jody Crook, a first year 
analyst, and Ami Chokshi.  Ami will continue to serve as the account manager 
for both Entex and TUFCO.  The attached oranizational chart identifies all 
team members.  Additionally, the Denver trading books will be transitioned 
from Will Kelly (who is assuming the Business Controller role for the East 
region) to our group.  We will also be working with Keith McIver and John 
Peyton to establish risk books for the drilling day rate trading anticipated 
to kick off soon.

Mike Eiben has assumed responsiblities previously managed by Steve Venturatos 
which include Global Contracts and Facilities, System Enhancements and 
Regulatory Reporting.  Clem Cernosek will be joining the Logistics team in a 
trouble shooting capacity.  Jennifer Pattison will be joining Volume

Additionally, Will Kelly will transition the Denver trading books to the 
Texas team as he moves to the East Region.  Transportation Management under 
Mary Smith will NOT be integrated into the team as their day-to-day

GBN Steering Committee Meeting, 09 April 2000
May 17th Speaker - no sponsor.We decided against having a cover charge and to 
use GBN funds. We felt a cover might reduce attendance and wanted to keep the 
speaker series free for attendees. A $10 cover wouldn't cover all of the 
expenses anyway and we felt it would create a bad impression. Deed Vest of 
Rockwell International has confirmed availability for the date. Carolyn is 
handling the set up.

will be a GBN event, but we will invite the TBN.

June 25th Astros night v. San FranciscoAccording to Chrissy, the plans 
include a ticket to the? game, dinner at Zydeco's and a trolley ride from 
Zydeco's to the new excelr field. All this for only $25/person! Chrissy, if

I wanted to forward the latest update for the Book-Split Project.  Although 
you may not find the details of the update to be that exciting, I want you to 
know that much work and time are being put into this effort.  Paul and Gregor 
are the two Desk Directors for Continental Power who report to Joe Gold.  
It's good to hear some feedback from them.

As you know, Kristin has now shown some interest in the EBS job with Barry 
now that Fallen is moving.  When Barry and I first spoke about the position 
which I would fill, I told him the Fallen might want Kristin since he knows 
her and has worked with her the last 2 years.  Although the job sounds 
interesting (Barry's a good salesman), there is not room for both Kristin and 
myself.  I'll keep you updated on my discussions with Barry.

Thanks for being a sounding board,

Due to the announcement that the London office received pertaining to the May 
Day problems which occurred last year, the Book-Split ""Go Live"" date will be 
postponed until next Saturday, May 6.  Listed below are the updates since the 
last memo:

BOOK-SPLIT

Completed
Position report which presents peak/off-peak volumes by month, by desk was 
delivered to Paul and Gregor
Deal summaries which support the position report were also delivered
All volumetric variances between the Production and Test environments have 
been identified - the material differences were related to 2 counterparties 
which were not set up in Test and steps have been taken to resolve this issue
Discussed system changes relating to the Settlements invoicing system

Uncompleted
Test the PCS calc to ensure that it can report by desk
Separate DPRs and associated reports for the Pool and Bilateral portfolios
Testing of the Settlements invoicing system


TRANSMISSION

Talks have continued with the Houston IT team as to the Transmission deal 
type testing that must be done.  The IT group moved floors yesterday and has 
spent much of today recovering from the aftermath.  They are aware of the 
sense of urgency and level of priority to give this issue and considerable 
progress should be made during the next 2 weeks.


OTHER

Neil has been working with Miles in order to set up the necessary Cezch 
border curves so that the CEZ deal may be properly booked in Enpower.  Once 
this is complete, the Basis adjustment  (approx. 14M Eur) can be removed from 
the DPR.  Also, the Financial Iberian positions have successfully been 
intergrated into the current Continental Power DPR (leaving only the Spanish 
physical deals being valued outside of Enpower).

Example:

 Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.  He will be 
transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce 
assumes his responsibilities for EBS.  The current trading staff for EBS will 
report to Barry effective with his start date in May.

a status update.

BOOK-SPLIT

Completed
Separate Cash & Term books have been setup in Enpower and Global databases 
for every country
Pablo Pissanetzky has written code to successfully transfer over 99% of the 
deals into their proper regional books
Two dozen deals (mainly annuities) have been modified in Production to 
transfer according to Pablo's code
All deals requiring manual intervention on Go Live date have been identified
Initial position report has been developed and tested for accuracy

Uncompleted
Communication to Commercial of positions (Wed. April 26)
Presentation of the Position Report which allows Commercial to view monthly 
peak/off-peak volumes by region (Wed. April 26)
PCS by deal for each portfolio
Separate DPRs and associated reports for the Pool and Bilateral portfolios
Modifications necessary for the Settlements invoicing system


TRANSMISSION

We are making progress on this effort although you have not seen any hard 
evidence.  Zhiyong Wei is the IT Director in Houston who is responsible for 
Enpower development.  We are working with Pablo and Zhiyong on several 
possibilities.  As we have previously discussed, there is not the current 
capability to value the spreads as options, but we are testing the other 
scenarios. 

Buy/Resale
This deal type has been disabled
We are waiting for Zhiyong's response as to its future functionality if any

Transmission
Pablo tested in the Stage environment today after receiving minor assistance 
from Zhiyong
Ability to book Transmission deal without Annuity leg
Ability to liquidate demand charge daily
Reflects long and short positions at the appropriate regions (as Forwards not 
Options)
Does not value the forward spread between the regional curves (still testing)
Variable cost treatment is still being tested

Forwards
If deep in the money, we could enter intra-desk/inter-desk deals to reflect 
positions and P&L 

Much time and IT development resources have been spent to make use of the 
Transmission functionality.  After speaking with Zhiyong, there evidently was 
a big push last year for the MTM of Transmission.  The latest version has 
been in the test environment for some time, but no one is currently testing 
it.  It will take some attention to test it properly and will not be complete 
by the book-split deadline.

As we established in our last meeting, the MTM of transmission is a separate 
project from the book-split.  Due to the complexity and amount of data 
involved in the book-split project itself, it is advisable that we 
incorporate the transmission second.  Further testing of the transmission 
will continue this week and by the end of the week we should have a decision 
on the most effective way to currently book transmission.

Hi Mary,

Here are the 2 posting forms with your name as dept. manager approver, 
Sally's name as VP approver and myself as requester to be forwarded to Linda 
Vargo for posting.  Linda suggested posting the positions internally for 5 
days and then posting them externally.  Although it would be great to get 
people on board from within the company, I think we should just get the 
postings out everywhere asap.

Also, Linda required the following questions to be answered:
Internal or external posting?  To be posted both internally and externally

Are these positions already budgeted? No, they will have to come from out of 
budget

Relocations costs to be provided? Relocation costs will be provided for 
Specialist and above positions but not for Clerk, Senior Clerk positions.  
The same also applies for agency fees, (yes to Specialist and above, and no 
to clerk/senior clerk).

Here are the postings to be approved by Sally.

Thanks,
Avril

obviously it's you.


We are pleased to announce that Barry Pearce, Vice President, will be joining 
excelr Broadband Services as Global Controller of Trading Support Operations. 
Barry, who will be based in Houston and report functionally to both Jim 
Fallon and John Echols, will assume responsibility for the on-going 
day-to-day control and development of EBS's trading support infra-structure.

Recognizing that EBS's increasing trading operations worldwide are ever 
expanding, there is a need to insure outstanding internal controls are in 
place for all trading and risk management activities, regardless of location. 
Barry's responsibilities with regard to Global Trading Support Operations 
will mirror those of other Controller functions throughout excelr. In this 
role, Barry will work closely with Sally Beck's Global Risk Management Group 
to insure that EBS is focused on best practice throughout the front and back 
office functions, including Risk Book Management, Deal Capture, Contract 
Administration, Contract Settlements and Trading Accounting. Barry's group 
will also help ensure operational systems are developed to facilitate the 
timely and accurate reporting of all trading activities and that key 
operational procedures and processes are implemented.   

Barry has been with excelr since 1992, when he joined the company from Arthur 
Andersen. Barry has spent the last five years in London playing an integral 
part in the development and success of the support operations of ECT Europe. 
He moves to EBS from his current job as VP, European Gas and Power Trading 
Support Operations. 

Please join us in wishing Barry  success in his new role.

Dorothy - 

Please advise Lisa that our expectation is that each Business Unit will 
largely have the final say in establishing office space standards for their 
workforce (as is the case today) .

Corporate may intercede only to the point that a Business Unit fails to 
design to a sufficient density (average sq. ft. per workplace) and does not 
meet minimum.  Hard policy has not been set but we expect to gain consensus 
from excelr's Executive Committee before detailed space planning begins.

deals/opportuntities for 2000 and to discuss any resource or organizational 
issues facing the unit.  Each trading organization will be asked to give a 
short market overview of their markets, identify three market or trading 
opportunities and discuss any resource or organizational issues facing that 
group.  Please submit your presentations to Kay Chapman no later than April 
28, 2000.  The agenda is quite agressive but we wanted to give everyone an 
opportunity to discuss their business.

A more detailed agenda and locations/times will follow shortly.

generally find it far easier to deal with each other than with foreingers.  
In some Japanese, this unease can lead to some unappealing attitudes and 
behaviors.

The Japanese maintain a very clear distinction between an individual's public 
and private faces, so that it is rare to catch them expressing hostile views 
of foreigners.  Nevertheless, every now and then, a politician's remarks will 
land him in trouble. 

You might find the enclosed article interesting.  By the way, Ishihara spent 
two weeks denying that he had done anything wrong and only apologized in the

      Ishihara acknowledges word was inappropriate 

                Yomiuri Shimbun

                Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara late Wednesday acknowledged in a 
statement
                that it was ""inappropriate"" for him to have used the word 
""sangokujin"" and
                said that he regrets having caused misunderstanding and 
hurting foreigners in
                general by using the derogatory term in a recent speech. 

                It was the first time that Ishihara had clearly admitted to 
having hurt foreign
                residents by using the word, which has discriminatory 
connotations.
                ""Sangokujin"" literally means ""people from third countries."" 
Yet it was used
                after World War II as a derisory term for people from former 
Japanese
                colonies, primarily Koreans, living in Japan. 

                On April 9, he told members of the Ground Self-Defense Forces 
in Tokyo
                at a ceremony, ""Atrocious crimes have been committed 
repeatedly by
                sangokujin and (other) foreigners who have illegally entered 
Japan. It is to
                be expected that they will riot in the event of a major 
disaster."" 

                Although he used the word to refer to those who have 
illegally entered the
                country, it had a different meaning from what he meant to 
say, he said. 

                ""I did not intend to hurt Korean or other foreign residents 
in Japan, and I am
                extremely regretful,"" Ishihara said in the statement, 
promising that he would
                never again use the ""inappropriate word,"" which is prone to 
cause
                misunderstanding. 

                On April 14, he expressed regret over his remarks, but 
stopped short of
                acknowledging the derogatory import of the word ""sangokujin"" 
and failed to
                apologize for having hurt the feelings of foreigners. 

                Wednesday's statement was made in response to demands from
                metropolitan assembly members of Minshuto (Democratic Party 
of Japan)
                asking that he retract his remarks and make a public apology. 

                Ishihara handed the statement to senior Minshuto members of 
the assembly
                after they held a meeting earlier in the day. 

                The statement, to which Ishihara will affix the governor's 
official seal, will
                become an official document. 

                Hidejiro Kawai, secretary general of the Minshuto group 
within the
                assembly, said, ""An official document carries weight, which 
will be
                tantamount to the governor's withdrawal of his remarks and 
apology,""
                indicating that the group will not take the matter further.

Team,

Great meeting yesterday.  Thanks for your participation.  There's lots of 
great things going on throughout the organization!

Below summarizes the key points of our April 19 meeting:

Executive Committee Update
Our meeting with the Executive Committe to provide an update on Vision and 
Values is scheduled for Monday, May 15 at 11:45 for 30 minutes in the 
Boardroom.  Presenters include George Wasaff, Craig Sutter, Kirk McDaniel, 
Dave Schafer, Brian Redmond, Dick Amabile, Rachael Tobor, Gina Taylor/Beth 
Tilney and Cindy Olson.   Each presenter is responsible for presenting the 
key points/accomplishments of their sub-committee.
Presenters, please review your section of the presentation and ""tighten"" it 
up.  Each topic should have ONLY 1 slide.  Submit your changes to me by 
Tuesday, April 26.  
An updated presentation will be emailed to the team by Friday, April 28.
During the week of May 1 - May 5, each V&V rep should meet with their 
Executive Committee member to provide an overview of what will be presented 
on May 15. 
Please provide any feedback as a result of these meetings to me by Monday, 
May 8.
Ken, Jeff, and Joe will receive the final presentation by Wednesday, May 10. 

Excellence Through Communication
Each Business Unit/Global Function provided an update on Action Plans and 
feedback to the ETC survey.  At a glance, all of the Business Units/Global 
Functions find value in the custom questions.  Also, mail lists for the 
October 2000 survey need to be updated and the ease of accessing the survey 
needs to be consistent across business units/global functions.
Dick Amabile will summarize the update and forward it to all of the members 
of the Task Force.
In the June V&V meeting, we will link up with the ETC survey team to begin 
discussions for the October 2000 survey.

Sub-Committe Updates
P&D
Please work with your business unit/global function to identify pilots.  
Please contact Kirk McDaniel (x368251) or Dick Amabile (x33972) with ideas 
for pilots.
The team is currently working the Ad Agency on how to communicate the 
benefits and use of this tool with employees.  
The team is also considering changing the name from Participation & Dissent.

Communication Training
Work continues to enroll vp's and above in the Executive Impact & Influence 
course.  As of 4/19, 179 people (54%) have enrolled in the course with 150 
(46%) people not currently enrolled.
The On-line Basic Communication course is on schedule with plans to offer the 
course to employees during the 2nd quarter of 2001.

Communication Tools
Results of the email survey and best practice interviews were communicated to 
the group.  Action items are currently being developed and implemented based 
on the survey feedback.

Internal Communication Campaign
The campaign will formally launch on May 8 with a voicemail from Ken Lay to 
employees.  We're also working on a short video of Ken to post on IPTV on the 
Intranet.
Elevator monitors will be installed in the elevators over the next 6-8 weeks 
with a target launch date of 6-18.  The monitors will display live video, 
corporate announcements, and Vision and Values messaging along with other 
employee communication.  

Best Companies Initiative
An analysis of excelr's 2000 survey results was presented.
An employee letter from the Office of the Chairman was recommended to be 
forwarded to those employees reaching career milestones (5, 10, 15, 20, 25  
years of service).  Please forward any changes to that letter to Gina Taylor 
by Friday, April 28.  

Thanks again for a great meeting.

discussed with AA (Sorrells, Grutzmacher and Brown) how the monthly BRM 
controller's meeting deliverables and database deliverables should be 
prepared.  The proposal I think we should recommend to AA is the following:

Opening and closing meeting with front line managers and discussion of all 
items, regardless of priority ratings (high, medium, low)
Report generated to the Business Risk Managers at the monthly controller 
meeting in the ""Project Doorstep"" style, incorporating existing controls and 
observations/action steps to be taken on the critical issues (those with a 
high rating) and identify responsible person(s) and target date
Follow up matrix report relating to the specific project audited in the 
manner consistent with the BRM database indicating priority ratings (the high 
issues should match the issues reported in the monthly controller meetings)
Eliminate the summary report that has typically be presented at the monthly 
controller meetings

Once the ""Project Doorstep"" style report presented by  AA is received at the 
monthly controller meeting, compliance will input the issues into the second 
database to enable the reminder notifications to be sent to the person(s) 
responsible for the action step.  In addition, a monthly progress report will 
be generated from compliance to the Business Risk Managers to show the 
critical (high) issues and implementation detail, if any.

It will be imperative that AA issue final reports on the projects immediately 
after they have been completed and deliver the matrix  within two (2) weeks 
after the monthly controller meetings to Compliance for inputting to the BRM 
database.  If this information is not received within the two week time 
period, compliance will notify the BRM's and AA of the deficiency.

It will also be necessary for you, the Business Risk Managers, to notify your 
front line personnel that they will be receiving the email notifications on 
action plans with specific target dates and with the expectation that the 
responsible persons will be expected to respond to the email with the status 
report of the issue.

If you are in agreement with this reporting plan, please indicate so in a 
return email message to me and I will coordinate all responses and 
communicate this to AA.  I feel that this process will provide the BRM's the 
necessary information that you have indicated you want to hear in the 
controller's meetings, including the candid discussions as well as provide 
compliance with the necessary information to maintain the database so the 
information is available for the corporate needs.

Subject: Unify AR -- SAP Plans


	

Two years ago excelr North America made a decision to use Unify AR for cash 
application rather than SAP AR.  We decided at the time that SAP AR would be 
kept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the 
business logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that 
Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  
I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.

Two Years Ago	Today
Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in 
place.	Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of 
existence of signed agreement.
Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.	Canada nets across 
counterparties.
Netting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain 
separate net statement process.	ENA considering netting physical and financial 
together.
All account coordinators were to apply their own cash.	Cash applied centrally in 
Power, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in 
physical Gas.
Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to 
facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.	Although gas 
settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this 
functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by 
financial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating 
cost of funds by commercial team.
The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line 
tool.	Old habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing 
data, rather than using the on-line functionality.
Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be 
classified as ""on account"", with issues tracked in a case management system.	Case 
management system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account 
coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.
The counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the 
counterparty/legal entity combination on the excelr invoice.	Given the number of legal 
entities excelr has, along with the number of entities our counterparties 
have, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash 
seems easier.
Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be ""settled"" with cash 
movement.	Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be ""settled"" with cash 
movement.

Converting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:
Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify
Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP
Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP
Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify

Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face 
two problems in Unify.  
Controls built into Unify are already obsolete.
Unify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net 
across products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) 
impossible.

Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no 
controls (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the 
automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable 
within SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at 
the time of finaling a payment in Unify.

To repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to 
SAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  
Please call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this 
decision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any 
additional time for consideration.

meeting on Wednesday morning.  I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so 
it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.  

Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became 
concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other 
supporters of the program.   Many of those expressing frustration are heavily 
involved in the recruiting process.   It is their commitment to both 
recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting 
talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program. 

I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would 
bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss 
them with you in a constructive manner.  Our intent is continued support and 
improvement of the program.   The meeting took place on March 28 and included 
the following:

 Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU

 Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT  

 Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida

 Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of 
Florida

 Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU

 Carolyn Barrett  EBS    

 Howard Selzer  excelr Global E&P 


Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:

One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an 
announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.  Not much 
materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be 
managed.  In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw 
that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and 
differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.  We 
feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program 
on campus. 

SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is 
impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an 
innovative company.  The July start date does not consider December graduates 
and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in 
May.  

Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed 
senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or 
communication about the program.   We hear rumors of ""tracks"", but no facts 
or details.  Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some 
had not.  

Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support 
staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily 
focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.

Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many 
of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join 
with you in some of your plans for the program.   We are concerned that 
decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum 
without what could be some valuable input from some of us.  

MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team 
and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on 
campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top 
candidates and the pride of participants in the program.  We feel that the 
focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and 
we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.

to discuss deal flow and communicate issues and opportunties - the Monday 
morning meeting and the Friday managing director meeting.  I would suggest 
that we eliminate both these meetings.  I would propose that we replace them 
with a single  Friday afternoon meeting from 2:30PM to 4:00PM. The business 
unit heads identified above would be invited.  At this meeting, I would 
expect less of a reporting focus and employ a more candid and detailed 
discussion of opportunities, problems and issues between the ""partners"" in 
this company.  It would include (i) a review of current DASH's, (ii) a more 
detailed discussion around the opportunities identified on the ""Hot Sheet"", 
(iii) a more candid discussion around the P&L and tactics required to meet 
overall financial targets and (iv) provide a forum to provide input into and 
communicate business strategies between the business units. In other words, 
employ the goals of the Friday managing director meeting with all the 
business unit leaders represented.

Given the religious holidays this week, there will be no meeting this 
Friday.  I would suggest that we have a regular Monday morning meeting next 
Monday and we will start this new forum a week from this Friday.  This 
meeting would be held in 30C1 and Monterrey, Calgary and Portland should be 
connected via video conference.  In order for this to work and be effective,  
the business unit heads need to be available and participate actively in the 
discussion.

If you have questions, comments or concerns do not hesitate to let me know.

problems during the transition of the reporting.  We did not receive access 
to the necessary systems before the transition date.  After reviewing the 
existing East Power hierarchy within RisktRAC, we determined that the 
portfolios were not properly defined to generate an accurate total VaR 
number.  It was then that RAC agreed  there were known problems they had been 
trying to resolve for some time.  We defined the necessary changes and 
submitted our requests to Risk Analysis and Reporting.  The fixes appear to 
have corrected those problems, and everything is in place on our side to 
provide the requested reports.  As needed in the future we may look to RAC to 
answer questions or send additional change requests to RA&R.  The transition 
would have been smoother if we were granted access to the appropriate tools 
at an earlier date and made aware of any known problems at that time.  Moving 
VaR reporting to our group has been and should continue to be a beneficial 
change because it is a direct product of the information we calculate on a 
daily basis.  Jenny.

I talked withTodd today, but we still don't have anything firm yet. He 
currently intends for his family to return to the U.S. sometime the week of 
May 8th with or without him. If that is the case, he himself should be able 
to be out before May 15 even if he has to relocate to a hotel. However, he's 
asked for another week to get things in order. 

We agreed to talk again next Tuesday, April 25, to nail down exact dates. Is 
this okay? Are there any constraints that require us to firm this up before

Barry just left me an urgent message for me to call him back to discuss his

you were vague!! Were you thinking local deal? He definitely mentioned ""expat

Any idea of why this move is taking place? He wants to bring UK people over

Dolores Muzzy, Celeste Roberts' assistant was attempting to schedule a 
meeting to discuss the Commercial Services program.  The reason that Dolores 
is trying to schedule a meeting is follows:
(1)  Celeste and I were scheduled to speak briefly at Rick's staff meeting on 
Tuesday, April 11th as we had at Cliff Baxter's on March 27th.  However, we 
were not going to have a significant amount of time and because the 
discussion may have been extensive, Rick agreed that it made more sense to 
schedule a meeting in which the Commercial Services program was the sole 
topic of discussion.

(2) You and I had exchanged voice mails on March 27th, immediately after 
Cliff's staff meeting where you indicated that you had a group of individuals 
who were involved in recruiting and who would like to meet with us regarding 
questions about the management of the program.  You indicated that you would 
facilitate scheduling the meeting.  However, given that I had not heard from 
you and Celeste had told Rick we would schedule a meeting, it seemed to make 
sense to combine the meetings since they would most probably include some of 
the same individuals and cover the same questions.

I have no problem with you facilitating the scheduling of the meeting as you 
expressed to Dolores.  However, given that we told Rick that we would 
schedule a meeting, we are just trying to make sure that it does not slip 
through the cracks.  We will attempt to be available whenever it is 
convenient for you and the group that you wish to pull together.  If you wish 
to schedule a meeting immediately, our availability is as follows:

Friday, April 14th from 2:00 - 5:00 p.m.
Monday, April 17th from 9:30 - 11:30 a.m.
Tuesday, April 18th from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. or 2:30 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.
Wednesday, April 19th from 9:00 - 11:30 a.m.

If these dates don't work please don't hesitate to suggest others.   We look 
forward to meeting with you.

Subject: Trading Track Information

As you know, we are working on an on-boarding process to get the trading 
track participants up to speed as quickly as possible in each of their 
respective rotations.  One of the methods of doing this is to have each 
rotational supervisor (you're one of them) put a few points together to 
present to each participant on the first day of their rotation with you (or 
someone in your group).  

For example:
What does you group do as a whole?  The Risk Management Group is responsible 
for providing information to the trading floor.  That information consists of 
positions,  p&l,  and other general information which may be needed by the 
floor throughout the day.  The information must be 100% accurate 100% of the 
time as the gas floor is taking positions based on the information they are 
given.  In addition,  all reports go to SR.  Management such as John Lavorato 
and Dave Delaney.

The participants need to know several logistics type things such as:
 where to sit
 User tips on the use of related business hardware (i.e. phone system, 
intercom, etc.)
 How long/when or if to take lunch: use your discretion.
 Expected working hours: Expect to be in the office no later than 8:00 and 
preferably by 7:30

It is also important to cover the expected learning criteria with the 
participants on their first day:
 able to work under pressure - You will be asked to provide reports and 
answers to questions on the floor quickly.  You will be expected to know and 
understand the information that you are giving.
 ability to handle multiple priorities - There will be times when you are 
faced with several tasks at once.  You will be expected to make quick 
decisions and understand which is the most important.
 meets deadlines - Everyday in Risk you have to meet a deadline.  The traders 
must have positions and p&l on their desks when they walk in in the morning.
 Excellent written communication - Your written communication will be in the 
numbers that you provide to the floor.
 Excellent oral communication - Again,  the traders will expect answers and 
expect them quickly.  You will need to articulate those in a fashion that is 
understandable.
 Effective interpersonal skills -  see above.
 Attention to detail - This is one of the most important considerations of 
the job.  Again,  all information must be 100% accurate,  errors are not 
acceptable.
 Team player -  You will be expected to work across all groups upstream and 
downstream to provide accurate information and solve related problems.
 Excellent organisational skills - speed and accuracy are a hallmark of the 
job,  therefore you will need to be organized at all times.
 Is a motivated worker -  self explainatory
 Excellent analytical skills - same
 Maintains relationships with traders -  The trader will be relying on the 
information that you provide him.  Therefore it is important that he trusts 
what you are giving to him and that you are always asking if they need more 
or better information.
 Effective time management -  self explainatory
 Competent in Excel -  Alot of the work we do is in excel.  It is important 
that you be able to navigate excel, as well as create efficiencies to make 
the job less prone to errors and to run more smoothly.
 Competent with ERMS - ERMS is the system that is used to maintain positions 
and p&l.  All deals flow through this system and all values related to deals 
come from this system.
 Competent with Risktrac - Risktrac is the system that tracks counterparty 
risk and Value at Risk.  I expect you to understand what each means,  what 
the limits are,  and how you can reduce and add to value at risk.
 Demonstrates knowledge of trading concepts - Work with the traders to 
understand why they are putting on the positions that they have.  Try to 
understand proper hedging strategies etc.

Each participant who comes to your area needs to know your interpretation of 
each of these competencies so they can make sure to meet your expectations 
while in your area.

Also, the participants need to fully understand exactly what they'll be doing 
in your area.  Let 'em know with as much detail as possible.

Finally, Do you consider any information a pre-requisite for participation in 
your area ?(i.e. Advanced Excel skills...etc)
I'd like to know so we can push the participants to get the needed training 
before coming to your group.  Advanced Excel skills,  preferably a level of 
understanding of positions and value at risk.

Please compile this information and forward it to me so I can put it into 
some on-boarding material for all of the candidates by their first day of 
rotations.

The first candidates will begin on February 1, 2001.  

Thank you very much for you time and consideration.

It was a pleasure to meet with you on Tuesday, April 4 at UT to discuss my
qualifications for the excelr Scholarship.  It is a great honor to be
nominated for an award that is regarded so highly here in the business
school.  I believe as a nominee, and hopefully as a recipient, that I can
uphold the values that are at the core of excelr's business.
Again, thank you for the opportunity to share my ideas with you.  I look
forward to hearing the outcome.
Also, could you please pass along Gene's email address as well.  I am
assuming it is similar to yours, but I just wanted to make sure.

May 17th Speaker - no sponsor.
We decided against having a cover charge and to use GBN funds. We felt a 
cover might reduce attendance and wanted to keep the speaker series free for 
attendees. A $10 cover wouldn't cover all of the expenses anyway and we felt 
it would create a bad impression. Deed Vest of Rockwell International has 
confirmed availability for the date. Carolyn is handling the set up.

September 20th Houston's Economy Panel
Paul Murphy, Southwest Bank of Texas: confirmed with sponsorship
Shirley Delibero, Metro: unconfirmed, should hear something this week
Robert Duncan, Transwestern Real Estate: confirmed
Harvey Bunce, UT Galveston Med Center: unconfirmed
Technology: need someone. Roger, any interest at Compaq?
Energy: need someone. Sally, any interest at excelr?

Moderator: UT Professor Michael Brandl, Ph.D.

I will be contacting the TBN and see if they would also like to attend. This 
will be a GBN event, but we will invite the TBN.


June 25th Astros night v. San Francisco
According to Chrissy, the plans include a ticket to the? game, dinner at 
Zydeco's and a trolley ride from Zydeco's to the new excelr field. All this 
for only $25/person! Chrissy, if you have the info, let's try to get it on 
the May 17th event mailing.


Summer 2000 Family Event
Several members have expressed interest in a family event. Chrissy and I are 
looking into Theater Under The Stars (Miller Outdoor Theater). GBN will buy 
soft drinks and attendees will bring their own picnic dinner.

Next Meeting - Sunday, May 7th @ 4:30 pm at Guadalajara - the weekend before 
the Deed Vest event.

As you find out information for the events on which you are working, please 
email Chris and I to keep us up to date. Thank you for your help. Your work 
is appreciated.

Sally,

I wanted to give you a quick update.

I met with Fernley last Friday and we had a good discussion.  He wanted to 
know my initial assessment of the project and a rough time-line.  I admire 
the fact that he took almost 30 minutes of his time to show his interest in 
this project and myself.  I told him that it would be prudent for me to 
return a month after implementation of the book splits.  This way I can 
ensure that the processes and tools are in place and used by both the traders 
and the support staff.  If Brent needs some assistance at that time, I could 
stay for a 2-week span and meet two needs on one trip.

I spoke to Mark Tawney today and he welcomes my support on the weather desk.  
When I asked Mark about the impact of the traders leaving, he said that they 
are probably trading even more.  Tim Norton is meeting with Mark today and 
assuming things go well, he could began training almost immediately.

I'll try to call you tomorrow,
Todd

Paul,
While I think it is reasonable for you to request an increase to your limits, 
as you may know, the Board doesn't meet until May 2.  It would be somewhat 
unprecedented to leave a ""proprietary"" position over the limit for that 
length of time, i.e., the Australian Electricity book would far exceed the 
number of position limit violations for any other commodities.  I have left a 
message for Greg and will speak to Rick Buy today.  In the meantime, I 
suggest that you put together a request for approval to increase your limits 
to be presented at the first opportunity.

Hi Elyse - I just spoke with Ramesh Rao (associate dean).  He has not yet
made the Excellence Fund awards, which are also part of the excelr endowment.
He would like to have the dinner in the fall, when all of the awardees have
been chosen.  He felt that a dinner the end of April would conflict with a
major E-commerce conference we're having here, and the excelr awards would
get the attention they deserve in the fall.  The other advantage of a fall
dinner is that the new students will be here, and if we have a big
announcement then, they can see what they have to look forward to.  Will
this work for you?  Thanks.  Sue

they have been chosen.  If you don't mind seeing who from the university is

Thanks, Sally, for the update.  The only day that Rick is available is 
Monday, April 24 - this definitely limits us! I've asked Sharron to find out 
if others can't make it on the 24th (the recipients, Dean May, interviewers), 
would he rather have it on another day that week without him or have it in 
the fall once school starts again. Sharron will let me know what Rick says 
today.  Then, I'll call Sue White to start getting the ball rolling with 
schedules on campus.  I've tentatively booked Jeffrey's private room again 
for the 24th.

Do you want me to notify the winners?  I'm happy to do so.

Subject: Re: excelr MBA Excellence Awards - Dinner  

We interviewed the 12 finalists in Austin yesterday.   Interviewers were Gene 
Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.  The four of us met this 
morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.  Based 
on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today 
with the names of the three suggested award winners.  I conveyed this via 
voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.  She had told me that her schedule 
would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow 
morning.  She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.  I would not 
anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue.  
However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients 
until after that conversation.  She will most likely then contact you to 
confirm their names.  I have phone numbers, addresses and e:mail addresses 
for all three, and I will provide you with those as soon as the official 
notification from the University takes place.  

Gene, Thomas and Roger are all interested in attending the dinner in Austin 
if schedules permit.  The week of April 24th is a good one for me for the 
dinner.  Obviously, many schedules have to be coordinated.  I know that Rick 
Causey will want to attend (he will have been in London the week prior, so he 
may be available).  I have also talked with CIndy Olson and I know that she 
would like to be included if her schedule permits.  

Today was Brent's last day in the Houston office for several months.  Let me 
know how I can help with these arrangements.

Subject: excelr MBA Excellence Awards - Dinner

Sue:  Greetings!  We have not spoken in awhile, but I wanted to touch base 
with you regarding the MBA Excellence Awards and specifically hosting a 
dinner similar to last year's event at Jeffrey's.  I am expecting a baby in 
two weeks, so I'd like to get as much of this planned now as possible!  Amy 
Lee, Charla Stuart and Ali Saler who work in my group will pick up any of the 
pieces that I don't get to prior to becoming a mom, and one of them will 
attend the dinner in Austin.

I have a number of questions:  First, have the award winners been chosen?  
notified? What are their names/phone numbers? Can you help us with the guest 
list from the university?  How does the week of April 24 look on the 
university's calendar?  If we can't find a date before the school year ends, 
we could have the dinner during the beginning of the fall semester, but I'd 
like to try for the end of April/beginning of May.

I would like to use the Josephine House at Jeffrey's Restaurant again - it 
worked well last year, but I haven't called them yet - waiting to hear 
answers to the questions above...

Have a great day!  I can be reached by email or phone at 713-853-0565.

Subject: Junior Achievement & excelr

Cliff Baxter is representing excelr on the Board of Junior Achievement.  One 
of the programs that he would like to continue at excelr is the Job Shadow 
program.  This program entails a half-day commitment once per month beginning 
with the fall school semester.  The high school students are first given an 
overview of excelr and then a tour of the building.  The students then spend 
approximately 1-1/2 hours directly with individuals within specific 
departments.  Cliff would like to have as many departments as possible 
participate since this may be the only exposure these students have to the 
business world.

Please advise if you are willing to have your department participate, who 
your contact person is, and how many students that you would like to host 
each time.

Thank you for your consideration.

As we discussed on Friday, I think that there is merit to your arguments 
regarding the release in prudency in North America.  However, this may alter 
the way we articulate the relative liquidity of our positions to banks and 
ratings agencies.  De facto, we will be saying that our balance sheet and 
income statement reflect an ability to liquidate gas and power in North 
America at the mid with no adverse effects.  While this may be true, 
typically these types of institutions see the result of liquidating much more 
liquid portfolios, i.e., they will not believe that we have perfect 
liquidity.  I believe that we can satisfy both accounting and credit 
considerations if we maintain an ability to calculate an ""orderly 
liquidation"" under a negative pricing scenario (basically, multiple horizon 
VAR against a liquidating position).  This is what we showed Moody's last 
month.  The main difference is that the resulting number will be a hit to p&l 
as opposed to having reserves against it.  This is a long way of saying that 
I think it would be a good idea to discuss prudency methodology with both RAC 
and Treasury once you have finalized a course of action.

 I tried to get on your calendar but you are busy this week so I decide to 
send you a very important e-mail. You told me to contact you if I was ever 
considering leaving my current job so I am doing so at this time. I want to 
say that I have thoroughly enjoyed working with you and you are the most 
impressive employee at excelr at any level. I feel comfortable speaking with 
you and appreciate all of your advice. I am not totally unhappy with the 
recruiting part of my job, I just feel that I do not ""buy into"" everything 
that is happening in my group. There are many necessary changes that are 
needed and I feel that the program is heading in an excellent direction. I 
just want to get into more of a sales oriented part of excelr because I feel 
that my strength is selling. I would like to at least get an interview with 
excelr Broadband because I know that they are filling up there retail sales 
groups. Although I do not have all the technical experience, I know people 
who have gone over there with no technical or no sales experience. As you 
know, it is who you know and I do not have a relationship with David Cox or 
any of the
retail folks in broadband. I was hoping that you would give David a call and 
see if he could at least give me an interview in one of the retail groups. 
Brent has called over to David and I feel if you were to call also, it would 
help.
 Sally, let me know if this will be ok and I would like to get on your 
calendar to discuss further. Nobody in my group knows that I am looking for 
another job so please keep this confidential. I can not tell  how much I 
value your opinion and advice in matters especially  like these. Thank you so

Subject: EOL for Japan

As you are probably aware, we are looking at a roll out time for bringing the 
international commodities on EOL to Japan before the end of this month.  We 
have planned for a public rollout between 10-12 May.  The mailout for this is 
expected to be sent out the third week of April.

As all the products initially posted will be handled through the Singapore 
books, we need to make sure everything is in line.  We will not be offering 
any domestic products until probably third quarter.  Legal has been reviewing 
the nature and form of the Japanese law and has found that in its current 
form we should be able to roll out the system without too much difficulty.  
We will be using standard international contract forms which you would expect 
the cp's in Japan to be comfortable with.  In addition to your support for 
the range of petroleum products, Sydney will also quote your USD prices in 
Yen.  I spoke with Hickerson last week and they are making preparations for 
this.  With Sydney only 1 hour ahead, this allows Shane to provide real time 
support throughout the business day in Japan.

I would suggest that we have a call in the next day or so to further 
discuss.  Would tomorrow at 2pm Sydney time work?  I believe that this is 
noon your time?  If this doesn't work let me know so that we can adjust.

thanks,

Joe

 Telecom Companies Mtg To Discuss Bandwidth Trading
 By Michael Rieke
   
 03/23/2000 
 Dow Jones Energy Service 
 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

 HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A group of telecommunications companies is meeting 
Thursday to open discussions
 on industry standards for bandwidth trading. 

 Set up by CompTel, a Washington, D.C., trade association that represents the 
competitive telecommunications
 industry, the meeting will initiate discussion among companies that are or 
probably will be active in a nascent
 bandwidth trading market that could be worth billions or trillions of 
dollars a year.

 Bandwidth is the capacity to move data over telecommunications networks. 

 Russell Frisby Jr., president of CompTel, told Dow Jones Newswires that the 
trade group's members asked it to
 get involved in the discussion of bandwidth trading. 

 The fact that CompTel is involved in discussion on bandwidth trading shows 
that people are taking the idea
 seriously, said Steven Kamman, a telecommunications analyst with CIBC World 
Markets. 

 ""This year bandwidth trading will move from a theory to practice,"" he said. 

 Before that can happen, the industry needs to set ground rules for trading, 
and that will be a major topic of
 discussion at the meeting. 

 It comes as no surprise that excelr Corp. (ENE) will be at the meeting. For 
nearly a year, the company has been
 promoting the idea of setting up a liquid market for trading bandwidth under 
standard terms and conditions. 

 Tom Gros, vice president of global bandwidth trading for excelr, has two 
items he thinks should be at the top of
 the meeting's agenda. 

 The first is establishing an industry organization to set the standard terms 
and conditions for trading bandwidth as
 a commodity. The second is setting a North American benchmark for trading. 

 The bandwidth trading organization, or BTO, should consist of companies 
""with actual financial risk"" in
 bandwidth trading, Gros said. That means the group would consist mainly of 
major telecommunications carriers,
 the bandwidth producers. 

 But others also have financial risk in bandwidth, he said, including some 
major Wall Street players and bandwidth
 consumers. 

 Gros said some Wall Street players have already begun trading bandwidth, but 
he wouldn't identify them. A
 source with a Wall Street investment bank, who didn't want to be identified, 
said Gros's claim was a stretch. 

 Banks with trading operations are consumers, using telecommunications 
bandwidth to move stock market and
 commodity trading data internationally among offices, he said. But they 
aren't actively trading bandwidth as they
 do established commodities. 

 Major consumers of bandwidth would include large Internet service providers, 
or ISPs. Gros said they should
 also be included in the BTO. 

 Before bandwidth can be quickly and easily traded domestically, the market 
needs a North American benchmark
 that sets technical specifications, Gros said. 

 In domestic crude oil trading, the benchmark is West Texas Intermediate, 
which must meet standards for
 American Petroleum Institute specific gravity and for sulfur content. 

 In the bandwidth market, standards would be set for quality-of-service 
issues like errored seconds, severely
 errored seconds and unavailable seconds, Gros said. Those standards would 
cover corruption of data
 transmitted over bandwidth as well as the availability of bandwidth. 

 excelr has suggested that the benchmark cover the route between New York and 
Los Angeles, which ranks
 among the routes with the most data traffic in North America. 

 Agreeing on standards will be the toughest job to accomplish at the meeting, 
said Ken Epps, senior vice
 president for strategic marketing for Williams Communications Group (WCG), 
which will also be represented at
 the meeting. 

 The technical standards for bandwidth trading can't be set so high that they 
limit the number of companies that
 will trade, Epps said. If the standards limit liquidity, the market won't 
develop. 

 ""Everybody needs to walk away feeling that it's a standard they can live 
with, that they can build their business
 around,"" Epps said. 

 That goal can be met - it's just a question of how long it will take, he 
said. ""I don't expect it will be settled at the
 first meeting of the CompTel group, but it will be the kickoff."" 

 Williams plans to keep those discussion going next month at its own ""carrier 
forum"" to discuss bandwidth trading
 standards, Epps said. 

 About a year ago, when excelr first proposed trading bandwidth as a 
commodity, Williams officials were quoted
 as being skeptical about the idea. 

 But last month, the company announced it would take a leading role in 
developing a market for trading
 bandwidth. The Williams carrier meeting shows that the company is now 
serious about bandwidth trading. 

 Williams is inviting ""the real players, the MCI WorldComs (WCOM), the Qwests 
(Q), the AT&Ts (T),"" Epps
 said. ""It's about people who have the assets and how we use these to 
advantage the marketplace, how we build
 a good powerful market model."" 

 CompTel's Frisby, excelr's Gros and Williams's Epps wouldn't discuss which 
other companies were attending the
 meeting in Washington. But Dow Jones Newswires was able to obtain a list of 
attendees. 

 Among the invitees are companies with experience trading energy commodities 
- Dynegy Inc. (DYN); El Paso
 Energy Corp. (EPG); Columbia Transmission Communications, a unit of Columbia 
Energy Group (CG); and
 Koch Industries, which has investments in energy and telecommunications. 

 A surprise on the list is MCI WorldCom. Some industry sources have said the 
company opposes the idea of
 bandwidth trading under standard terms and conditions. 

 An industry analyst, who didn't want to be identified, said MCI WorldCom's 
participation in the meeting is
 indicative of changing attitudes in the telecom carrier industry about 
bandwidth trading. 

 Retail marketing groups within telecommunications carrier companies don't 
like the idea of a liquid bandwidth
 trading market, the analyst said. 

 Such a market could turn retail customers into wholesale customers. For 
example, a retail customer like an ISP
 could go to a liquid bandwidth market and buy at wholesale prices, he said. 

 Also on the attendee list are telecom carriers Teleglobe (TGO) and Global 
Crossing Ltd. (GBLX); NTT
 America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.; 
and Progress Telecom, a unit
 of the electric utility Florida Progress Corp. (FPC). 

 Also on the list is recent IPO Universal Access Inc. (UAXS), a company that 
matches carriers that have excess
 capacity with carriers that need extra capacity. 

 LighTrade, a start-up company setting up pooling points to allow bandwidth 
trading, was also invited. 

 Commodity traders are represented by Sakura Dellscher, Amerex, Prebon 
Yamane, AIG Telecom and the New
 York Mercantile Exchange. 

 Two consulting companies, Andersen Consulting and PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
were also invited. ",Non Abusive

Below is a summary of our activities this past week

Accomplishments:
Delivered workshops at NEPCO
Gained agreement with NEPCO on status of showstopper reports
Scheduled India' s workshops for next week
Rolled out (to NEPCO) the user manuals developed


Upcoming:
Complete gathering of data points and begin to layout longer term strategy 
(Elaine and Kim)
Develop additional workshops (design and data flow, consolidations and 
intercompany)
Develop and deliver second evaluation
Roll out manuals to user group in Houston 


Where are we at?
We should be able to ask more specific questions in our follow up evaluation 
to get better data on what specifically they don't like about the reporting 
out of SAP but as a rule so far we have consistently heard the issue of 
management quality reports, ability to pull data from across modules (ie. HR 
and PS data) and I can't get the data the way I want to see it therefore I 
don't understand what the data is telling me. 

This last point will be helped by these workshops (ability to view the data 
in mulitple ways) but only to the extent where people use the tools available 
and spend a little time to work with the system.  The design sessions 
(upcoming) should help address some of these questions aswell - one big 
learning from this has been that the majority of users do not understand 
their business unit design or the overall design and therefore can't figure 
out what the system data is telling them.  This is being addressed in the 7/1 
training plan and will also be addressed in the long term reporting strategy.

myself.

Subject: Project ""Q""

Hi,

I'd like to summarise the various discussions that have taken place over the 
last few days in relation to our forthcoming Logistics project, which I've 
tentatively named ""Project Q"". At some point a prize will be awarded to 
whoever can guess what the ""Q"" stands for...

Objective

Project ""Q"" has a twofold objective:

1) Implement the Co-ordination function for the London and Helsinki Global 
Trading Support group - see attached for a definition of this function 

2) Roll out the Products Inventory Management System (""PIMS"") for the London 
and Helsinki Global Trading Support groups.

Target Timescale

Completion of both objectives is currently planned for the end of May. David 
and I have hastily put together a timeline which we will refine as a group at 
a Kick-Off meeting scheduled for next Friday, by which time the project team 
will be assembled in London - see attached .

To meet this tight timeframe, the scope of the project needs to be clearly 
understood especially in relation to rolling out PIMS. Though over time 1) 
functionality may be added to PIMS, 2) there will (hopefully) be a further 
deployment in Houston and Singapore, 3) an interface to RightAngle may be 
developed, 4) invoicing may be added etc... - for the purpose of this project 
the scope of the PIMS application is limited to replacing MANIPS for the 
Helsinki and London Operators (Petchems may or may not be included in this 
phase). The actual PIMS specification will be finalised next week by Graham 
and David (IT are currently mid-way through a full elaboration for the 
system).

Project Team

Steering group will comprise me (also Sponsor), Graham and Becky.

Project Manager is Cindy (arriving from Houston on Tuesday).

IT lead for PIMS is David Rae (full time for duration of project), managed by 
Iain Greig.

A Task Force comprising three contract accountants is being assembled and 
will be in place by the middle of next week.

Other stakeholders/key participants in this project are Logistics in London 
and Helsinki. The result of this project should be to leverage our existing 
operators and improve controls by introducing a second tier support around 
the Logistics function. However, for this to happen a significant 
contribution will be required from all our Operators to ensure a successful 
implementation within our timeframe.

Regards,
Tim

Subject: Global Entelligence Status

Just wanted to let you know a few updates:

1) We have a full IT team now ready to go.  We are going to prototype the 
first window, Market Penetration.  The prototype will give us something with 
sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on 
functionality.   Hopefully, we will have something in 2 weeks.

2) The previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from 
the prototype.  The estimates are $1.6M for phase I and $1.6M for remaining 
phases.

3) Included in the cost estimate is a figure of $ 389K for the purchase of 
customer prospect data from Dun & Bradstreet.  The $389K is an O&M expense 
amount that was not included in the 2000 budget.  This amount combined with 
other amounts ENA did budget for or will spend with D&B results in an overall 
budget impact over the next 12 months of $278K.

I spoke with George Wasaff in Strategic Sourcing this morning at the request 
of Philippe Bibi.  George has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from 
D&B.  Either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate 
better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with D&B.  This 
could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready 
to go for implementation.  I believe I can give George some time to try 
something, but when it comes down to it, $389K isn't that much money.  
Therefore, I suggest that if we don't have anything negotiated in the next 
three weeks, we sign the current proposal from D&B and move forward.    D&B 
is currently threatening (a negotiation tactic, I think) to pull their 
development resources off of this project until they receive a signed 
agreement.  In the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our 
delivery of Global Entelligence, we can provide a letter of intent to keep 
them moving or sign the proposal at that time.

Give me a call at 3-6079 if you have any comments on any of the above items.

Subject: Supervisory Leadership Classes

By now, you should be aware of the Supervisory Leadership Curriculum rolled 
out by Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago (see the posters in our elevator 
banks).  This curriculum was designed at the request of senior management to 
provide new and future leaders the opportunity to prepare for such roles.  
Feedback from the program administrators is that there has been a low 
response rate.  This may be due to confusion about eligibility and cost.  
Just to clarify - All of you are eligible to participate.  In fact, you are 
strongly encouraged to participate.  Further, those individuals within your 
groups that are leading efforts or are expected to step into such a role are 
encouraged to participate.  Please keep in mind that individuals don't 
currently have to be supervisors to attend the training; the idea is to 
provide training for new situations encountered as leaders.  Generally 
speaking, those at the specialist level and above should be considered for 
these classes - just use your judgment.  

Although there is a cost associated with these classes, it is minimal in 
comparison to the returns that can be gained through participation.  
Guidelines are available to help you target specific needs for yourself and 
your staff.  Please contact the training department to obtain a curriculum 
guide.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Susan

I need to be working on my newest project, for which we went to Hallettsville
this week, and tomorrow is Garden club, and I am almost through as president.
 I will not preside in April, as I have a conflict-new secretary in Colonial

Being presdent has not been too bad, as all of the ladies are very helpful.
My project is the completion of our papers for the recognition of our

Brenda, Vlady and I met today to discuss Project Door Step for Mariner.  
Since Mariner is an E&P company rather than a trading company (or so we 
think), I believe our approach may be somewhat different from the other 
trading reviews.  The review will likely focus on the company's risk 
management policies and procedures which we  think relates mostly to hedging 
oil and gas production.  Based on a review of the last Mariner 10-Q (Sept 
99), it appears the company does a significant amount of hedging with 
financial instruments extending out to 2002.  The company also has 
significant ($14MM) of deferred losses related to hedging activities.

As discussed with Ted, we have preliminary planned to visit Mariner on Tues. 
March 21.  As a starting point,  Vlady is pulling RAROC information related 
to Mariner and Brenda is getting all excelr positions with Mariner.  Please

I spoke w/Fernley Dyson,  CAO for EE and Barry's current boss, and he's 
supportive of Barry's transfer to our region to lead the 
accounting/commercial support efforts for your Tokyo office.  I also spoke 
with Barry, and he's excited as well.  I think it's a done deal.  
Scott/Michael - I told Barry one of you would contact him tomorrow to discuss 
the next steps re: a more standard expat package (not the 6 month situation - 
Causey approved a more standard longer term expat arrangement), and plans to 
move his family to Tokyo.

The issue we need to work out is transition, and I asked Barry to discuss 
that with you directly, Joe, and I told Fernley we'd obviously be flexible 
but we'd like him sooner rather than later.  Barry indicated the guy that 
Fernley just hired that Barry was going to be reporting to is going to start 
towards the end of April.  So I bet they're going to want some overlap there, 
which puts us into end of May before Barry could really move.  I think we 
should be able to accomodate this somewhat longer transition period with 
Heidi's help and with Carol from Houston if necessary, plus I told Barry we'd 
want him to make at least a couple of trips over to Tokyo in the interim so 
he can start getting involved even before he moves over there.  But it will 
be important for us to understand what specifically you want Accounting to 
accomplish by the end of May so Heidi and Carol can plan how to support those 
efforts while not infringing on Heidi's responsibilities and demands in 
Sydney.

Meanwhile, I've asked HR to contact Eugenio Perez, Sally's designee for the 
temporary Risk position, to begin those discussions, and Sally said she could 
address transition issues for him next week - she'll be in London 
(Scott/Michael - you should probably give her a call in the London office 
their Monday afternoon).  Perhaps we can get Eugenio over to Tokyo earlier 
than Barry.

Subject: Dinner Next Week

Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week.  Wanted to see if 
you, Frank and Mo might be available for dinner one evening.  We arrive on 
Monday morning (March 20th) and will return to Houston on Friday morning.   
Our Tuesday night is booked, having dinner with Fernley.  But Monday, 
Wednesday and Thursday are available.  Does it work for you with the baby to 
do evenings?  Let me know.

I have a potential house for you to see if you are interested. It is very 
large and is in a beautiful location right near Hampstead Heath. The current 
occupiers are moving out most likely at the beginning of April and excelr 
holds the lease until the end of June. The commute is approx 35 mins to the 
office.

It is in an incredible area and is very spacious with a large garden so I 
would recommend seeing it. Cost is o1400 p/w plus I would need to arrange 
furniture which would not be a problem. 

Are you interested and if so, can you see it on Tuesday afternoon? If so, 
what time would be best?

Sorry I can't offer it to you, Sally, but we won't have it long enough unless 
the landlord would allow us to extend which is a possiblity.

Subject: Killed EOL Deals

Sally asked that I forward the detail of the ""killed"" EOL transactions to 
both of you.  We have emphasized the importance of stressing to our customers 
that a deal transacted via excelrOnline is a binding/legal transaction, but we 
have continued to see a few of these deals occur.  In summary, we have had a 
total of 33 killed transactions since inception, the majority of which have 
been with Aquila (5), Koch (8), and internal trades (13).  Obviously, the 
ones that concern us the most are those transactions with third parties, and 
most of these have been due to claimed web latency and transactions not 
appearing on the customer's summary report.  It is important to stress to the 
Commercial team that the way to ""get out of a trade"" is to do an offsetting 
trade or have our Legal Dept prepare a termination agreement.  Please feel 
free to pass my name on to your respective groups as a point of contact to 
work with Legal in the case of a terminated deal.

1)  I just talked with Scott Earnest and asked him to send you and John 
Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore.  This draft 
now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he 
made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week, 
meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday.  You and John should receive 
those drafts today.  

2)  I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply 
to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was 
asking).  I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am 
there.    

3)  To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are 
the following:

Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide 
for you during this transition period
Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of 
the details on having support personnel in London 

Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for 
Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one 
(which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston)

Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is 
appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective 
trading operations and controls world-wide

Subject: Trip to London Next Week


Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday 
morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in 
regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick 
Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will 
provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during 
the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has 
hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the 
details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will 
also map out an excelr trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, 
which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a 
strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with 
Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael 
in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as 
possible.  

Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his  
business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we 
would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good 
ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all excelr 
locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were 
focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on 
leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading 
operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be 
generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  

I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as 
she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but 
I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.  
It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in 
Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading 
operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.  
I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and 
offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role 
over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as 
needed.  

I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to 
discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your 
business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  

This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are 
conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have 
taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be 
a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.  
The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of 
North American locations and some entities in the US in which excelr has a 
large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort 
in London will occur in mid April.  

Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to 
Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those 
drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business 
managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley 
suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final 
copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and 
Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip 
in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned 
the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I 
can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was 
pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was 
out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney 
and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to 
accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They 
understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.

Subject: Killed Trades


It has come to light that there have been a number of  excelrOnline 
transactions which have been ""undone"" after the fact.

These are situations in which an excelrOnline trade has been completed, but we 
have agreed verbally with the other party that the trade will be deemed not 
have happened and we may have suppressed generation of a faxed confirmation.

It is of great importance that we do not do anything which makes an 
excelrOnline trade appear as though it is not firm, or not reliable, or which 
affects the audit process.

Therefore, excelrOnline transactions must not be killed. 

Individual traders might elect to conduct an OTC transaction which has the 
effect of reversing the impact of an excelrOnline transaction - this activity 
is outside the scope of excelrOnline.

Please note that there has never been an instance in which there has been a 
system error on excelrOnline which caused a trade to take place which was not 
initiated by the customer. All instances to date have involved some kind of 
operator error, or failure to use the results of a Transaction Search to 
verify completed deals.

I am currently in the middle of selecting our Japan Banking Relationship and 
several questions have come up.

It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work.

I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about excelr Online and where it fits in with 
our banking.  excelr Online does not interface with the banking.  It 
interfaces with a trading system/accounting system?  What I need to know is 
what system is planned for excelr Japan's accounting for the trading.  The 
accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system.

What it boils down to, is the payment format that we will use to make local 
Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the 
Japanese  - English translation. The accounting system used will need to 
interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements, we will need 
to interface with the bank.  

  Please advise.

morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in 
regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick 
Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will 
provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during 
the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has 
hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the 
details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will 
also map out an excelr trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, 
which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a 
strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with 
Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael 
in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as 
possible.  

Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his  
business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we 
would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good 
ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all excelr 
locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were 
focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on 
leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading 
operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be 
generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  

I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as 
she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but 
I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.  
It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in 
Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading 
operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.  
I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and 
offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role 
over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as 
needed.  

I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to 
discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your 
business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  

This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are 
conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have 
taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be 
a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.  
The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of 
North American locations and some entities in the US in which excelr has a 
large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort 
in London will occur in mid April.  

Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to 
Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those 
drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business 
managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley 
suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final 
copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and 
Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip 
in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned 
the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I 
can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was 
pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was 
out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney 
and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to 
accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They 
understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.

I have two options available below. I have not seen these apartments, 
however, so would recommend that you both have a look when you arrive next 
week. Please let me know if you find these suitable. Neither of them are 
located in South Kensington or Chelsea but I think you will find that 
Kensington and Marylebone are also very nice, close to parks and high

Kensington High Street - We have a block of apartments here that offer
accommodation of a high standard. They will have a newly  refubished
spacious flat free with 3 bathrooms, 24 hour porterage, Mon-Fri maid
service, and an underground car parking space included.

Please however note that this flat will not be free until the 03rd or 04th

Conducted several workshops with EECC and the CALME region this week
Scheduled workshops with NEPCO
Have identified the needs to be addressed in the NEPCO workshops and are 
arranging appropriate resources
Met with the London COE to discuss their status in terms of reporting (we are 
sharing data from workshops)
Have made an initial offer to Corp HR cost center users to conduct workshops 
for them
Brought in some EY help to work with the business units to understand the 
multiple environments, extraction and analysis tools being used by the 
different business units

Upcoming:
Additional workshops for EECC and ESA
Identification of the Corp groups that would like to have these sessions made 
available (and subjects they would like to cover)
Will complete the ""user"" guides with screen prints to give out to all 
participants (step by step instructions, tools, and tips)
Finalize the NEPCO workshops (Mar 20-22)
Produce a plan for upcoming workshops for ECCS and Design review


Summary analysis of evaluations from this week's workshops:
Our overall belief is that the workshops, the one on one attention, the new 
content etc. are being received very well (scores averages around 3.5 on a 
scale of 1-4)
The score for the question of whether SAP will meet the reporting needs is 
still too low (average of 2.8).  We will continue to analyze the root cause 
of this problem.  
There is definitely an improvement in people understanding which modules 
contain which data.  We believe that a hand-out we developed really helped 
this and will continue to continue to emphasize this learning.

Comments received:
Very good and useful
Could have used this sooner
Sessions are not long enough
I love the workshop idea, its so much better than training classes

Feel free to contact me, Melissa or Kim with any questions or concerns.

Carol,

In my research for excelr Japan and trading with excelr Online I spoke with 
Dave Forester.  He explained that the settlements for excelr Japan would be 
handle by excelr North America and would be similar to OTC in Canada.

Would you be able to assist in getting a few questions answered concerning 
the trading?

Who will be handling the excelr Japan Trading settlements?
Will they by settled in USD?  and/or YEN?  What will be the banking 
requirements?
Will the wire transfer request for settlement be processed in Houston?  Where?
What will be the standard settlement terms?


Please advise.

Here are some statistics of Unify transaction, volumetric and CPU performance 
since December:

    Dec '99  Jan '00  Feb '00  Mar '00
Path count   4785  6325  8038  8227
 % change  n/a  32%  27%  2%

Peak Day Delivered Qty 15.4 Bcf  22.8 Bcf  20.3 Bcf  17.5 Bcf

This time period includes the Columbia Energy Services business during 
January as well as the Bridgeline merger during March.
The increase in paths from 4785 in December 1999 to 8227 in March 2000 
represents a total  transaction increase of 72%!
Over this same time period, CPU utilization has increased from the mid-teens 
to the mid-20s during 7am - 7pm peak interval (see graph below).
Real-time deal changes to Path Manager via Tibco was implemented on Jan 21.

We continue to monitor the Sybase performance on a daily basis and tune the 
application when possible.  We are also testing the new 64 bit version of 
Sybase 12.0 which was just released.  Although we have experienced some 
""stack traces"" on this new Sybase server, we are experiencing improved 
performance in our initial application benchmark tests.  We hope to migrate 
to this new OS and Sybase release in April.

Sally, thanks for considering Dan Houston.  I have attached his resume.  I 
have known Dan, both personally and professionally, for probably 15 years. He 
started in the early open access marketing company days as a gas accountant 
so he has good physical knowledge of the pipes and he, I think, has gotten 
good exposure over the last 5 years or so to the risk management side.  He's 
the last to be at Tauber and is wrapping up their gas trading business so he 
is needing to find a new home.  Again, thanks for the favor.  Let me know if

he knew of any other talented people at Fleming (his current employer) that 
we should know, he immediately suggested Tana.  His read is that she is very 
bright, creative, and innovative.  She has worked on many special projects at 
Fleming, but James believes that she would certainly consider a generalist 
role as she learned excelr and would then ""earn"" her way into managing special 
projects.  I thought that I would give ENA a first look at this candidate.

Thanks for calling last night.

I've spoken to Joe Gold (MD) and James New (my Power Director) and we will be 
delighted to have Todd over for a month.

We need him here for Monday 20th March - for 4 weeks - thru 15th April. Full 
Time. 

I guess he should plan to fly over next weekend to be here for the Monday - 
bright and early. The timing is crucial.

He would work jointly with Neil Tarling (Director) on the project - basically 
- to seperate the Continental Power Book into 4/5 regional books - complete 
with individual portfolio's, fully documented inter-book trades, currency 
functionality and control gates. He will be working with Traders, Comm Supp & 
IT.

I suggest Todd touches base with James - Project 'Lead' - to get some 
backgroung information about the market.

I think the 'Sally will pay' line swung it with the Commercial folks......I 
said we had a free option - we can always send him home....

Speak to you real soon.

Subject: Global Rates

I thought I would share with you my ideas in regard to my upcoming trip to 
London.

I would like to meet with you and James New for about an hour when I first 
arrive to get a feel of your businesses and to give both of you an update on 
the new and improved Global Rates Group, after the partial implementation of 
MKM.   I would also appreciate it, if I could unobtrusively sit with several 
of your risk groups, in order to among other things, get an idea of the types 
of commodities London trades and their respective Exchanges.  This would 
allow to familiarize myself with the current process that London uses to 
capture commodity rates.  

After a couple of days in your shop, I am confident that I could come back to 
Houston with a much better idea of how Global Rates could be of the most 
benefit to London.

This trip would of course be charged to the Global Rates CC and not allocated 
back to London, since it is a ""discovery""  trip, which we have budgeted for 
in our 2001 budget.

I wouldn't want this to interfere in anyway with your ongoing business, 
therefore would you please let me know when you and James would be in London 
during the next couple of  weeks and I will schedule my trip accordingly.

Thanks again for your assistance, it is unfortunate that our teleconference 
scheduled for today got cancelled.

26442,beck-s/all_documents/2499.,<32780147.1075855805785.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Just wanted to let you know a few updates:

1) We have a full IT team now ready to go.  We are going to prototype the 
first window, Market Penetration.  The prototype will give us something with 
sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on 
functionality.   Hopefully, we will have something in 2 weeks.

2) The previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from 
the prototype.  The estimates are $1.6M for phase I and $1.6M for remaining 
phases.

3) Included in the cost estimate is a figure of $ 389K for the purchase of 
customer prospect data from Dun & Bradstreet.  The $389K is an O&M expense 
amount that was not included in the 2000 budget.  This amount combined with 
other amounts ENA did budget for or will spend with D&B results in an overall 
budget impact over the next 12 months of $278K.

I spoke with George Wasaff in Strategic Sourcing this morning at the request 
of Philippe Bibi.  George has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from 
D&B.  Either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate 
better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with D&B.  This 
could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready 
to go for implementation.  I believe I can give George some time to try 
something, but when it comes down to it, $389K isn't that much money.  
Therefore, I suggest that if we don't have anything negotiated in the next 
three weeks, we sign the current proposal from D&B and move forward.    D&B 
is currently threatening (a negotiation tactic, I think) to pull their 
development resources off of this project until they receive a signed 
agreement.  In the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our 
delivery of Global Entelligence, we can provide a letter of intent to keep 
them moving or sign the proposal at that time.

Give me a call at 3-6079 if you have any comments on any of the above items.

Reporting
Live Users - A number of workshops have been conducted and are scheduled to 
be conducted to help users better understand how to get at information in 
SAP.  APACHI and South America users have had workshops; CALME and EECC are 
scheduled, and NEPCO/OEC are being planned.  Please contact me, Greg Nikkel 
or Kim Lesley to find out more on status.  Also, any feedback you have for me 
on the effectiveness of these workshops and suggested next steps will be 
welcomed.
4/1 and 7/1 Go Lives - Susan Bellinghausen and Emitra Nelson and the 
respective representatives from the Business Units are working to make the 
next to go lives smoother with respect to reporting.  Again, any feedback you 
could pass on to me, Kathy Kokas, or Susan regarding suggestions or concerns 
is appreciated.
Long Term Reporting Strategy - We are still looking to identify a lead person 
to head up the long term reporting strategy.  This would involve 
understanding any true reporting gaps, as well as the right processes and 
tools for closing these gaps.  In addition, the right degree of ""common"" and 
business unit specific reporting needs to be defined, and the degree to which 
reporting solutions are function-specific or cross functional (e.g., 
financial, HR, procurement, projects).

Close/Consolidations
Bob Butts and Jan Johnson have taken point to head up a group to review the 
consolidation and close process to determine how/when we get the process 
optimized.  Susan Bellinghausen has followed up with Bob to schedule the 
requested demos of ECCS vs Hyperion functionality.

F/X
I was requested to obtain resources to do a third party review of the overall 
effectiveness of our foreign exchange transactions as they flow through 
different modules.  I am meeting with Kimberley Scardino of Arthur Andersen 
this week to outline the assignement, and have obtained a commitment from SAP 
America to bring appropriate SAP expertise to the review.  We expect to 
complete this review in approximately 3 weeks.  The outcome would be a report 
on whether effective processes and controls are in place for f/x processing, 
and suggestions for how we could more effectively use SAP's capabilities in 
this area.

established a SWAT team to assist the business units in SAP reporting.  This 
is the first of weekly status reports that we will provide.

Purpose:  

The team has begun to hold small, interactive workshops with production users 
to:

Show users how to extract data from SAP by:
Using on-line inquiry
Using SAP standard reports and
Creating and modifying a variant
Educate users on the SAP data model and where business unit specific data 
resides in SAP (which module).
Better understand what additional reporting needs users may have.

Team structure: Lead:  Kim Lesley (consultant)
   PS:  Andreas Kraus (COE), Damon Willis (consultant)
   FI/CO:  Randy Parman (COE), Esther Cortes (consultant)
   Education support:  Maria Young (COE)

The structure of the team reflects the initial focus on project and financial 
reports.  It has been balanced to include COE support analysts who will 
provide long-term customer support plus SAP consultants with deep reporting 
knowledge.  We will adjust the team members as appropriate to address the 
material needed by the business units.

In addition to this team, Susan Bellinghausen and Emitra Nelson are 
continuing their efforts on 1/1, 4/1 and 7/1 report development.

Progress:

To date we have held 5 workshops with the Apachi and South American regions.  
These workshops have been evaluated across several criteria.  

On a scale of 1-4 (1 = not at all and 4 = absolutely), the workshops have 
received an average rating of 3.6 in learning reports and increasing comfort 
levels.  The workshops are definitely providing the one on one experience 
that the users are requesting.  They are also seeing and learning (hands on) 
various tools that are available to them to adjust the display of reports, 
query the data from each module and analyze the data.  The sessions are also 
helping to remove some of the fear associated with trying things in a new 
system by providing helpful tricks and hints from the experts.  

However, there is still a concern about increasing the understanding of where 
data resides within SAP.  This is reflected in the average rating to the key 
question ""can SAP meet your needs"" being only 2.5.  We will further explore 
why the users think this is the case and what they are not getting.   We are 
adjusting our sessions to address this and will continue to seek feedback.  

Upcoming key activities:

Schedule the remaining International region sessions and the EECC home office 
sessions.  We have the participant lists and are working on logistics.
Complete the analysis of the needs of the other business units in production.
Develop a process to follow up on these sessions to monitor the learning 
progress of the users.
Begin to evaluate a cost center reporting tool that excelr Europe has deployed 
in London.


I would like to thank the active participation of the business units in 
identifying and providing the right group of resources to the sessions.  If 
you have any questions or comments, feel free to address them to Melissa 
Becker, Kim Lesley or myself.

Inja,

Below is the revised detail items which reflect the open items from less than 
July 99.  It compares from Jan1st metrics to March 1st metrics.
The load to Unify comes from the 2 angels below.  The Mass Draft has the 
concern of statements not finalized for those periods, which the back end 
accrual & reporting has
the increased load of line items.

Front End process 
Mass Draft Process (load) - whenever any statement has not been finalized for 
a prior delivery period, it has to redraft for those deals.  Hence, redraft 
for every deal for that counterparty.

Back End processes
Accrual Process - The accrual extracts on a line item detail, which is 
stored, and reported on various reports.
GL Month Process - The GL Month Report extracts on a line item detail, which 
is reported from the ACRL and PDCLS perspective.

GAS Summary:  
    No of Line Items    No. of Line Items
    July 99 & Prior Month    since July 99

Inja,
As discussed, below is the Dec99 Accrual metrics, by delivery period.

Again, this increased history creates additional loads on:
mass draft process - having to redraft prior delivery periods
accrual process - increases the accrual time, reporting
retrieval, reporting, sending to MSA J/P.  Example, we are nearing 10,000 
line items alone of ACRL data for 016.
period close reversal - each month we send a offset reversal for every prior 
month accrual
overall data growth in detail tables to support prior months





This can be also seen by running the accrual reprint retrieve report, or the 
finalized transaction by gl month report (ACRL).

Dear Ms. Beck,

I am writing to you to express my interest in working for excelr.  I have
long been interested in a career in business, and I would love the
opportunity to explore business in excelr this summer.

As I have worked with the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club (HEC) and various
entrepreneurs association around the country to spearhead the effort to
form a national collegiate entrepreneurs organization, I have learned a
great deal about how organizations work and how to make them effective.
This theme of entrepreneurship has spilled over into my other activities as
well.  I am coordinating the first annual fundraising banquet for Christian
Impact to help us raise money for outreach events.  I am also co-leading
the first mission trip comprised of Harvard students this summer.  Because
this effort is taking me to Latin America for the first half of the summer,
I will be in Houston from mid-July to mid-September.  If there is a
position available at excelr, I would enjoy working for it while I am here.

I am excited about the opportunity to learn more about the business world.
The combination of resourcefulness, rigorous logic, and creativity called
for in the business sphere intrigues me.  The integration of global and
analytical thinking also piques my interest. I have attached my resume for
you to review, I will be in Houston from March 27-31 if you would like to
interview me. Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing
from you!

Sincerely,

Natalie Carnes

I am very impressed that so many customers have been motivated to make such

change of the decision that was made two year ago.  However, since all other 
excelr companies will be using SAP AR, there is a definite benefit in using 
the same system across excelr entities to simplify intercompany reconciliation 
and related SAP interfaces (i.e. cash application, netting, deposit load).   
Even though many Unify users did not want to give up Unify AR functionalities 
(since Unify has more flexibility),  we felt that it will be to everyone's 
benefit to have the entire company's AR in the same system.   Please see

Subject: Unify AR -- SAP Plans


	

Two years ago excelr North America made a decision to use Unify AR for cash 
application rather than SAP AR.  We decided at the time that SAP AR would be 
kept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the 
business logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that 
Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  
I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.

Two Years Ago	Today
Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in 
place.	Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of 
existence of signed agreement.
Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.	Canada nets across 
counterparties.
Netting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain 
separate net statement process.	ENA considering netting physical and financial 
together.
All account coordinators were to apply their own cash.	Cash applied centrally in 
Power, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in 
physical Gas.
Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to 
facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.	Although gas 
settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this 
functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by 
financial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating 
cost of funds by commercial team.
The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line 
tool.	Old habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing 
data, rather than using the on-line functionality.
Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be 
classified as ""on account"", with issues tracked in a case management system.	Case 
management system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account 
coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.
The counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the 
counterparty/legal entity combination on the excelr invoice.	Given the number of legal 
entities excelr has, along with the number of entities our counterparties 
have, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash 
seems easier.
Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be ""settled"" with cash 
movement.	Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be ""settled"" with cash 
movement.

Converting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:
Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify
Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP
Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP
Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify

Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face 
two problems in Unify.  
Controls built into Unify are already obsolete.
Unify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net 
across products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) 
impossible.

Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no 
controls (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the 
automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable 
within SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at 
the time of finaling a payment in Unify.

To repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to 
SAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  
Please call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this 
decision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any 
additional time for consideration.

with Dave N. and Inja. They did discover some system board that is going to 
be replaced tonight. Hopefully replacing the board will do it but history 
makes me skeptical that this is the sole cause for the slow performance.

Needless to say we had to get Settlements and Volume Management to stop their 
work and we still didn't see any improvement. I know everyone is just as 
frustrated as Logistics. At our last several meetings to discuss this problem 
I was insistent that unless they have an answer it seems to me, and the rest

first of month noms and the monthly close require. 

I've included an email I received from Kathy Kelly if you want some gory

Subject: Unify

Bob,

You have probably already caught wind of this since it seems to be the only 
thing anyone is talking about today, but I wanted to bring it to your 
attention that unify is at an all time pathetic slowness today.  Basically, 
this is all I've heard about today from the schedulers.  Clarissa has just 
handed me a screen print that shows that it took 33.23 minutes to create a 
nom on Tennessee.  Robert has informed me that it has taken him 55 minutes to 
create a nom on Columbia Gas.  It took me over 30 minutes to log on today and 
as soon as I ran a report, it kicked me out saying that I didn't have enough 
memory.  

This has always been a problem at the end of the month, but this month has 
reached in all time low.  I've talked to Dave about three or four times today 
and so has Ed.  Ed has been monitoring the system and he seems to think that 
client services has been taking a large part of the CPU time.  We have both 
questioned Dave on this, but he doesn't seem to see anything unusual with the 
amount of users from accounting, although he does agree that a huge amount of 
CPU time is being used.  

I hate to end this on a  negative note, but at this rate, no one will be 
clean by 1:45 tomorrow.  I don't know what the status is as far as people 
looking into ways to make unify faster, but maybe it is time to draw some 
attention to this again.  

By the way, the bridge from sitara to unify has also been crawling today.  
I've already informed Dave of this, but the bridge was totally out of 
commission this past weekend as well.   This effected those people who tried 
to get a jump start on cleaning for the month and working on the first of the 
month noms.  I hate to say it, but once again, how can we expect people to 
get their work done, if we don't give them systems that work.  On a good 
note, I did get feedback from Clarissa that terminal server was working well 
over the weekend.  Unfortunately, she said that unify was terribly slow, but 
no slower than it is when she's here in the office.

aside due to some other pressing issues.  However, each of you agreed that a 
standard cutoff time was acceptable for US gas, power and liquids products.  

The best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4pm each day (just to get an 
idea of the numbers we were talking about, I looked at yesterday to determine 
how many deals were traded after 4pm Houston time.  We had three US Gas 
deals, and two Canadian Gas deals).  After 4pm, the bridges would 
automatically roll new EOL deals to the next day.  However, for those deals 
that do not bridge after 4pm, the various risk groups would need to remember 
that these deals are the following day's business.  I am not sure how the 
procedures in Risk would need to be modified for the trader's position 
reports, as the official books would not include these late deals.  Can Risk 
run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions 
each morning?   

I would appreciate any comments that you may have, and regardless, please 
re-confirm that a cutoff of 4pm works for each of your respective groups.

Japan.

When I went to the Exotic Energy Derivatives conference in December, I met 
Masayuki Fujita, who studies the Japanese power market for the Mitsubishi 
Research Institute.  We chatted about deregulation of the industry and about 
the entry of foreign companies into the market.

The Japanese understand the need to deregulate the industry, but want to 
avoid the pain that may be associated with it.  This process is very 
unfamiliar and uncomfortable for the Japanese.  They see power as a matter of 
national security (like agriculture), so foreign entrants into the market 
will have to tread with care, understanding, and sophistication.

Fujita is working on a report for the institute.  He has agreed to let me 
have copies of the non-confidential portions when it is finished.  In the 
interim, he sent me a copy of a presentation that I thought you might find 
interesting.

of things I want to talk to you about next week

REPORTING:
It has been a continual challenge as you well know.  The good news is the 
individual from EES (Chris Luttrell) accepted Jay's offer today and he is 
going to start on March 3.  
That said, I talked to Chris today and filled him in on where we are and what 
we want to accomplish.  He feels our best option will be Oracle.  
To ensure we are prepared for his arrival next Monday, we are preparing the 
detail of what we are doing today, both our assumptions and all of the 
various data sources for our current management reporting
Also, Dave and I met with Wanda and Georgeanne on Tuesday regarding revenue.  
I believe Dave sent you an update of this meeting.  We are meeting with 
Georgeanne today to go over our assumptions, conversions, etc. to ensure that 
we are consistent with those conversations in the annual report, and to 
ensure that we are capturing all of the excelr data
Customer database - we have been fine tuning this all week, and I think we 
are about there.  There are still some minor differences, but we are working 
to sort through these today (everyone is involved in the tie out).  I will 
review the new report format with you on Monday and we will start sending 
this out then.
We also have an Access person that is working on improving our current 
database since we will have to live with this in the short term.

TRADING ACTIVITY:
It seems that we are seeing an increase in customers wanting to modify EOL 
deals for various reasons (one being Web latency...they are claiming that the 
deal did not show up on their transaction summary, so they thought it did not 
go through, and they did another deal...and this first deal appeared sometime 
later).  We have continued to emphasize the importance of not changing these 
deals after they are completed, but despite this, it is still happening.  I 
am going to try and track down Jeff Shankman this afternoon to discuss.
We are also seeing more and more customers trading under the wrong 
entities...for example, Aquila Risk Mgmt is executing physical deals, when 
they should be only executing financial deals.  From my understanding, we 
have ""left the door open"" for them to trade either way and are relying on 
them to trade under the correct counterparty.  This is causing several 
problems downstream..for instance, customers are wanting ENA to send modified 
invoices with the name of the correct counterparty (despite the fact that 
they were the ones transacting under the wrong entity).   We need to discuss 
how leaving this door open affects our downstream processes.

OTHER:
I talked to both Dave and Bob yesterday to ensure that we were in the loop on 
new products, etc. to ensure that we are better prepared for the launch of 
new products (e.g. Credit Derivatives).  
Help desk news...Matt M. accepted a position with the Remedy development 
team.  We are going to move Noel (he works nights) to the day shift to take 
over Matt's role.  Donna assures me that he is very good.  Sandy Rivas also 
wants to leave the group.  We should be able to handle the volume of calls 
without replacing them.  I need to go over some call statistics with you next 
week.  We have not received one phone call from a customer on the weekends, 
and we receive less than .1 calls per hour between the hours of  7pm to 
midnight.  I think we can get away with eliminating weekends, and using on 
call pagers from 7 to midnight.
One question - we currently are considering EES an external counterparty and 
excelr Canada an internal counterparty.  We are now trading with Bridgeline 
Gas Marketing (joint venture with Texaco - 40% ownership).  We need to 
determine what we are considering internal vs external.   I would think these 
would be external due to the fact that these are settled transactions...  any 
thoughts?

I know this is a lot of info, but I also know you are going to be in high 
demand on Monday!

I hope you are enjoying your ski trip!!!

If they are still employed (presuming all but Ilkka are still on the payroll) 
then I believe this should be requested.  As a matter of principal it should 
have been done for all in the first place and there should be no reason why 
it could not be done now.  Admittedly the reasons will now be obvious for the 
request, we can simply tell those checked that it was overlooked originally.  
Relative to Ilkka, there is no harm in requesting it as well.  Presuming he 
won't consent then we can discuss further.

Subject: Background Checks

I have made contact with the security folks in Houston and been advised of 
what we need to do.  One obvious point is to understand the legal aspects of 
such a check.  I have now spoken to a Finnish lawyer who has advised that any 
employee background check (to include credit checks and bank checks) must 
have the prior written approval of the employee concerned and this would need 
to be provided to the source of the information before it is handed over.

I assume we need to re-think whether we want to go down this route given that 
this check process will now have a very visible profile in the Helsinki 
office.

What are your views?

Attached is an outline of the involvement we've engaged AA to perform for 
each business unit as they go-live onto SAP.  Please remember that ENA is 
going live onto SAP's ""common design"" that has already been reviewed by AA 
from a internal controls perspective.  So this attachment outlines those 
items outside of ""common design"" that Wanda and Sally  probably want covered 
from an ENA perspective.  As a rule of thumb, this proposed scope equates to 
$100k - $150k in fees to AA that is over & above the audit budget.

One word of advice:  Designate a lead within ENA that has the time to stay on 
top of the project, schedule meetings with AA, and coordinate their 
involvement with the SAP team members, e.g. not Wanda or Sally, but at a 
director/manager level at least.  I was the designee for Corp and ensured 
that AA kept the project going.  Also, I worked extensively with the Janet 
Tran, SAP lead director responsible for bringing Corp up.  Some big benefits:
Kept AA out of SAP's hair when things got rough.
Made sure that the SAP team knew what our goals & objectives were, especially 
when we found something that needed fixed before go-live.
Managed that in fact AA provided us a deliverable at the end of the project.

Please review and call if you need other info.  I'd be glad to assist ENA 
too.  I assisted Europe (Naomi Connell) and Int'l cos (John Berggren).  They 
appreciated having a ""co-pilot"" and we avoided duplication of effort with 
what had already been done for the prior go-lives.  Also, they felt that 
value was rec'd for dollars paid to AA for this work.

Subject: Unify AR -- SAP Plans


	

Two years ago excelr North America made a decision to use Unify AR for cash 
application rather than SAP AR.  We decided at the time that SAP AR would be 
kept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the 
business logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that 
Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  
I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.

Two Years Ago	Today
Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in 
place.	Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of 
existence of signed agreement.
Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.	Canada nets across 
counterparties.
Netting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain 
separate net statement process.	ENA considering netting physical and financial 
together.
All account coordinators were to apply their own cash.	Cash applied centrally in 
Power, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in 
physical Gas.
Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to 
facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.	Cash is not being 
applied meaningfully at the line item level.  The company has not made any 
move towards calculating cost of funds by commercial team.
The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line 
tool.	Old habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing 
data, rather than using the on-line functionality.
Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be 
classified as ""on account"", with issues tracked in a case management system.	Case 
management system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account 
coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.
The counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the 
counterparty/legal entity combination on the excelr invoice.	Given the number of legal 
entities excelr has, along with the number of entities our counterparties 
have, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash 
seems easier.
Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be ""settled"" with cash 
movement.	Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be ""settled"" with cash 
movement.

Converting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:
Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify
Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP
Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP
Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify

Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face 
two problems in Unify.  
Controls built into Unify are already obsolete.
Unify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net 
across products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) 
impossible.

Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no 
controls (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the 
automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable 
within SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at 
the time of finaling a payment in Unify.

To repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to 
SAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  
Please call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this 
decision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any 
additional time for consideration.

Subject: Re: Barcelona  

D Weekes is working with Tim P-P to address the resulting questions and 
should have a briefing memo together for distribution tomorrow.  We will 
follow up to answer Rick's questions at that time.  The major 
issues/questions are still a bit fluid since this just surfaced but  
presently include the following:

Issues/Questions
Exposure - Spread sheets in Liquids and CAS show dramatically different 
exposures of roughly US$ 68 MM (peak, now closer to $ 47 MM) for spreadsheets 
and US$ 13 MM for CAS.  I asked Tim to detail the anticipated exposure in 
coming weeks (ie. timing of cargoes in transit net of anticipated payments to 
be received).
Controls - Delayed mailing of Invoices by up to 30 days in some cases.  
Various other controls issues need to be addressed including where were the 
triggers in the system that should have flagged the issues earlier.
Legal Documentation - Why contract volumes were significantly exceeded and no 
documentation prepared to support trades once the 330k mtpy annual limit was 
breached?  The effect apparently was trades being done without contractual 
support.

Deliverables
Accelerate Feb month end payments (approx. 30 MM).
Disallow deferred payments from Muentes (up to 75 days in some instances) if 
customers are paying more quickly.  Current contract, now effectively 
expired, allows deferral of payments (1/3 each month starting with end of 
month of discharge).
Assign future A/R's directly from third parties on the other side of Muentes.
Create a lock box for future payments to avoid receiving $'s via Muentes.
Execute JV documentation that has now been outstanding for some time.

Goals - in sequential order:  reduce exposure to Muentes, paper 
non-documented transactions already done (ie. beyond volume limits of current 
contract, review mid/back office systems to avoid future problems, improve 
structure via JV or other interim steps if JV execution is still some time 
off.

D Weekes - Get with Ross Koller to make sure no new business is done with 
Muentes (beyond fulfilling new commitments).  Likewise, you or Hardy need to 
get with Tim P-P and R Quick in order to assure all are on the same page and 
agree the best way forward for this relationship.  Based on info. in hand, 
there does not appear to be an issue with Muentes' ability to perform (please 
confirm).  Therefore, care should be taken to maintain the relationship; 
however, I don't see the benefit in doing new deals with Muentes (beyond 
fulfilling current commitments) until the exposure is brought down.  Muentes 
does not appear to justify additional exposure based on my conversation with 
Hardy last week.  So, before the credit limit is reconsidered, the structure 
needs to be improved where payments bypass Muentes (via lockbox or another 
alternative) and A/R's assigned directly to ENE.  The new JV documents may 
take steps to improve the structure; however, this needs to be confirmed as 
it has been some time since the JV docs. have been circulated.

Steve I had a brief conversation with Rick today and Barcelona came up.

I am still a little out of it from my travels, but let me take a first shot 
at my reaction to this:
 I think we ought to at least challenge the notion that the mark-to-market 
exposure is so arcane as to be dismissed.  Generally, time is of the essence 
in most contractual relationships and the value of that time should take into 
account both time value of money and the value of the underlying at critical 
times.  
 I think that RAC should be deeply involved in setting negotiating strategy 
and be part of any decisions made.
I will add to this if and when the haze clears up.

Subject: 2001 Anticipated Budget Adjustments for HPL Sale

During the budgeting process for 2001 I gave Dave Delainey an estimated cost 
savings for Energy Operations assuming the sale of HPL. Since this is clearly 
on the horizon, we need to take a close look at opportunities for cost 
savings and our estimated timing on those savings.  I will ask James by copy 
of this memo to set up a meeting late this week to cover this.  I want to be 
able to get back with Dave with more detailed estimates of cost savings.

second most critical Year 2000 rollover date, second only to the millennium 
rollover.  A year divisible by 100 is not a leap year, unless it is divisible 
by 400.  As a consequence, some applications that were programmed incorrectly 
will believe the date is March 1, which may cause system errors.

During the millennium rollover excelr encountered Y2K related issues only with 
the bottom tier of applications and embedded systems that were ranked as 
""ordinary"" or ""low"" in our triage processes.  The problems that did arise 
were few and were quickly fixed.  This is exactly what we were planning for 
and is a testament to a job done exceptionally well by all.  

In consideration of the few and minor problems excelr encountered on January 
1, 2000, our procedures for the 29th will be curtailed.  The goals for this 
period are to validate that all mission critical applications and embedded 
systems are functioning normally and to ensure that all problems are reported 
through the project office.  We are not planning to reopen the Millennium 
Management Center nor do we plan to operate outside of normal business hours.

Please ensure that each group that reported to you for the millennium 
rollover run through the same Y2K checklists for critical systems.  For this 
exercise, however, we anticipate them reporting back to you on an exception 
basis only.

If problems do occur, the nature, details and planned ready dates should be 
forwarded to Andrew Parsons (713 853-6665) or Bob Johansen (713 853-6842), 
who will report to management and monitor events.  Also, be sure to route any 
inquiries from the press through the same public relations contacts that were 
used on January 1st.  The key contact at Corp Public Relations is Karen Denne 
(713 853-9757).

Subject: Argentine Gas Process Flow

Greetings.

Attached is the Argentine gas process flow, which has been under review for 
the past month or so by Mike Guerriero, his staff in BA and my group in 
Houston.   The Southern Cone trading support is based off of this model, so 
it also applies to power in BA and SP.   I do have process flows for power in 
both places, but I would like to revisit them prior to distribution.   If you 
would like them regardless, just let me know and I will pass them along asap.

I hope you have a successful trip.   Please let me know how I can be of 
help.   I am curious to hear your findings.

Ms. Gorsuch,

Darryl Matthews, NABA's executive director, asked that I forward you
information on our 2001 Technical Session Program as a follow-up to your
recent meeting with him.  This year's convention will be held in Dallas,
Texas, July 10-14, 2001.  A dynamic technical session program has been
developed which promises to be outstanding--up to 24 hours of continuing
professional education (CPE) credits will be available to the more than
2,000 expected conventioneers.  We are also pleased to offer the 4th Annual
Executive Leadership Development Institute, which is designed specifically
for the senior-level accounting/finance professional.

Attached you will find our national convention's Technical Session Agenda.
As a corporate sponsor of our convention, we invite you to identify company
representatives who are interested in serving as technical session speakers.
Please complete the Speaker Recommendation Form and return it with
supporting documents by Friday, March 2nd.  Candidates will be selected
based on the following criteria: credentials--evidenced by technical
expertise and experience--which support knowledge of the topic(s) of
interest; demonstrated presentation skills and experience speaking to large,
diverse groups; and a willingness to speak pro-bono.  You will be notified
in writing by the second week of April if the representative has been
selected as the speaker.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!

exporting time to ETA (the Corporate payroll system), which is NOON on 
Wednesday, February 16.  Any timesheets that are not approved by the 10:00 
Tuesday deadline will automatically be approved by the Energy Operations

FYI - For the payroll period ending 1/31, there was only 1 timesheet 
outstanding at the established deadline.  In the past, there have been as 
many as 100 (which represents a little more than 25% of the Energy Operations 
headcount).  Thanks for your help and support.  I know that the Assistants 
all appreciate your help in meeting this deadline.

A lot of you may not be affected by Project Hurricane.  If you don't know 
anything about it, then you probably aren't affected by it!  In any event, we 
have set up 2 new E-work orders in the Org Database for Project Hurricane.  
They are as follows:

E-HURR (should be used to capture all time spent on the ongoing support for 
Project Hurricane)
E-HSET (should be used to capture all set-up costs)

Both of these work orders are set up and can be used for the 2/15 pay 
period.  However, the following steps must be taken for your employees to use 
the ATES system and code their time to these work orders:

MANAGERS - Identify employees within your RC that will need to charge time to 
either or both of these work orders.  Please let your Assistants know who 
these employees are.
ASSISTANTS - Based on the information you receive from your managers, you 
must add 1 or both of the work orders to each employee's profile in the Org 
Database so that they are able to charge time to the work order in ATES.
ASSISTANTS - For each Time Site you are responsible for, you must be sure to 
add this information to ETA.  If you aren't sure how to handle this, please 
contact Kim Perkins ASAP at x3-5304.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation in getting timesheets processed in 
a timely manner.  Please be sure to share this information with your staff if 
you haven't already done so.  If you have any questions on the timesheets or 
the work orders, please contact me at x3-6343.

Fernley,
On January 25, 1999, I had breakfast in London with a shaking Richard Sage 
who recounted the tail of Barry threatening his bonus and employment for 
doing exactly what Jeff Skilling told him to do in the previous November.  
Subsequently, Richard was ""moved"" from his position and Barry promoted.   If 
that is dealing with the situation, this actually reflects on your 
credibility.  If you think that an open communication, independent back 
office message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London 
by virtue of your promotion of Barry twice in 12 months, then you are sorely 
mistaken. 
On February 2, 2000 the Arthur Andersen team, including Tom Bauer, John 
Sorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily 
completing the Audit tasks from London.
I am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here.  You have dismissed 
my ""advice"" and you need to do what you need to do.
If the goal is to get me to change my view, you have a big hole to dig out 
of.  I obviously can't change your point of view.  I still feel a 
responsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to 
surface. It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will 
be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money 
trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere.
Need I go on.

Ted,

We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on 
specific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and 
prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and 
the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has 
changed since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality 
risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary 
recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard). 

Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the 
Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I 
suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team - 
his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his 
considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult 
to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to 
address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this 
issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any ""prosecutable"" 
offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management 
style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and 
objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank) 
with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a 
different story to tell on Helsinki.

As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour', 
although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks 
back. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy 
to contribute staff to this too.

Fernley,
As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I 
think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I 
will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER 
""prosecutable"" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more 
communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his 
transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in 
charge of the office.  Probably more to the point,
it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team 
that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that 
he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from 
Houston has to be part of the ""World Tour""  in Europe (Brent Price), that 
your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David 
Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve 
Young.

Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry 
has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell, 
and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I 
just happen to be the most vocal.

Subject: Trading Support Operations - London

Rick,

Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support 
function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we 
already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more 
permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in excelr and I think Barry 
understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we 
would give him/her the job. 

I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the 
team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant 
value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'. 
However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and, 
whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I 
can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.

I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted 
within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in 
London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy 
to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will 
be monitoring the situation very closely.

Regards

Fernley.

Subject: Re: Metals  

Andy,

Thanks so much for your message.  I had you on my ""To Do"" list today to 
follow-up from our conversation last week.  I appreciate your responses, and 
will follow-up as needed.

Just to recap EIM's current inititives.

PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was engaged in 10/00 to develop a business plan 
for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical 
business.  In 11/00, AA was engaged to develop a ""Blueprint"" of EIM major 
processes (Deal Execution, Deal Capture, Risk Management, Logistics, 
Settlements and Financial Reporting), down to level 2 processes.  The 
initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the 
""Blueprint"", a gap analysis of excelr systems to business needs and 
recommended systems.  A complete ""roadmap"" should be laid out with a 
0-3months, 4-6months, 7-9 months and 10-12months timeline.  The plan 
addresses tactical also.  

Our overall objective:  Build an infrastructure (people, processes and 
systems) that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM.  The 
current industries are Forest Products and Steel.  However, additional 
industries may be added.  The targeted infrastructure would require little 
change to support new industries.  

The delieverable is expected by the end of 2/01.  We'd be happy to visit with 
you all (video conference or Houston,....) to give you more information.  Let 
me know how to proceed.  

Thanks again for your time.  Since I wasn't able to attend the Controllers' 
Conference last 10/00, I'm glad I got to meet you last week.  Stay in touch.

Subject: Metals

Brenda

As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality 
between excelr Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals.

In particular I promised info on a few areas:

Project Q assessment

A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to excelr Metals 
(being to do with interfaces with our AS400 ysstem) however high level issues 
which formed part of the decision to not develop this for excelr metals were:
Q is over specified for metals. Traffic / logistics for metals is less 
complex than oil & coal.
Metals process tends towards Buy>Store>Sell whereas for liquids the storage 
is not as prevelant
Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship/barge

2.    Inventory Controls

Again the reports produced here have been very specific to excelr Metals. Paul 
Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on 
developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul 
directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in 
general.

3.    Funding of inventory

We have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific to 
excelr Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are 
the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured 
financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either 
David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro 
to the issues faced.

4.    Curve Management Process

The markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME 
curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and 
location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by 
brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with 
5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6 
for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made 
manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port 
groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points 
i.e. price of  specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a 
market quote.

5.    Re recruitment of paper traders

I haven't been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David 
Rosenblum, one of the metals traders in Chicago, is a trader of recylced 
paper.

I'll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London. 
I'd appreciate same for EIM.

Regards
Andy

In view of the continued integration of a number of excelr global functions, I 
am pleased to announce that the European Trading Support functions will, with 
immediate effect, be consolidated into one operational unit. This unit, to be 
headed by Barry Pearce (VP of Trading Support Operations) and based in 
London, will include the European Gas, European Power and the Global Liquids 
groups.

This newly created unit will work within the remit of Global Risk Management 
Operations and will adopt the following core responsibilities in Europe.

1. Enhance communication and integration among all trading support operations 
professionals.
2. Assure the proliferation of best operational practices. 
3. Facilitate the allocation of human and systems resources.  
4. Provide key training for all trading support operations personnel.
5. Co-ordinate user requirements for shared operational systems. 
6. Work with ECT NA to oversee the creation of a global internal control 
audit plan for trading support   activities.
7. Establish procedures for opening trading support operations offices and 
create key benchmarks for   measuring on-going trading risk controls.   
   
In this role, Barry and his team will ensure that all excelr operations in 
Europe meet the extremely high standards of trading support we expect 
throughout our organisation. Barry will report directly to myself and also to 
Sally Beck in her capacity as head of Global Risk Management Operations.

Barry has been involved in the European Energy Operations function since 1993 
and manages risk management administration, risk consolidation and reporting, 
contract administration, contract settlements, cash management and trading 
accounting for ECT Europe's physical commodity trading, energy derivatives 
trading and financial products trading. He has been with excelr since 1992, 
when he joined the company from Arthur Andersen. 

Please join me in congratulating Barry in his new role and supporting him and 
his team in this exciting challenge they have ahead.

Subject: Re: Metals  

Andy,

Thanks so much for your message.  I had you on my ""To Do"" list today to 
follow-up from our conversation last week.  I appreciate your responses, and 
will follow-up as needed.

Just to recap EIM's current inititives.

PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was engaged in 10/00 to develop a business plan 
for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical 
business.  In 11/00, AA was engaged to develop a ""Blueprint"" of EIM major 
processes (Deal Execution, Deal Capture, Risk Management, Logistics, 
Settlements and Financial Reporting), down to level 2 processes.  The 
initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the 
""Blueprint"", a gap analysis of excelr systems to business needs and 
recommended systems.  A complete ""roadmap"" should be laid out with a 
0-3months, 4-6months, 7-9 months and 10-12months timeline.  The plan 
addresses tactical also.  

Our overall objective:  Build an infrastructure (people, processes and 
systems) that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM.  The 
current industries are Forest Products and Steel.  However, additional 
industries may be added.  The targeted infrastructure would require little 
change to support new industries.  

The delieverable is expected by the end of 2/01.  We'd be happy to visit with 
you all (video conference or Houston,....) to give you more information.  Let 
me know how to proceed.  

Thanks again for your time.  Since I wasn't able to attend the Controllers' 
Conference last 10/00, I'm glad I got to meet you last week.  Stay in touch.

Brenda

As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality 
between excelr Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals.

In particular I promised info on a few areas:

Project Q assessment

A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to excelr Metals 
(being to do with interfaces with our AS400 ysstem) however high level issues 
which formed part of the decision to not develop this for excelr metals were:
Q is over specified for metals. Traffic / logistics for metals is less 
complex than oil & coal.
Metals process tends towards Buy>Store>Sell whereas for liquids the storage 
is not as prevelant
Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship/barge

2.    Inventory Controls

Again the reports produced here have been very specific to excelr Metals. Paul 
Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on 
developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul 
directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in 
general.

3.    Funding of inventory

We have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific to 
excelr Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are 
the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured 
financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either 
David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro 
to the issues faced.

4.    Curve Management Process

The markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME 
curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and 
location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by 
brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with 
5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6 
for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made 
manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port 
groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points 
i.e. price of  specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a 
market quote.

5.    Re recruitment of paper traders

I haven't been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David 
Rosenblum, one of the metals traders in Chicago, is a trader of recylced 
paper.

I'll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London. 
I'd appreciate same for EIM.

Andy

We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on 
specific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and 
prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and 
the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has 
changed since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality 
risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary 
recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard). 

Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the 
Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I 
suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team - 
his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his 
considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult 
to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to 
address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this 
issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any ""prosecutable"" 
offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management 
style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and 
objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank) 
with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a 
different story to tell on Helsinki.

As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour', 
although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks 
back. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy 
to contribute staff to this too.

Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London  

Fernley,
As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I 
think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I 
will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER 
""prosecutable"" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more 
communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his 
transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in 
charge of the office.  Probably more to the point,
it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team 
that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that 
he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from 
Houston has to be part of the ""World Tour""  in Europe (Brent Price), that 
your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David 
Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve 
Young.

Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry 
has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell, 
and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I 
just happen to be the most vocal.

Subject: Trading Support Operations - London

Rick,

Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support 
function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we 
already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more 
permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in excelr and I think Barry 
understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we 
would give him/her the job. 

I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the 
team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant 
value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'. 
However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and, 
whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I 
can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.

I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted 
within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in 
London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy 
to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will 
be monitoring the situation very closely.

I am writing to you to express my interest in working for excelr.  I have
long been interested in a career in business, and I would love the
opportunity to explore business in excelr this summer.

As I have worked with the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club (HEC) and various
entrepreneurs association around the country to spearhead the effort to
form a national collegiate entrepreneurs organization, I have learned a
great deal about how organizations work and how to make them effective.
This theme of entrepreneurship has spilled over into my other activities as
well.  I am coordinating the first annual fundraising banquet for Christian
Impact to help us raise money for outreach events.  I am also co-leading
the first mission trip comprised of Harvard students this summer.  Because
this effort is taking me to Latin America for the first half of the summer,
I will be in Houston from mid-July to mid-September.  If there is a
position available at excelr, I would enjoy working for it while I am here.

I am excited about the opportunity to learn more about the business world.
The combination of resourcefulness, rigorous logic, and creativity called
for in the business sphere intrigues me.  The integration of global and
analytical thinking also piques my interest. I have attached my resume for
you to review, I will be in Houston from March 27-31 if you would like to
interview me. Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing
from you!

December Brent Crude Commodity Positions.  When we get these numbers we will 
reissue this report, but they are not likely to be different enough from the 
guesses we inserted to make a difference. 

Total VaR is the highest I have seen at $92 million.  

One reason is that trading commodities VaR remains very high at $66 million 
(though it is down from the $81 million of November).  

The other reason is that trading securities VaR is by far the highest it has 
been at $63 million.  Merchant Assets (with a VaR of $29 million) and total 
return swaps (with a VaR of $56, up from $24 in November) are at all time 
highs. 

Bacchus and Riva (both originated in December) conspired to increase total 
return swap VaR.  Nevertheless, the biggest culprit is Cerberus (a fixed for 
EOG shares swap we put on in November).  Cerberus contains ten million 
unhedged shares of EOG.  The value of the shares increased from $42 in 
November to $55 in December, raising VaR substantially.

Subject: Re: Metals  

Andy,

Thanks so much for your message.  I had you on my ""To Do"" list today to 
follow-up from our conversation last week.  I appreciate your responses, and 
will follow-up as needed.

Just to recap EIM's current inititives.

PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was engaged in 10/00 to develop a business plan 
for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical 
business.  In 11/00, AA was engaged to develop a ""Blueprint"" of EIM major 
processes (Deal Execution, Deal Capture, Risk Management, Logistics, 
Settlements and Financial Reporting), down to level 2 processes.  The 
initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the 
""Blueprint"", a gap analysis of excelr systems to business needs and 
recommended systems.  A complete ""roadmap"" should be laid out with a 
0-3months, 4-6months, 7-9 months and 10-12months timeline.  The plan 
addresses tactical also.  

Our overall objective:  Build an infrastructure (people, processes and 
systems) that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM.  The 
current industries are Forest Products and Steel.  However, additional 
industries may be added.  The targeted infrastructure would require little 
change to support new industries.  

The delieverable is expected by the end of 2/01.  We'd be happy to visit with 
you all (video conference or Houston,....) to give you more information.  Let 
me know how to proceed.  

Thanks again for your time.  Since I wasn't able to attend the Controllers' 
Conference last 10/00, I'm glad I got to meet you last week.  Stay in touch.

Brenda

Brenda

As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality 
between excelr Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals.

In particular I promised info on a few areas:

Project Q assessment

A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to excelr Metals 
(being to do with interfaces with our AS400 ysstem) however high level issues 
which formed part of the decision to not develop this for excelr metals were:
Q is over specified for metals. Traffic / logistics for metals is less 
complex than oil & coal.
Metals process tends towards Buy>Store>Sell whereas for liquids the storage 
is not as prevelant
Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship/barge

2.    Inventory Controls

Again the reports produced here have been very specific to excelr Metals. Paul 
Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on 
developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul 
directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in 
general.

3.    Funding of inventory

We have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific to 
excelr Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are 
the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured 
financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either 
David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro 
to the issues faced.

4.    Curve Management Process

The markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME 
curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and 
location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by 
brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with 
5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6 
for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made 
manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port 
groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points 
i.e. price of  specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a 
market quote.

5.    Re recruitment of paper traders

I haven't been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David 
Rosenblum, one of the metals traders in Chicago, is a trader of recylced 
paper.

I'll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London. 
I'd appreciate same for EIM.

Regards
Andy

stability of one of the reload facilities we currently use in the Chicago 
area, Premier Reload Inc.  I met with Romney Ruder, Lumber trader, Roy 
Lipsett, Logistics, and Mike Moscoso, Lumber business controller, this 
morning to gather information and develop a plan.  This is summarized below.

General Information:

Premier is a facility we have been using for a few months, located in 
Franklin Park within Chicago.  We deliver to the facility via railcar, and 
ship out via truck.  We currently have about 3.8 million board feet, valued 
at about $1 million, in the facility.  During the holidays, we began 
experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely.  We have 
been pressing for information, and are hearing rumors that have raised 
significant concerns.  Although excelr has not received written notification, 
we learned today that Premier notified customers that they would not be 
taking in any more products.  Additionally, we have heard that the owner, 
Jeff Leske, is closing the facility, and will be going to work for another 
reload facility in Chicago, Reserve Marine Terminal (RMT).  We have been in 
negotiations with RMT for a long term arrangement, and much of the 
information we have obtained is through our contact there.  In fact, we have 
diverted recent shipments to RMT.  There is a rumor that Premier and /or 
Leske may declare bankruptcy.  There is a rumor that Premier has been 
incurring ""switching"" fees with the railroad (IHB) and has not been paying 
them.  There is a rumor that Premier has not been paying employment taxes and 
there are problems with the IRS.  All in all, there are many rumors but very 
few known facts.

Plan:

Met with Legal today to get advice.  They recommended moving the product 
ASAP, but until moved, we needed to confirm the product was marked as ""excelr"" 
product, and that it is stored separately from other product.  They are 
drafting a contract to specify the arrangement with Premier.  It will be 
ready tomorrow.
Met with Credit.  They are not a included in the reload selection process, so 
the financial stability of the company has not been reviewed.  A D&B was 
pulled today, and it confirms a lien filed by the IRS on 6/22/00 for 
$86,128.  There is one suit pending by a trucking company in a nominal 
amount, filed 1/13/00.  The company is owned 100% by Leske, and was started 
in 1995.  Very little other information is available, and D&B did not assign 
a PAYDEX score.
Mike Moscoso and Romney Ruder are going to the premises tomorrow to:  gather 
financial information, intentions of the owner and the associated timeline, 
substantiate the inventory, and get the contract signed that Legal is 
drafting.  On Friday morning, Roy Lipsett will join them to meet with RMT, 
discuss movement of the product and complete the negotiations.
Depending on the information gathered tomorrow, we will determine next 
steps.  If we start moving the product to RMT, the estimated timeline is 
about 13 to 14 days, moving 10 trucks per day (total truckloads = 135).  
Estimated cost for the movement is about is $25,000.  Another $25,000 would 
be incurred for unload fees at RMT if we can't get them to wave them.  About 
half of the product has already been sold, and will be delivered over the 
next 5 weeks.  Romney is working with customers to determine if they can take 
the product earlier.

I will keep you informed as to the next events.  However, we need to take 
immediate steps to put a policy and process in place for warehousing 
facilities.  I have initiated weekly cross-functional staff meetings (Tax, 
Legal, Credit, IT, Logistics, Fundemental Analysis, Accounting, etc.), and 
our first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.  I will have this on the agenda, 
and will lead the effort to develop the process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Generally, this seems to be fine.  I think that Steve and I would like to 
clarify the credit limit review issue.  Please see him for some semantical 
changes to that one line.  
Regarding the expected/maximum exposure calculation,  I believe that this is 
incredibly misleading and if not changed would be inclined to forward my own 
interpretation.    WE LOST $18MM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  - NOT $5MM.  I think 
that we should make a distinction between what has already been realized as 
opposed to what writedowns need to be taken, but it all better add up to 
$18MM.  Regarding the additional exposures, my impression is that our true 
expectation for counterparty claims is close to zero while we do expect to 
terminate one or more employees which would incur severance cost.

Subject: Lumber Reload Facility - Premier


Yesterday I was informed that there was a concern about the financial
stability of one of the reload facilities we currently use in the Chicago
area, Premier Reload Inc.  I met with Romney Ruder, Lumber trader, Roy
Lipsett, Logistics, and Mike Moscoso, Lumber business controller, this
morning to gather information and develop a plan.  This is summarized
below.

General Information:

Premier is a facility we have been using for a few months, located in
Franklin Park within Chicago.  We deliver to the facility via railcar, and
ship out via truck.  We currently have about 3.8 million board feet, valued
at about $1 million, in the facility.  During the holidays, we began
experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely.  We have
been pressing for information, and are hearing rumors that have raised
significant concerns.  Although excelr has not received written
notification, we learned today that Premier notified customers that they
would not be taking in any more products.  Additionally, we have heard that
the owner, Jeff Leske, is closing the facility, and will be going to work
for another reload facility in Chicago, Reserve Marine Terminal (RMT).  We
have been in negotiations with RMT for a long term arrangement, and much of
the information we have obtained is through our contact there.  In fact, we
have diverted recent shipments to RMT.  There is a rumor that Premier and
/or Leske may declare bankruptcy.  There is a rumor that Premier has been
incurring ""switching"" fees with the railroad (IHB) and has not been paying
them.  There is a rumor that Premier has not been paying employment taxes
and there are problems with the IRS.  All in all, there are many rumors but
very few known facts.

Plan:

   Met with Legal today to get advice.  They recommended moving the product
   ASAP, but until moved, we needed to confirm the product was marked as
   ""excelr"" product, and that it is stored separately from other product.
   They are drafting a contract to specify the arrangement with Premier.
   It will be ready tomorrow.
   Met with Credit.  They are not a included in the reload selection
   process, so the financial stability of the company has not been
   reviewed.  A D&B was pulled today, and it confirms a lien filed by the
   IRS on 6/22/00 for $86,128.  There is one suit pending by a trucking
   company in a nominal amount, filed 1/13/00.  The company is owned 100%
   by Leske, and was started in 1995.  Very little other information is
   available, and D&B did not assign a PAYDEX score.
   Mike Moscoso and Romney Ruder are going to the premises tomorrow to:
   gather financial information, intentions of the owner and the associated
   timeline, substantiate the inventory, and get the contract signed that
   Legal is drafting.  On Friday morning, Roy Lipsett will join them to
   meet with RMT, discuss movement of the product and complete the
   negotiations.
   Depending on the information gathered tomorrow, we will determine next
   steps.  If we start moving the product to RMT, the estimated timeline is
   about 13 to 14 days, moving 10 trucks per day (total truckloads = 135).
   Estimated cost for the movement is about is $25,000.  Another $25,000
   would be incurred for unload fees at RMT if we can't get them to wave
   them.  About half of the product has already been sold, and will be
   delivered over the next 5 weeks.  Romney is working with customers to
   determine if they can take the product earlier.

I will keep you informed as to the next events.  However, we need to take
immediate steps to put a policy and process in place for warehousing
facilities.  I have initiated weekly cross-functional staff meetings (Tax,
Legal, Credit, IT, Logistics, Fundemental Analysis, Accounting, etc.), and
our first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.  I will have this on the
agenda, and will lead the effort to develop the process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Several  observations:
most people were signing up for 1-2 classes, so the decision to run these in 
half-day increments was a good choice on your part
the fact that there is already a waiting list after two hours shows the 
pent-up demand for this type of skill building program
the skills you have targeted were right on.  That is not to say there are not 
other ones that are needed, but clearly these first ones are needed

Subject: Leadership Development Progress


Thank you again for participating in the Leadership Development vendor
selection process in December.

Based on the decisions we made at the meeting, we are ready to conduct a
pilot February 8-10 of six modules from Wilson Learning Corporation.
The purpose of the pilot is to evaluate Wilson Learning materials and
facilitators and present a portion of the Leadership curriculum.  We will
also pilot the communications module for non-supervisory employees.

We ask that you invite 1-2 managers from your group to participate and
evaluate the modules.  Participants should plan to complete a minimum of two
modules.  In addition, you are invited to participate in as many as you
would like.  We are also opening this pilot to managers throughout ENA to 
ensure 
that the material adapts well  We are currently completing the curriculum 
design 
and plan to have information available in February.

As you may remember these are the decisions we reached at the meeting in
December:

* Use Southwest Performance Group (SWP)and Wilson Learning products as our
primary vendor and Achieve Global as a secondary.
* Create an excelr faculty of outside facilitators that meet our specified
requirements.
* Ensure that the skills in our curriculum are matched to different levels
of manager.
* Ensure that we incorporate data available from consultants currently
working with Energy
Operations
* Incorporate current excelr course offerings into ENA curriculum

Attached for your review are:

* Facilitator Profile
* Curriculum Table - mapping skills to courses

Descriptions of each module are also attached for your review



The following are half-day sessions.  Supervisors may sign up for any or all 
depending on their need.  It would be helpful if supervisors attend a minimum 
of two modules.  We need to have a minimum of 9 participants for the course 
to be effective.  As an added bonus, I will cover the cost of attending the 
pilot.  (As you may remember, cost for attending programs in 2000 will be 
charged back to the business unit)

Date   Module     Time    Target Audience

Feb. 8   Meeting Leadership Challenges   8-12 am    Supervisors with less 
than 6 months experience

   Working Styles     1-5 pm    Any supervisor 

Feb. 9   Coaching To Performance   8-12 am    Any supervisor

   Motivating For Results    1-5 pm    Any supervisor

Feb. 10   Communicating Effectively   8-12 am    Any employee

Other details:

* Sessions will be held in Room 560.
* Participants should plan to attend a minimum of two sessions.
* Please call Gracie Presas to register by February 1.  
* Descriptions of each module are provided in the attachment.


If you have further questions concerning this pilot, please contact me at

Subject: Annual Report VAR Disclosures - open items

This is Part II of the open items on VAR, addressing ECM, PGE & affiliate 
books

From my review of Eugenio's consolidated VAR spreadsheet, the following 
listed items are those that are open that we           need information from 
you on.   Corp. is looking to type the first draft of the Annual Report (to 
be discussed with the Audit Committee) THIS FRIDAY, so we need your help with 
this information as soon as possible.  If you will not be able to have all of 
the information to Eugenio by Thursday night, please let me know.  We may be 
able to give you some additional time to gather some of the smaller pieces.   
If you need to forward this on to others, please do so.

AA if you know of any other issues of completeness that I have not addressed, 
please let Eugenio and I know! 


*Have AA and Jan Johnson concluded that we only need to include the puts on 
the excelr stock?  If so we need all twelve months of comparable data as 
applicable.    Steve Ross sent to Eugenio on Monday (yesterday).  Let him 
know if he needs to re-send it.

*Are the swaps shown on the ECM FN3 schedule for the phantom stock plan the 
puts that we have been talking about?  If not do these swaps need to be 
included in VAR and the non-trading portion of FN3?  I haven't seen them 
before.   These are new puts.  I checked with Jan.  She said to include the 
positions as non-trading equity.  The trades were both done in November by 
Gary Hickerson's group.  Be sure he hasn't included them in his numbers.  
We'll get the VaR for November and December to you on Wednesday.  (Steve, 
this is yours).  

*What is Yosemite?  Is it a TRS that I need to include in VAR and FN3?  
Internally we call it a swap but in the legal document it is called an 
Agreement.  It's actually more of a guarantee.  I talked to Jan about it and 
we don't think it goes in FN3. 

*For non-trading I\R and F\X, we are still missing all non-quarter end 
months.    Jeff, this ones yours.  We need to send the information to 
Research and have them run the VaR monthly in 2000 also.

*PGE - January,February and March VAR is missing on Eugenio's schedule.  I 
don't have a clue what PGE's information is.  I only know about Rhythms which 
is in a separate section.  You'll have to ask PGE.

*What month was the EOG sale effective?  We need commodity affiliate for all 
of the non-quarter end months prior to the sale.  The sale took place August 
16.  I have never even heard of any EOG commodity affiliate position.  I was 
told Greg Adams handled these at one point.  I'll ask him tomorrow.

before.   These are new puts.  I checked with Jan.  She said to include the 
positions as non-trading equity.  The trades were both done in November by 
Gary Hickerson's group.  Be sure he hasn't included them in his numbers.  
We'll get the VaR for November and December to you on Wednesday.  (Steve, 
this is yours).  

*What is Yosemite?  Is it a TRS that I need to include in VAR and FN3?  
Internally we call it a swap but in the legal document it is called an 
Agreement.  It's actually more of a guarantee.  I talked to Jan about it and 
we don't think it goes in FN3. 

*For non-trading I\R and F\X, we are still missing all non-quarter end 
months.    Jeff, this ones yours.  We need to send the information to 
Research and have them run the VaR monthly in 2000 also.

*PGE - January,February and March VAR is missing on Eugenio's schedule.  I 
don't have a clue what PGE's information is.  I only know about Rhythms which 
is in a separate section.  You'll have to ask PGE.

*What month was the EOG sale effective?  We need commodity affiliate for all 
of the non-quarter end months prior to the sale.  The sale took place August 
16.  I have never even heard of any EOG commodity affiliate position.  I was 
told Greg Adams handled these at one point.  I'll ask him tomorrow.

Subject: Re: EOL Revenues  

Jason,

We are looking for a way to extract excelr On-line revenues and sales volumes 
out of your regular upstream invoicing system that presumably feeds SAP.   
For the first quarter of 2000 (and thereafter) excelr Corp. in  seriously 
contemplating disclosing in press releases, EOL volumes and revenues separate 
from traditional volumes and revenues.  They need to be able to get these 
numbers out of our regular accounting records.  The numbers that the EOL team 
calculates out of their systems (which is not a financial system) can be used 
to verify that the accounting numbers are being extracted correctly.

Currently for ENA,  the EOL trade system feeds Sitara (deal capture) and 
passes over an EOL deal number.  Sitara assigns it's own deal number but 
passes both numbers when it feeds our settlement & logistics system (Unify).  
Unify currently feeds our general ledger but it is not set up to book based 
upon the EOL  tag, we are designing that into our SAP design.  In the 
meantime, we will query Unify and extract the portion of Unify revenues and 
volumes that are EOL.  We will then book  a reclass into Hyperion to separate 
EOL revenues from traditional revenues.    We are currently using numbers 
provided by Bob Shults for 1999 to verify that everything is working 
correctly.  We are finding valid timing differences due to assumptions that 
Bob is making.

Unfortunately, a few of the products that are being traded or will be traded 
on EOL do not feed into settlement systems like Unify but rather are invoiced 
manually.  We are having to identify a way to accurately capture those 
numbers as well, so that they can also be reclassified in Hyperion. 

This project has a pretty short fuse as there is much outside interest in EOL 
and thus a  great need to be able to accurately calculate sales revenues and 
sales volumes.

Please call me with any questions that you have and keep me updated  on your 
progress.

Hi Georgeanne,

Donnah mentioned that Bob Shults has the statistical information you required 
for London EOL transactions but you require more supporting documentation to 
back them up.

Would you be able to send me the reports and let me know the information you 
are looking for.  I will then be able to ask around the relevant people and 
see what we can dig out for you.

We would like to push up the consolidated DPR delivery time to approximately

As you know, we have been working to find new ways to improve Unify Logistics 
functions.  A major step has now been achieved by installing TIBCO and moving 
it into production today.  

 Utilizing TIBCO in conjunction with our other enhancements will enable 
Logistics to obtain real time updates from both EOL and Sitara without having 
to re-retrieve them from the database.  This will automatically update 
Scheduler screens with new deals as it comes without action on their part and 
also reduce required database access.  This has been achieved through great 
team work between many groups including Logistics Schedulers, Unify IT 
Logistics & ADE, UNIX and Network people.    Please let me know if you want 
to know more details.   Thank you.",Non Abusive
26661,beck-s/all_documents/2697.,<12858517.1075855811015.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"We have pursued implementing Unify in London, however there are a number of 
issues preventing that from happening in the near future:

The Unify IT team has a lot of competing priorities (including the Houston 
SAP implementation, as well as Houston and Calgary changes and enahncements), 
and are unable to commit to a firm implementation date at this time.
New commitments by ENA (see mail at bottom) have further complicated the 
priorities, so even the tentative plans for implementing Unify in London this 
year are in doubt.
On the IT side, there are a number of issues with support and scalability of 
the current architecture of the system.

As it doesn't look like Unify can be implemented in London this year, we will 
therefore change focus to streamlining the existing tactical solutions in 
London (enhancing Back Office Settlements System, integrating with Global 
CounterParties, removing London Office Manager, and using SAP where 
appropriate).

Once Unify has been integrated with SAP in Houston we will in a better 
position to consider the long-term strategic approach to Unify in London.   
If anyone believes that we should take a different response, please respond 
to this email.

Subject: Revised Unify Plan

During the last few weeks, we experienced significant increases in Unify 
transaction volumes because of Columbia Energy Services acquisition, EOL and 
Calgary implementation.   For example, recently the Logistics transactions 
increased by 91% while deal/meter count increased by 61% and total volume 
(MMBTU) by 66%.  In addition, it is very possible that volumes may increase 
by another 30% due to  new acquisitions in the near future. For these 
reasons, we  must put our efforts in overhauling Unify Settlement  now before 
working on London implementation.  Therefore, we are postponing our February 
out visit to London.,  We will let you know our revised plans and targets as 
soon as we can.  Thank you.

selection process in December.

Based on the decisions we made at the meeting, we are ready to conduct a
pilot February 8-10 of six modules from Wilson Learning Corporation.
The purpose of the pilot is to evaluate Wilson Learning materials and
facilitators and present a portion of the Leadership curriculum.  We will
also pilot the communications module for non-supervisory employees.

We ask that you invite 1-2 managers from your group to participate and
evaluate the modules.  Participants should plan to complete a minimum of two
modules.  In addition, you are invited to participate in as many as you
would like.  We are also opening this pilot to managers throughout ENA to 
ensure 
that the material adapts well  We are currently completing the curriculum 
design 
and plan to have information available in February.

As you may remember these are the decisions we reached at the meeting in
December:

* Use Southwest Performance Group (SWP)and Wilson Learning products as our
primary vendor and Achieve Global as a secondary.
* Create an excelr faculty of outside facilitators that meet our specified
requirements.
* Ensure that the skills in our curriculum are matched to different levels
of manager.
* Ensure that we incorporate data available from consultants currently
working with Energy
Operations
* Incorporate current excelr course offerings into ENA curriculum

Attached for your review are:

* Facilitator Profile
* Curriculum Table - mapping skills to courses

Descriptions of each module are also attached for your review



The following are half-day sessions.  Supervisors may sign up for any or all 
depending on their need.  It would be helpful if supervisors attend a minimum 
of two modules.  We need to have a minimum of 9 participants for the course 
to be effective.  As an added bonus, I will cover the cost of attending the 
pilot.  (As you may remember, cost for attending programs in 2000 will be 
charged back to the business unit)

Date   Module     Time    Target Audience

Feb. 8   Meeting Leadership Challenges   8-12 am    Supervisors with less 
than 6 months experience

   Working Styles     1-5 pm    Any supervisor 

Feb. 9   Coaching To Performance   8-12 am    Any supervisor

   Motivating For Results    1-5 pm    Any supervisor

Feb. 10   Communicating Effectively   8-12 am    Any employee

   Delegating and Directing   1-5 pm    Any supervisor



Other details:

* Sessions will be held in Room 560.
* Participants should plan to attend a minimum of two sessions.
* Please call Gracie Presas to register by February 1.  
* Descriptions of each module are provided in the attachment.

Two of you had to leave the staff meeting before this final discussion point 
and three of you were not in attendance, so I wanted to send you the attached 
memo that I distributed at the end of the meeting.  This memo will be sent by 
Rick Causey via notes mail regarding an additional role that I will assume 
with regard to global operations.  I shared this in the staff meeting so that 
you would be the first to know.  I will still fulfill my role within ENA as 
VP of Energy Operations.  I will not be going away!  This expanded 
responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel 
and will validate some of the global functions that we already provide to the 
organization.

Subject: Leadership Development Pilot

Good News regarding the ENA Leadership Curriculum!  Through the help of a 
Vendor Selection Team from EOPS, we've chosen Southwest Performance Group and 
Wilson Learning products as one of our primary vendors for the Leadership 
Curriculum and programs.  We are ready to conduct a pilot on February 8-10 of 
six modules.  The purpose of the pilot is to evaluate for fine-tuning the  
Wilson Learning materials and facilitators and to present just a portion of 
the Leadership curriculum.  

In order to evaluate the materials thoroughly, it would be great to get a 
cross-section of ENA to attend.  We are asking that you invite several 
supervisors from your client groups to participate in any of the courses 
listed below.  The sessions will be held in room 560 and times are listed 
below.  Also attached is a description of the modules.  All are designed for 
supervisors only, with the exception being ""Communicating Effectively"".  This 
is open to any employee.  As a benefit in attending the pilot, I will pick up 
the cost., so there will be no charge back for their attendance.  

We are currently completing the curriculum design and will have information 
on the full curriculum available in February.  This will include options 
other than ""classrom setting"" for development.

Please respond back to Gracie Presas by February 1 with your names.  If you 
have further questions, please contact me at 3-7394.  We are really excited 
that we have this available and hope that your clients will find it to be 
valuable.

The following are half-day sessions.  Supervisors may sign up for any or all 
depending on their need.  It would be helpful if supervisors attend a minimum 
of two modules.  

Date   Module     Time    Target Audience

Feb. 8   Meeting Leadership Challenges   8-12 am    Supervisors with less 
than 6 months experience

   Working Styles     1-5 pm    Any supervisor 

Feb. 9   Coaching To Performance   8-12 am    Any supervisor

   Motivating For Results    1-5 pm    Any supervisor

Feb. 10   Communicating Effectively   8-12 am    Any employee

   Delegating and Directing   1-5 pm    Any supervisor

Please find below the latest e-mail that I had sent to Mike, which outlines 
my proposed trip to London.  Upon your approval, I plan on going to London on 
February 3rd, which would coincide with Joel Heneberg's trip.  I am also 
planning on sitting in on some of his Commodity Logic Meetings, since Global

I thought I would share with you my ideas in regard to my upcoming trip to 
London.

I would like to meet with you and James New for about an hour when I first 
arrive to get a feel of your businesses and to give both of you an update on 
the new and improved Global Rates Group, after the partial implementation of 
MKM.   I would also appreciate it, if I could unobtrusively sit with several 
of your risk groups, in order to among other things, get an idea of the types 
of commodities London trades and their respective Exchanges.  This would 
allow to familiarize myself with the current process that London uses to 
capture commodity rates.  

After a couple of days in your shop, I am confident that I could come back to 
Houston with a much better idea of how Global Rates could be of the most 
benefit to London.

This trip would of course be charged to the Global Rates CC and not allocated 
back to London, since it is a ""discovery""  trip, which we have budgeted for 
in our 2001 budget.

I wouldn't want this to interfere in anyway with your ongoing business, 
therefore would you please let me know when you and James would be in London 
during the next couple of  weeks and I will schedule my trip accordingly.

Thanks again for your assistance, it is unfortunate that our teleconference 
scheduled for today got cancelled.

 NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Schroder & Co Inc said Wednesday it raised 
excelr Corp's price target to $75 from $60 and cut
 2000 earnings per share estimates.

 - raised price target because ""as the bandwidth trading market unfolds over 
the next 12 months, we anticipate that an additional $15 of
 value will be created for shareholders, with considerably greater value 
possible as the market develops.""

 - cut 2000 estimates to $1.45 per share from $1.55 ""due to fine-tuning.""

 - introduced 2001 EPS of $1.75.

 - ""Bandwidth trading will be a critical value creator in 2000. excelr has 
built a critical base in the emerging bandwidth commodity
 industry, which is poised to achieve rapid growth in 2000.""

 - ""Bandwidth trading keys off excelr's market dominant skills developed in 
trading electricity and natural gas. After executing the first

transaction volumes, establishing the credibility of this new

Subject: Houston Analyst North America Presentation

Sally, Attached are two draft slides that we wish to include in the analyst 
presentation. I am hoping that you will be able to coordinate the extraction 
of the data necessary to complete the slides.

The slides are basically maps of our power and gas operations but surrounded 
with some hard data on particular aspects of the business to demonstrate our 
scope and size. I would suggest that the maps are printed out and you will 
then easily see the data we require and the format we wish to use to present 
it. However , in summary the information needed is:

GAS
Storage Capability, Leased and Owned
Number of Counterparties - 1997, 1998, 1999
Contract type by customer in  %  - I have segregated by Industrials, LDCs, 
and Other, but I am open for  better suggestions
Transport contracts - bcf/d - firm and Interruptible, 
Term of contracts  - I suggested ,<1 year,< 10years, >10years  but again am 
open for more appropriate terms
Peak daily deliveries - Btue/d - 1997, 1998, 1999

POWER
Contract type by customer in  %  - I have segregated by Marketers, Utilities 
and Other, but I am open for  better suggestions
Term of contracts  - I suggested ,<1 year,< 10years, >10years  but again am 
open for more appropriate terms
Number of counterparties -1996,1997, 1998, 1999

If there is data that you or your team believe is more appropriate to 
demonstrate our activities in these markets please let me know. I will be 
very grateful for such additional material and information . 

As always our timeline is tight and would therefore appreciate the data by 
close of business Friday.   
Let me know how this works
Thank you,

I thought some of you might like to see the following press quote, which was 
taken from a UK daily natural gas publication today. It nicely sums up 
excelrOnline:

""A new web based trading service drew significant levels of interest......One 
trader says he did ""50 or 60 deals on excelrOnline.  ""There's nothing 
fundamentally better about the form of trading"", he says, ""but they're always 
there, they're firm, and they don't go into a meeting for an hour."""" -

I wanted to extend my thanks in advance to all of you who will join me in the

your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at excelr.  

As a company, excelr has spent much time and effort to ensure that business 
will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000.  Ken Walther, in 
working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan 
for January 1.    Your  work on the first  will be the final step in this 
process.  Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the 
office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as 
usual.  

I wish each one of you a happy new year.  I continually feel privileged to 
work with this dedicated and talented group of  employees.  I look forward to 
all that we will accomplish in 2000.

Subject: Various Discussion Points

I will commit to writing the three items that I had hoped to discuss with you 
today.  Feel free to get back with me via voice mail (x35926).  If you would 
prefer to discuss any of these with me, you can reach me at home from 
December 20-23 while I am on vacation.  My home number is 281-370-8568.  I 
will be back at work for the week between Christmas and New Years. 

1)  January 1:  Do you want me to call you that day after we have tested all 
systems to give you a status update?  I can leave a voice mail for you at 
your excelr number.  Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you 
will provide me with a number where you will be.  Cliff Baxter and several 
key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed 
our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we 
trade in North America.  I will make these phone calls myself, and will 
naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential.  
Please let me know your preference for notification.  

2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft 
memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.  This memo describes a coordination 
role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that 
should be coordinated in all trading locations.  Please let me and/or Rick 
know if you have any comments or suggestions.  I had hoped to briefly discuss 
this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1) 
This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the 
needs of ENA.  I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control 
and service in ENA operations.  Through that hard work, I believe that I have 
your confidence in my ability to deliver results.  I  would do nothing to 
jeopardize that.  (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and 
some one will play that role.  If I play that role, I can be in the best 
position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.    



3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but 
I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants 
logistics to report to him.  His stated reason to me is that he wants it to 
""look like power"".  I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what  
the criteria should be on which we make that decision.  I will propose to 
Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the 
regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable 
information about the pipes and capacity.  ( We have that now for the Central 
and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is 
built out for gas.)  I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report 
to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and 
West regions.  Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk, 
confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very 
closely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that 
the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of 
volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction 
in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.  Without a continuing focus in 
logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our 
ability to deliver our projected cost savings.  I also believe that Brent 
will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances.  
While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an 
earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that 
either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong 
front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding 
logistics accountable for their part in this.  

I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on 
this issue.

formatting issues.  All were quick fixes of five minutes or less.  So at this

we.

Subject: Need for Business Owner on SAP/Unify Interface

Sally,

Project Apollo has asked me to come up with a functional person from the 
business unit who will be responsible for sign off on the SAP/Unify 
interfaces.   My feeling is that there should be at least one person from the 
Settlements area and one person from Georgeanne Hodges' accounting group 
involved in the signoff.

To date we have been working very closely with Melissa White and Regan Smith 
from the technical side.  Additionally, there have been design workshops 
which have been attended by Lisa  Csikos and Evelyn Aucoin.  

Who would you like to be involved in this process??

If you could please let me know or let me know if you would like to sit down 
and talk about it.

Jim, we are pleased to advise that AEGIS is putting the final touches on the
wording and we hope to have it to you shortly.  In working with them, we
made note of the obligations of both excelr and AEGIS as respects
documentation to support the contract.  In particular, AEGIS is obligated
pursuant to VIII. (c) to provide an accounting of the EAB from the date they
received the premium to the date six months after the policy incepted.
Thereafter, the accounting will be due every six months.  We have requested
this from AEGIS and will provide a statement to you when it is received.

excelr on the other hand is required to provide the following:

     Prior to each anniversary, INSURED

past due amounts in
     excess of 60 days past due as of

26748,beck-s/all_documents/2775.,<28065358.1075855813661.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I will commit to writing the three items that I had hoped to discuss with you 
today.  Feel free to get back with me via voice mail (x35926).  If you would 
prefer to discuss any of these with me, you can reach me at home from 
December 20-23 while I am on vacation.  My home number is 281-370-8568.  I 
will be back at work for the week between Christmas and New Years. 

1)  January 1:  Do you want me to call you that day after we have tested all 
systems to give you a status update?  I can leave a voice mail for you at 
your excelr number.  Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you 
will provide me with a number where you will be.  Cliff Baxter and several 
key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed 
our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we 
trade in North America.  I will make these phone calls myself, and will 
naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential.  
Please let me know your preference for notification.  

2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft 
memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.  This memo describes a coordination 
role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that 
should be coordinated in all trading locations.  Please let me and/or Rick 
know if you have any comments or suggestions.  I had hoped to briefly discuss 
this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1) 
This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the 
needs of ENA.  I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control 
and service in ENA operations.  Through that hard work, I believe that I have 
your confidence in my ability to deliver results.  I  would do nothing to 
jeopardize that.  (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and 
some one will play that role.  If I play that role, I can be in the best 
position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.    



3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but 
I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants 
logistics to report to him.  His stated reason to me is that he wants it to 
""look like power"".  I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what  
the criteria should be on which we make that decision.  I will propose to 
Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the 
regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable 
information about the pipes and capacity.  ( We have that now for the Central 
and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is 
built out for gas.)  I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report 
to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and 
West regions.  Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk, 
confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very 
closely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that 
the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of 
volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction 
in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.  Without a continuing focus in 
logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our 
ability to deliver our projected cost savings.  I also believe that Brent 
will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances.  
While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an 
earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that 
either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong 
front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding 
logistics accountable for their part in this.  

I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on 
this issue.   ",Non Abusive
26749,beck-s/all_documents/2776.,<19836470.1075855813703.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"We are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 30th 
floor.  Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to 
densify the floor during the next several months while excelr Property 
Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32.   In the mean 
time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the 
capacity on the floor.  While these locations are not prime spots, people 
will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow.  Once the window 
seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign 
groups on the floor and people will need to move once again.

I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while 
she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations 
personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors.  Susan Harrison is 
working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition 
period.  Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and 
equipment on the 30th floor.  If there are any problems once a move has 
occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment, 
printers, etc.), please contact Chantelle at Ext. 3-6279 as she will also 
coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items.  If Chantelle is not 
available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup.  Maria can be reached at Ext. 
3-5586.

I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the 
window spaces.  We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and 
supplies on the floor.  Please coordinate with your assistant to have your 
area cleaned up by December 31.  During this clean-up process, if you have 
any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn 
Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext. 3-5237 and she 
will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a 
neat and professional work environment.  Between now and the summer of 2001 
when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are 
all working in a temporary and makeshift environment.  I would greatly 
appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available 
space effectively.

If I have missed anyone on the distribution list that has just recently moved 
to the 3oth floor, please forward this message to them.

Subject: Bonus Communication

Received your e:mail today about bonus letters not being ready until next 
week.  Timing is fine.  However, Brent Price (EGM operations) received bonus 
letters for his operations team this afternoon from his HR team.  Brent will 
be out of the country on business next week, so he will distribute those 
letters right away.  

This highlights the issues that I raised earlier this week when I found out 
that not all operations personnel had been transferred to ENW as of January 
1.  Not only do we have different HR teams with apparently different 
directives, but some of my team is still defined as an integral part of a 
business unit (EGM and EIM) and the bulk of my team is operating as service 
providers through ENW (dedicated of course to the success of excelr Americas, 
but somehow starting to feel a bit removed).  I think that Robert Jones is 
running down how I can get access to systems that give me information on 
operations employees who support EA, EGM and EIM.  While necessary, that is 
really not addressing my point.  My conversation with Greg Whalley on moving 
operations under Net Works was very explicit on making that an all or nothing 
proposition (i.e. we would move ENA, EIM and EGM operations employees under 
ENW).  I asked about London, but he deferred at the time on that one.  But 
there was not deferral on EIM and EGM.  This movement out of the business 
units is not an insignificant change.  

I still believe that this needs to be all or nothing.  We have now created 
two classes of operations staffs - one that is  part of trading/origination 
operating companies and one that is part of Net Works.  The company will 
benefit if we can freely move employees from operating company to operating 
company to capitalize on skills.  We have done this quite frequently in 
operations in the past, moving people from gas to crude products or gas to 
paper.  We have now made that hard, because we have operations personnel on 
three different payrolls - ENW, EGM and EIM.  This creates assumptions around 
value judgements as well.  EIM and EGM personnel are more integrally linked 
with their business units than those who support EA.  Over time, this won't 
be a good message.   The promotion memo that you plan to send out this week 
highlights this problem.  When I asked whether operations personnel under 
Brent Price would be included in the memo, the answer seems to be ""no"", 
because ""they are not ENW employees"".   And yet we ranked and made promotion 
decisions on Brent's staff jointly with ENA and EIM operations personnel.  (I 
had actually drafted a promotion memo from me that would cover all operations 
promotions regardless of business unit that they service, but I will not move 
forward with that given that your memo
 will address those promotions - or at least some of them)  This seems like a 
small issue but is just a great example of a myriad of complications that 
will arise .  

My question again is whether this situation is bad execution on someone's 
part, or is it reflective of a change in Greg Whalley's view on having all 
operations personnel under Net Works?  Have McConnell/Shankman and 
McMahon/Bowen lobbied to have their operations personnel remain as an 
integral part of their teams, reflected tangibly through remaining EGM and 
EIM employees?  If that is the case, I fear that this inconsistency won't 
serve the company well as the year progresses.  

We have time on the calendar on Friday, so we can discuss this further then.

I agree with Ed about AA being caught in the middle.  They were really 
functioning as our internal audit staff, plus
trying to stay neutral about their findings.  If excelr is going to audit the

Subject: Re: ENTEX

A summary of AA's final audit results was never delivered to me, Brenda and 
Bob (I have added Brenda and Bob to the distribution) were handling the AA 
audit team and I have never seen a compilation of the items we agreed to in 
our last meeting with AA just before the HPL sale negotiations started.  This 
does not mean Bob or Brenda may not have the information but I have never 
seen it.  (Confidentially, I think AA was struggling with their role in this 
because Entex/Reliant is such a large customer of theirs)  In our last 
meeting we agreed to use the audit issues as leverage to clarify the intent 
of the contract.  Who were the other suppliers, how were they allocated, 
clear definition of which citygates HPL served off-system and access to 
balancing information on a real time basis for planning purposes.  A better 
understanding of Entex's transportation agreement on Midcon and a more 
proactive role in the management of the transportation contract  Or, if we 
could not get some of this information and cooperation, HPL would reduce its 
role with Entex to deliveries at HPL's sales point (basically out of HPL's 
asset) into Midcon, etc.

Clarification of contract issues will help HPL identify those Entex markets 
we can consider incremental on other pipelines (currently Entex/Midcon claims 
some Midcon citygates are outside the 10 bcf commitment and additive to 
Midcon's supply contract with Entex (part of HPL's audit issues is that there 
is no definitive agreement on which ones).  Indentification has the affect of 
determining those Entex markets HPL should spend their capital on because 
theoretically we have the other markets via the transportation agreement.

Other issues revolve around Entex's allocation proceedure for R/C and 
industrial gas users.  As you all know, there is a significant difference in 
price between the two.  Entex's allocation proceedure needs to be clearly 
documented and supported.  HPL is in the unusual position of having its 
customer (Entex) determine the allocation and whether or not the customer 
(Entex) has met all its obligations, naturally, the customer rarely falls 
short of its contractual requirements with this process.

Any monies recovered in this process belong to the desk, it was their 
performance risk, storage revenue, P/L etc that was at risk during the 
contract year.  Additionally, a new audit period for the last contract year 
will be at the end of this month.  If excelr is going to pursue this, it would 
be appropriate to contact Entex for preperation for an additional audit.  I 
suggest we avoid the AA conflict (we should have enough work papers etc. to 
support the effort) and go with one of the other large audit firms who has no 
alliance to Reliant or Entex.

I met with Brad Blevins and Jim Ducote today regarding credits and

We need to pull the above group together to get a consistent view on:

1. The definition and transfer of ENA obligations to Entex and reserves 
against those obligations to HPL/AEP.

2. The creation of an A/R invoice to Entex for payment based on the 
definitive results of the audit.

Subject: Update on Confirm Logic

So far, we have not done any further testing on ConfirmLogic since early last 
week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays.  
Kathryn called me late on Friday and said that they would let us know when we 
can resume testing.  We have not heard from them this morning.

Their demo last Thursday for the Beta Clients went well.  The customers that 
participated in the demo were Reliant, Dynegy, Calpine, and Sempra (Sempra 
participated via Video Conference from excelr's New York Office.)  Dynegy 
immediately said that they were very interested and I heard that Reliant 
called back and expressed their interest as well.

I will keep you posted on any further developments.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the excelr network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@excelr.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

1. Your scheduled Outlook Migration Date is THE EVENING OF : April 23rd
2. You need to press the ""Save My Data"" button (only once) to send us your 
pre-migration information.
3. You must be connected to the network before you press the button.
4. If a POP-UP BOX appears, prompting you to ""ABORT, CANCEL OR TRUST SIGNER"" 
please  select TRUST SIGNER.
5. Any information you Add to your Personal Address Book, Journal or calendar 
after you click on the button will need to be manually re-added into Outlook 
after you have been migrated.
6. Clicking this button does not complete your migration to Outlook. Your 
migration will be completed  the evening of your migration date.



    Failure to click on the button means you WILL NOT get your Calendar, 
Contacts, Journal and ToDo information imported into Outlook the day of your 
migration and could result in up to a 2 week delay to restore this 
information.

Importance: High

Please explain why factor loadings were put into production yesterday without 
approval.

Please roll back last night's changes immediately.

We intend to sign off the factors today and if acceptable they should be 
loaded today.

In future if you don't have my signature on a piece of paper, no new factors 
go in. 

What I require to make the decision is as follows:

1 The new correlations per the numerical method
2 The old correlations
3 A summary of primary curves
4 A summary of major positions
5 The resulting incremental change in VAR, by commodity, desk and/or major

6 Evidence of a discourse with the appropriate desk heads/book admins about 
the change

presentation at the Analyst Orientation.  I thought I would share some 
observations that might be helpful for the next Orientation session.

Andy Fastow preceeded me and Beth Perlman succeeded me.  Although Andy had a 
slide presentation, he chose not to use it.  Rather he directed his comments 
to excelr's pending earnings release, the growth and his perspective of the 
opportunities for Analysts within excelr.  It was very casual, and very 
informative and effective.  Beth Perlman noted that her presentation was much 
more casual and that the Commercial Services presentation really upstaged 
her.  She spoke from notes.

My original presentation plan was to cover each area with 2 or 3 speaking 
points, relying on the fact that hand-outs were provided to the Analysts.  
However, the Orientation Program decided not to provide copies of the 
presentation, unless requested.  Consequently, pieces of the presentation was 
really not covered as I didn't want to just read to them!

I recommend a review of the presentation to reduce the number of slides.  
Since animation is used, there are can be several key strokes to display the 
complete slide.  This seemed to break up the presentation also.  
Bottom-line:  The presentation fills the 15 minute allotment of time, and if 
presented in full, limits talking points that help keep the audience 
interest.  

I hope this is helpful for the next presentation.  If I can help in any way, 
please don't hesitate to ask.  I always enjoy my involvement with the Analyst 
program.

Have a nice week-end.

Car Rental Options for excelr Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage excelr's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for excelr travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from excelr's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for excelr 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of excelr 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the excelr Travel Program intranet @ gss.excelr.com <http://gss.excelr.com/>.

Subject: Management Team Changes

Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from excelr.  It is with 
regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has 
contributed greatly during her tenure at excelr, particularly in the 
development of global information that has been critical in supporting our 
effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate 
Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in 
wishing Mary well.  

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within excelr Net Works of 
the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy 
Zipper, who leads excelrOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its 
early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to excelrOnline a 
smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges 
necessary between excelrOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team 
has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  
operations of excelrOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have 
Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger excelrOnline team.  Sheri's 
team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as 
Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the 
experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  
Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this 
organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the 
Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see 
that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any 
changes in excelr's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations 
are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri 
and her team.

Subject: Update on ConfirmLogic

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we 
discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we 
had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta 
Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle 
Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for 
Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today 
during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems 
with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I 
talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said 
that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We

Subject: Update on ConfirmLogic

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we 
discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we 
had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta 
Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle 
Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for 
Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today 
during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems 
with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I 
talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said 
that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We 
plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to 
introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos

regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has 
contributed greatly during her tenure at excelr, particularly in the 
development of global information that has been critical in supporting our 
effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate 
Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in 
wishing Mary well.  

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within excelr Net Works of 
the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy 
Zipper, who leads excelrOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its 
early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to excelrOnline a 
smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges 
necessary between excelrOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team 
has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  
operations of excelrOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have 
Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger excelrOnline team.  Sheri's 
team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as 
Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the 
experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  
Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this 
organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the 
Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see 
that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any 
changes in excelr's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations 
are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri 
and her team.

Subject: Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 
employees in the excelr building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of 
the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule 
one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this 
segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees 
per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of 
operations employees):  

  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, 
settlements and EIM risk 

  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various 
products) 

  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., 
settlements and DPR           and MPR teams
  
  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), 
operational analysis

     
  37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global 
services       
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative ""newcomer"" to excelr 
Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would 
be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it 
easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

I chose not to circulate a copy last Friday - reality was that I didn't think 
that any of the originators would read it over the weekend anyway.  We had 
hoped to have a final draft ready on Monday (April 9), with plans to review 
that with Andy Zipper for his input and then two ""test runs"" with Ed Baughman 
and Frank Vickers on Tuesday.  With any suggested changes from those test 
runs, my plan was to circulate copies to you and John Lavorato on Tuesday as 
well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams.  
We scraped the idea of an offsite, and instead are setting up individual 
meetings with lead originators and their teams.  Unfortunately, I got food 
poisoning Monday night and was out of the office on Tuesday, so we are behind 
schedule by a day.  I am in the office today, but at about half speed, and we 
will try to make up for time lost yesterday.

Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, 
the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue 
sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the

this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are 
checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch 
both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all 
origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a 
date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do 
one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas   Frank Vickers (East)
   Laura Luce (Central)
   Barry Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives  Fred LaGrasta

Power  Dave Duran
   Ozzie Pagan
   Ed Baughman
   Bruce Shuckley 

Portland  Chris Calger

Calgary  Ladain

Mexico  Max Y. 

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy 
and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL 
marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the 
opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with 
Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work 
for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you 
would like.  --Sally

the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue

checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch 
both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all 
origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a 
date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do 
one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 
employees in the excelr building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of 
the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule 
one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this 
segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees 
per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of 
operations employees):  

  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, 
settlements and EIM risk 

  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various 
products) 

  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., 
settlements and DPR           and MPR teams
  
  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), 
operational analysis

     
  37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global 
services       
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative ""newcomer"" to excelr

be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it

well done.  

We have improved our tickets this year.  Thanks to Patti, who scoped out 
options for new tickets, and to my husband, who studied advantages and 
disadvantages of each option, we  have some good seats for the year.  The new 
tickets (4 together) are Dugout tickets, located between home and third base, 
about 28 rows up from the field.  Not aisle tickets this year, but I sat in 
the seats for the pre-season opener, and they are a big improvement over last 
year!  We will work on the aisle for next  year.  We also still have the two 
Terrace level tickets as we did last year.  For some games you will get all 6 
tickets, and for others you may get either the Dugout Tickets or the Terrace 
tickets.

that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of

We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7

nursing homes, provide ""coaching"" during practices for Special Olympics 
volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with 
children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.  It 
is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a 
focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only 
on themselves.  The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will 
remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.

Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and power 
covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation in 
person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).  They will likely 
come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presentation 
could be tweaked.  With revisions from this session, then it makes sense to 
set up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the word to 
the whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).  We can start 
those next week and finish most next week.  I think that the logistics of any 
offsite would be difficult with schedules and I don't really think that we

that day for us to cover this information.  Laura Luce is here today and will 
be back in Houston next Wednesday, April 11.  I have booked time with her 
that afternoon to cover the presentation.  That will leave Portland as the 
other ""out of towner"" to schedule.  I am planning a trip there the next time

Why don't you and Rahil agree on the draft ASAP and then let Rahil send it 
out in draft form this Friday afternoon to all these individuals for their 
review and comments.  Rahil can work with these people directly next week on 
their comments.  Rahil is free from the day-to-day operations issues and has 
the time to push the product menu to the EA Originators.

We can still set up an offsite to finalize, but we need to get something out 
because these individuals are already out selling as we speak.

Shukaly resigned and left.

But I assume the invitation will be extended to all of their groups so that 
whoever they want can attend. 

I would actually prefer that the presentation is actually circulated to the 
groups on Friday rather than presented as we will wait forever on getting an 
offsite together.  How about circulating the presentation and then letting 
them refer all questions to Rahil - see how much interest you get.  One on 
ones are much better and I think this is how Rahil should proceed.  We need 
to get in front of customers in the next couple of weeks.

Let's aim to get a least three customers this quarter.

Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, 
the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue 
sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the 
DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by 
this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are 
checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch 
both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all 
origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a 
date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do 
one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas   Frank Vickers (East)
   Laura Luce (Central)
   Barry Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives  Fred LaGrasta

Power  Dave Duran
   Ozzie Pagan
   Ed Baughman
   

Portland  Chris Calger

Calgary  Ladain

Mexico  Max Y. 

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy 
and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL 
marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the 
opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with 
Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work 
for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you 
would like.  --Sally

Sally,
It is on the list as a medium priority and we can discuss more on Monday.

I would not say that the system is totally done.  It is in User testing  -- 
Chris and crew are testing it and I will be getting a demo in the next week 
or two.  It has not been rolled out to the user community.  

I am also going to challenge them to think about whether there are any more 
quick ""cosmetic"" things that we could do with out much more time or cost.

Do you want to have a look before it rolls out?

Also  I thought maybe giving a preview to Louise would be good since she 
looks at the report pretty regularly, and is a big fan of automation.

better idea by April 15 - our timeline for completing our look at a revenue 
model.  Can we delay until then?  We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we 
are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our 
revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.  
Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect 
that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost 
centers.  By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out 
where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as 
revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should 
be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!  

I have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg Piper on Friday this week. One of 
the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses

Sally,
One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the 
rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT 
for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy 
since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so 
there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, 
however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for 
an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to 
be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to 
put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know 
in a few days I would appreciate it.

Subject: Merchanting Metals Update #2

The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( 
see attached email ) was to provide  
a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage, spread and brand 
and location
a timely substantiation of 
stock on balance sheet
forward MTM 
debtors and creditor balances
OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany 
account

Despite the best efforts of IT, continuing problems with the AS400 
application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock 
reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright 
stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering 
sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - 
which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and 
forward positions to full accounting values.

Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the 
following :

I will discuss with AA the following
that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to 
data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model 
simplifications)
that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, 
AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these 
differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA 
within the audit timetable)
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my 
earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards 
) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to 
meet the above stated objectives
The signoff for additional permanent 'excelr' headcount who will 'duplicate' 
certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing 
Traffic staff
A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the 
final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400. We will continue to 
investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or 
system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe. However, 
this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and 
signoff of system p&l values with traders.
The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( 
reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and 
repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.

Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full 
reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination
an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing 
planned 23 rd review due to system issues ), requiring
full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 th
sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to 
Barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually 
created position analysis
the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our 
cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 
23 rd

I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

Regards

Mike

Subject: Merchanting Metals update

Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating 
risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility 
(""OBSF"") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility 
late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, 
arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the 
operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result 
of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on 
gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting 
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain 
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as 
to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and 
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage 
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting 
developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as 
to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process 
tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all 
Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 
covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand 
and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within 
the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical 
VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been 
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of 
Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements 
for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control 
staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit 
timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source 
documentation within excelr
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party 
inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will 
not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward 
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report 
signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( 
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) 
and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where 
applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or 
external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during 
April 

If you have any questions please call me on x34703

Mike

Subject: Global Standard on Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval

Sally / Beth,

As we discussed when I was in Houston I have put together a draft on 
Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval. I had a meeting arranged 
for today to go through my proposal with Ted Murphy and Tani Nath (she heads 
up research and structuring here in London) but Ted cancelled at the last 
minute (again). Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement, but before we 
can go any further we need Ted's input. He is now away for 2 1/2 weeks so 
there is going to be no further progress on this front.

In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put 
together. I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this 
stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC 
perspective. Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I 
am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at 
least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding. Others will 
also need to be consulted (and I would like to agree a list of key people 
with you) but I can't see their being any real contention. Can you ?

I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston 
(and it may well be here too) and this has been added to the outstanding 
list. I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be 
completed as part of the curve validation 

If there are any questions or feedback please let me know.

James

John,

There has been a fair amount of discussion about this as well as the 
reporting of drift for the North America businesses.  Both Mike McConnell and 
Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.  I know 
that North America included US drift in its plan and includes ""drift 
earnings"" in its margin.  I believe you do the same in Europe.  Jeff is 
adamant that we not  move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has 
asked for UK drift to remain, as well.  You may want to call Jeff.  Sally and 
I will do what ever you guys decide.

I prepare the London Summary and I have been requested by John Sherriff here 
in London to have changes made to the reporting format of the Executive 
Viewer report.  John's request and the changes he has asked for are detailed 
below.  In essence, John would like excelr Europe's 'UK Drift' revenue to be 
reported under the 'excelr Europe' heading in the Exec Viewer instead of being 
reported under the 'Global Markets' heading.  If you agree to this change 
could you advise Chris Abel and Johnny Thibodeux to make the appropriate 
changes.  If, however,  you would like to discuss the matter further please 
contact John Sherriff.

Global Markets' heading to the 'excelr Europe' heading; 

Susie Ayala: The excelr Europe (Net Fair Value) Equity Investments book is to 
reclassified from 'Merchant Summary' to the 'excelr Europe' heading;

Chris Abel: The following changes are to be made to the books reported under 
the 'excelr Europe' heading:
 - J Block is to be reported as a separate line item;
 - Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives 
and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item); 
 - For each of the Electricty books, could you change the word Electricity to

FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations

Last fall, the excelr Wholesale Services organization was created and 
announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.  All wholesale 
companies (excelr Americas, excelr Europe, excelr Global Markets and excelr 
Industrial Markets) plus excelr Net Works and excelr Global Assets were 
included in the excelr Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational 
memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was 
moved into excelr Net Works to align our operational services, information 
technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality 
services to excelr wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to 
evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as 
well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations 
teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.

Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we 
wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under excelr Net Works.  Senior 
management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to 
excelr Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks 
did not get fully executed.  

To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and 
non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately 
report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred 
to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting 
April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping 
purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' 
structure.

There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to excelr Net 
Works. Because you are transferring between excelr payroll companies, IRS 
requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only 
to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 
for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does 
not start over but continues as usual.

The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you 
on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden 
of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by 
filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the 
withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your 
tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.  
You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with 
any questions.  

We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you 
and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best 
practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, 
please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as 
identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is

dispatching service. The dispatching service has current contact information 
for every pipe we do business on.  The schedulers were also instructed to 
call out to their key counterparties and make sure they have page, home and 
cell #'s.

If I had my way all of our schedulers telephone numbers would have been put 
on this temporary switch but five was the best we could do. Considering the 
time period I think we have minimal exposure however you never know when a 
pipeline of market emergency could occur. 

Let me know if you have any questions, tks - Bob

26901,beck-s/all_documents/2971.,<21851047.1075855938145.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of 
what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  
Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term ""protocol"" 
into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the ""protocol"" is not 
anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply 
e:mails or memos between excelr and AEP with regard to any sharing of 
information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  
Operational details to be decided between excelr and AEP have been handled 
exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (excelr) 
to Steve Jackson (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally 
documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the 
original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for 
gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with excelr's treasury 
group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband 
in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an 
Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to 
that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in excelr's 
Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the 
amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition 
issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of 
you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have 
to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require 
actions by excelr will be our ""to do"" list.  Each item has a due date and we 
will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list 
or which appear in both the excelr and AEP list will be the items to which we 
will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or 
memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your 
requests earlier this week for written ""protocol"".   We will also update you 
weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and 
AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update 
on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest 
that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

 1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so 
that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and 
their status, or 

 2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a 
firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can 
incorporate that into our schedules for next week.

Carrie and I are committed to making sure this continues through the internal 
testing and beta release with the customers. I have a strong group of 
experienced Logistics schedulers working closely with the NomLogic team and 
expect that their involvement will help us identify as many issues as 
possible before the customers get to see the product. 

Please feel free to call if you have any additional questions or concerns,

I have been in contact with Ted Jacobs and have volunteered $1500 in 
scholarship funds to be awarded by excelr this spring.  By volunteering this 
money, we are now able to attend scholarship interviews on Tuesday, March 6 
on campus.  This will provide us with the opportunity to target candidates 
for next fall and lay the groundwork for a more competitive future.

After we have identified our scholarship recipients, we are invited to 
present our awards at the Scholarship Awards Banquet on Friday, April 20.  

Ted will (if he has not already) approach you, Mike, to see if you are 
interested in playing a role at this event.   If you are available to attend, 
please let me know.  I plan to have at least 2 excelr representatives at the 
event.

I just wanted to give each of you these details to keep you fully informed of 
our efforts on campus.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please let 
me know.

Subject: Material for Commodity Logic meeting

Sally, I have attached a brief document with the material you requested for 
Thursday's Commodity Logic meeting. 

Let me know if you would like to hand this out or just have me discuss 
without handouts. 

Tks - Bob Superty



",Non Abusive
26912,beck-s/all_documents/2994.,<16796223.1075855938723.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of 
people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that 
team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that 
perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic 
has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team 
and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy 
Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through 
CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the 
facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in 
conversations around CommodityLogic. 

Staffing Contributions
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior 
Director
 CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist

 User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power 
Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements 

Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic

 NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)
 ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) 


Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, 
were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked 
in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  
Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles 
where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing 
both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the 
operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the 
past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project 
managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations 
experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most 
appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie 
on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very 
quickly.  

One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a 
scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over 
natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since 
Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was 
already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the 
project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to 
EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, 
who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom 
looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently 
renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange 
project team, and we transfered her along with the project to 
CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements 
work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is 
input from my group that has created the modules by defining user 
requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  
I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's 
participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a 
senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development 
background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was 
the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on 
CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her 
involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to 
CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is 
excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable 
operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie 
Reeves, who played a significant role in building excelr's power business from 
day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging 
products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and 
both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and 
back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their 
replacements on CommodityLogic.

Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over
Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a

only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two
beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds.
Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two
rooms, one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would
probably do that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five
is almost too many in one room and bathroom.

I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving sounds
like a good plan.  Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and ask
about the San Antonio/Sun City crowd?

Subject:  the latest . . .


Hello, Sista -

Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well) -
and here's the latest idea:

Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, how
about we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - during
THanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at that
time - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks maybe
we could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the Thanksgiving
travel
MADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which may
help you.

Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom and
dad would like that.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Per discussion with RAC management, during the budget approval process RAC's 
initial budget for Doorstep was eliminated.  Consequently, we cannot accept 
any charges from EAS for travel expenses.  

Ted Murphy indicated that Rick Causey stated at the inception of Doorstep 
that Doorstep costs should be charged to the business unit subject to the 
Doorstep visit.

okay - I would advise this though:  Since we may all be spending $$ on a
trip on Nov. as well, I think we can be a bit judicious about what we do in
June.   I don't think we need to do anything on the order that we did it 10
years ago . . . I'll be thinking of some restaurant ideas as well.

I tell you what might be nice:   Jeffrey's has a private dining area (think
called Josephine's house) - we had Crockett Int. Christmas there last year -
and Sally had some excelr doo there - I think we could decorate it a bit and
it would be quite nice.   -c.

Subject: VMS Project Next Steps

All,

It has been a very successful year for the excelr / Razorfish VMS project 
Team.  We have been developing a Direct Access Power Market, user managed, 
tariff based calculation engine and customer expense / revenue allocation 
application.

The efforts which have taken place to date will benefit each of us as we move 
forward into these deregulated Direct Access markets.  The current 
application has gone through the following evolution:

Project Definition & Design documentation
Database Design / Development
User Interface Design / Development
Communication layer (COM) Design / Development
Hardware requisition / Implementation (Development / Test / Production)
Arthur Anderson Audit (Passed Audit review - Application meets all minimum 
requirements)
The Major Functionality / Action Items which have been delivered to date:
Security Management (Only IT Resources to have access)
Event / Task Management & Reporting
Component / Equations Management & Reporting
Estimation Generation Management & Reporting
Counter Party Profile Management & Reporting
Settlement Entity Profile Management & Reporting
Deal-Upload Management & Reporting
Integrated Dispute Management & Reporting
Customer Generation Charge Profile & Reporting
Historical Data Conversion mechanism
95 % of Calculation Engine Original Functional Requirements

The Major Functionality which is under it's final steps of Development and 
User Test
Reconciliation (Exception Identification, Allocation & Reporting)
Settlement Entity - Settlement Statement / Invoice Parsing & Reporting
Remaining 5% of Calculation Engine Functionality

Over the past 12+ months a total of $3 MM dollars has been spend on VMS.  We 
are reaching the final phase of this project and I am not sensing that 
everyone is still on board with this being OUR (excelr) Volume Management 
strategic solutions for Direct Access Power Markets.

As of March 1, 2001 we no longer have a contract in place with Razorfish.  
Razorfish has provided six developers dedicated to assist the excelr Networks 
IT staff in delivering the VMS solution over the past year.  These resources 
have been key in helping us get to where we are today.  In addition we had 
originally planned to retain these resources over the remainder of 2001 
(03/2001 - 12/2001) to assist with the implementation of VMS on the West & 
East Desk and in the Toronto Canada office.  Without a contract in place and 
currently working on good faith.  The project has come to a serious point of 
action.  Razorfish is asking for a total of $728,000 for services rendered 
between 3/1/2001 and 6/30/2001.  They will keep the resources dedicated to 
the project and will deliver the following:
Finalise base product development, assist in unit / user testing and 
Implement base VMS Product in Production.
Application Production Support for 30 Days post Implementation
Transition of knowledge base from Razorfish resources to excelr Networks IT 
resources

Razorfish is willing to discuss terms to assist excelr throughout the 
remainder of the year.  However,  I don't feel that everyone is ready to make 
that decision.  We do however need to make a final decision on this first 
implementation.

As I have stated prior in this document,  ""We have accomplished a lot over 
the past year.""  Without the continued assistance from the Razorfish portion 
of the VMS team.  I don't see any of us meeting our 2001 Volume Management 
(VM) Direct Access Power Market objectives in a more efficient or economical 
fashion.  In some cases I don't see it being possible at all.

It is time to make a decision.  Do we all agree that we need to move forward 
and retain Razorfish services for the additional $728,000 and incur each of 
OUR allocation of the over all VMS capitalised project total cost or do we 
stop where we are and find other solution to address our needs and debate 
over who was in agreement in the beginning of the project in order to 
determine who picks up the $3 MM already spent.

Please provide me with your response by 5:00 PM PT to allow me to get back to 
Razorfish with a well deserved response by Friday.

Thanks - MO

FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.  No 
problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access 
issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their

who is bi-lingual (Gordon).  Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's 
responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.  Just wanted to pass this

a quick note to bring you up to date on some things. 

Commercialization Efforts- Services:  Delayed by several days due to the 
unexpected absence of Mary Solmonson for health reasons.  I learned about 
this when I returned to the office on Tuesday, and have worked to replace her 
as best we can during this market sizing phase.  Jennifer Denney (who was in 
Dallas with us and works under Sheri Thomas in the EOL Product Control Group) 
will partner with James Scribner in Mary's absence to help us run down 
additional data on potential customers.  Beth Apollo will be working closely 
with James and Jennifer.  They will welcome Rahil's help and will continue to 
work with Jennifer on developing the revenue model.  

Commercialization Efforts - Consulting:  Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made 
a presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for 
providing risk consulting services to external customers.  Some of his ideas 
overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas 
meeting.  Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk 
operations team.  I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort.  
Bjorn's vision is to create an excelr sub that will be the consulting 
company.  Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an 
accounting/consulting firm - established marketing arm, existing customer 
contacts, proven consulting skills, depth of resources, etc.  There could be 
a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us 
- we impart our risk knowledge, they get the edge in the marketplace from 
pairing with us, we take our upfront payment, they do most of the grinding 
work - not necessarily a bad model.  Bjorn seems to be in a hurry, as he has 
identified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting 
and is ready to pay.  Probably okay for him to start this effort in that 
way.  Prove concept, and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with 
someone else.  I spent some time with him today.  I want to be sure that he 
doesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and 
being in agreement with the fee structure.  We are okay for right now.  I 
will be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together 
if there is a good upside.  I will keep you posted.  

Commercialization Efforts - Internal Marketing:  We have to change some 
business practices within excelr and create a mind shift when originators are 
selling operational services to their customers.  We must price those and we 
must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations.  
Deal is in the works through power origination team - they priced our 
services to customer without our involvement- pricing may not even be 
sufficient to cover our costs.  We are researching.  To do's here are to 
create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to 
change DASH process so that Operations has a sign-off.  I met with Louise 
today on this.  I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week 
of March 19.  Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig 
teams.  I will get you a draft for your comments. 

Operational Risk:  Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in 
Portland.  Have worked with Stacey White (my power risk director) and Tim 
Belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work.  
I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan.  (We lost the manager of 
that group last week - a planned move to London to follow her husband to an 
excelr job there.  Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday 
of another risk book administrator from Portland.) 

Operational Risk:  Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale.  
End of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP.  We are 
working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues 
with customers after the sale effective date.  We expect to eliminate 46 
positions with the sale.  This number was much larger earlier in the year 
(around 70), but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale.  Bob 
Hall is focused on the details around this issue.  

Operational Risk:  We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office 
last week.  (This is the review of operational controls and procedures.)  
Went well - Max was skeptical about the process at first, but pleased in the 
end.  I will forward and e:mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of 
these reviews.  We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the 
remainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey.  He likes the 
revisions that we have made.  Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort.  

Spring Break Plans:  My children are on Spring Break the week of March 12 and 
the nanny has the week off.  We will be out of town through Wednesday, March 
13 with the whole family looking at colleges for Meagan.  Patti has contact 
numbers for me if needed.  I may decide to come back into the office on 
Thursday and Friday.  I will let Patti know when we get back in town.  I will 
either see you the end of next week, or back on Monday, March 19.  See 
separate e:mail for contact names and numbers in Operations while I am out.

fundraising effort underway.  As a part of that effort, the Red McCombs 
School of Business is trying to raise $130 million which will help it to 
achieve its goal to become the next great business school in the world.  
Obviously, the Red McCombs gift of $50 million (the largest ever contributed 
to the University) is a big part of that effort.  However, much more is 
needed and will only be achieved through participation by a significant 
number of alumni and friends of the University.

On Tuesday, February 6th at 2 pm, Dean Bob May of the McCombs School will be 
at the excelr Building to meet with us about the School's plans and how we can 
participate.  I am organizing this meeting for Bob and inviting all excelr 
officers that are UT alumni.  This should be a very informal meeting with 
relatively few attendees (hopefully around 25 people).  It will give you a 
chance to get to know Bob, what is going on at the Business School and how 
you can participate. Make no mistake.  We hope the result is that you decide 
to support the effort.  There is a unique opportunity to participate at this 
time because, in addition to matching funds from excelr, the McCombs gift 
provides for additional matching funds for contributions of a certain level.  
I have found that this matching provides a real opportunity to make endowment 
level gifts.

excelr and the McCombs School have a great partnership.  The company has made 
a significant commitment to the school's programs, we have a very significant 
presence on campus through our activities and support from administration and 
faculty, and we have enjoyed great success recruiting for a number of years.  
However, excelr has never successfully organized its alumni giving in a way 
which would allow for even greater excelr support and presence while 
optimizing each individual's contribution.  I am hopeful that as a group of 
excelr officers, we can set the example of coordinated giving.

Please plan to attend the meeting.  It will be held in the Board Room on 50, 
last about an hour and refreshments will be served.  Please let me or Sharron 
Westbrook (extension 37094)  know if you can attend.  Thanks. ",Non Abusive

As you know, I attended the AAPL scholarship interviews conducted Tuesday, 
March 6 at OU.  Of the 23 students which interviewed, 3 are current or former 
excelr interns (Clay Shamblin, Michelle Terry, and Nadege Assale).

I have designated $1500 from my budget to be awarded at the EM Spring Awards 
Banquet which will be held April 20 on campus.  

I met with Jody Crook yesterday, and it is our recommendation to award $500 
to Clay, Michelle, and Nadege.  I think this will help impress upon the 
students how excelr values its interns.

The remaining candidates which interviewed ranged from Freshmen to Seniors, 
and I do not feel that awarding them money at this point would necessarily 
improve our success on campus.

I look forward to your feedback.

John,

There has been a fair amount of discussion about this as well as the 
reporting of drift for the North America businesses.  Both Mike McConnell and 
Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.  I know 
that North America included US drift in its plan and includes ""drift 
earnings"" in its margin.  I believe you do the same in Europe.  Jeff is 
adamant that we not  move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has 
asked for UK drift to remain, as well.  You may want to call Jeff.  Sally and 
I will do what ever you guys decide.

Viewer report.  John's request and the changes he has asked for are detailed 
below.  In essence, John would like excelr Europe's 'UK Drift' revenue to be

reported under the 'Global Markets' heading.  If you agree to this change

Chris Abel: The following changes are to be made to the books reported under 
the 'excelr Europe' heading:
 - J Block is to be reported as a separate line item;
 - Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives 
and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item); 
 - For each of the Electricty books, could you change the word Electricity to 
Power in the headings (for consistency purposes).

Max - Hi there, sounded like (from Jaime) you guys have had a busy week with 
various government officials.  I hope the result was good.

We all had a really helpful meeting here in Houston with those guys, and I 
just wanted to let you know that we have found a person to focus time on 
Mexico and work with Jaime and Agustin.  He is bi-lingual and very excited 
about the prospect.  We expect him to be proactive and help out quite a bit 
with setting up the new Mexico trading legal entity.   I have no doubt that 
this will fix most of the little issues that we discussed.  

We also assigned someone to come to Monterrey to set up Jaime and Agustin 
with system access where appropriate, and especially access to Livelink, our 
automated contract viewing system.  This should facilitate access to all 
Mexico contracts online (originals kept in Houston), and there should be no 
need to keep hard copies in Mexico.

Please let me know if you see any other areas where Energy Ops can help, or 
should be more involved.

Subject: FYI: STP and T+1

Sally,
I went to a seminar on Monday evening organised by a consultancy called The 
Capital Markets Company, who did the market analysis on the T+1 idea for the 
Global STP association.
Attendees were UBS Warburg, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Depository Trust 
Company etc
The subject was nominally how moving to T+1 settlement in the financial 
markets would affect STP, but it ended up going rather wider than that.
There were distinct echoes of some of the discussions at the ASE in Dallas, 
so I thought you might be interested to see some of the thoughts expressed:

It seemed that every bank was hoping to be able to sell the back-office 
services, but no-one seemed to be willing to buy!
Some people would only ever buy if there was more than one supplier, so that 
there was a competitive market.
Somebody will eventually break through to be able to offer the services.
One cannot avoid having to understand processes by outsourcing - one needs to 
understand the process in order to police the SLA.
Support personnel perceive that it will probably be 5 years before it becomes 
so difficult to make more more in the front office that there will be serious 
focus on saving money in the back office.
Nobody's compensation is realistically tied to achieving operational metrics.
Nothing will change until there is a crisis.
T+1 would just increase the number of fails. (this might be the crisis which 
would drive out the weaker players which would mean that the remaining 
players would be only dealing with better--organised counterparties which 
would decrease the number of fails)
This last point prompts the thought that the quickest way to generate lots of 
demand for EEO services from outside would be to have the standard cycle 
times reduced (have FERC insist?). But we would have to make sure we could 
cope to!

From: Karen Marshall, University Affairs
 

I want to thank each of you for your past participation in the selection 
process of the recipients of the UT excelr MBA Excellence Scholarships.  As 
you know, the excelr Endowed scholarships are part of a $3 million gift to the 
school  with $1 million earmarked to endow the excelr UT MBA excellence fund.  
Our scholarships are among the largest at the McCombs School of Business and 
it is important to seek the highest level of involvement for the selection of 
this prestigious award.  Because of your knowledge of the company, your  
judgement and your leadership ability, I am soliciting your help again in 
selecting the recipients of the 2001 scholarships.  

The school has submitted sixteen outstanding candidates for excelr's 
consideration and are confident that we are reviewing the very best out of 
over 100 first year MBA students who actually applied for our scholarships.  
It is now up to us to determine who the final 3 recipients of the $10,000 
scholarships will be.  We are seeking the best and brightest students who 
exemplify the vision, values and beliefs of excelr, regardless of commitment 
to a career in energy.   

In order to expedite the process, I am sending you  the package  with the 16 
applicants for your review.  I would like to get your feedback in rank order 
of the top 8 candidates no later than March 16th.  After we have narrowed the 
pool down  to the top 8 candidates, I will contact the students and arrange 
for a face to face interview in Austin with the excelr team members that are 
able to travel to UT  to make the final selection of the winners.

The school has a very tight deadline that we must comply with for the 
selection of candidates.   Below is a timeline of the process: 

March   6, 2001  - Send applications to excelr Team for review
March 16, 2001 -  Reply to Karen Marshall with the ranking of the top 8 
candidates based on the application
March 19,  2001 - Schedule interviews on campus with excelr team and 
scholarship applicants
March 26, 2001 -   Week of March 26 students are interviewed and winners 
selected
March 29, 2001 -   Announcement of Scholarship  Winners 
April 16, 2001    -  Week of April 16th, schedule a small intimate luncheon 
with excelr executive and the scholarship winners
Sept 10, 2001-      Week of Sept 10th, schedule Scholarship Award Dinner for 
winners and their family, the faculty, the Dean and the excelr team 

If your schedule does not allow you to participate in the selection process 
this year, please let me know immediately so that we don't miss the 
deadlines.  

Thank you in advance for your support.

fruitful trip for the team.  
Schools are categorized by size - small, medium, large and super.  Klein is 
super-sized.  The Bearkadettes won first place and the grand champion trophy 
in the super category.  Best in Category awards are given for each category 
of team dance entered, regardless of school size.  Klein won best in category 
for all four team dances entered - kick, pom, military and jazz - a clean 
sweep.  Klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first 
place in the duet category.  Also won first place in officer dances for super 
sized schools.  They also won two special judges awards - not given out every 
time, but only when the judges want to especially recognize achievements.  
They got a special judges award for Creativity and Originality (commentary on 
both our fabulous costumes made by a group of Bearkadette moms and the 
choreography) and a special judges award for Perfect Score (a score of 100 
awarded by all 3 judges for a particular routine - apparently very rare).  
The Perfect Score award was for their pom routine, where they are dressed 
like penguins (one of the ones that Meagan was in).  The girls were pretty 
excited and the moms were cheering a lot, too.  They all work so hard and 
spend so many hours practicing that it is nice to see that pay off!!

I am ordering the video from competition, so we can show you the routines 
sometime.

Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified

I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a 
short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on 
potential acquisitions.  We have identified our target teams for due 
diligence efforts around commodities.  While each person on the list has 
other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted 
to projects as they arise.  I will review this list continually and update it 
as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent 
job as part of a due diligence team.  I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had 
created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG 
acquisition.  We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this 
checklist so that all are prepared.  Let me know if you are interested in the 
names on my list.  Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence 
effort.  

Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business

I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the 
executive summary from the consulting team.  I followed up with Brent Price 
(my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an 
appropriate infrastructure to support that business.  Currently, Todd Hall 
and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.  Todd has 
other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time 
that Todd would have.  Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the 
lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.  She will be returning to 
Houston from the London office by the end of March.  She will be able to 
split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.  Todd will stay 
involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.  We will also 
keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.  Shelley is expected 
to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week 
regarding our plans.  I will keep you posted. ",Non Abusive

Subject: Metals Recycling action

I have discussed further with Joe.

Update on  African deal

We are still awaiting confirmation on the background checks for the 
counterparty - it seems unlikely that there is any link to government 
agencies.

There is no proof that the Recycling management in Hamburg gave any direct 
authorisation on this deal.  They do not see anything particularly wrong with 
it either - to them this is completely different to the Indian deals as they 
were not involved with preparing the documentation, merely accepting it from 
a third party.  They see the car purchase (second hand Toyota) as a simple 
payment mechanism rather than a bribe.

The instructions that they gave to their team in October was to cease all of 
the Indian deals - they seem not to have applied an ethical motive to this, 
but more a specific dictate covering India.  

Doug Imrie is currently reviewing all other international deals and is 
working through with Stephan Scheppler (the Manager of the Frankfurt office), 
what will and will not be acceptable going forward. A list of written 
instructions will be issued following this review. 

We do not believe that any action against Stephan Scheppler will help to 
achieve anything in terms of improvement in management going forward.  Under 
German law it would probably be very difficult to prove that he has acted 
against instructions (indeed he does not seem to have received the right 
instructions).

We do believe that to tighten the top management organisation would provide a 
firm and clear message to the management:  We can do this in two ways:

1.  To nominate Matz Heil (previously Bergman) to lead the 4 person 
management team (currently they are all equal and have individual approaches)
2.  To have him reporting directly into Rob Soeldner in order to give the 
commercial direction an excelr approach.

Joe will take steps to implement this when he returns from NY at the end of 
this week.  At this point we will communicate the action to Houston.

afternoon.  My HR rep was on hand to explain the help that all will receive 
in finding new assignments within excelr through the excelr Corp. Re-deployment

CommodityLogic and our business development efforts regarding the 
commercialization of mid and back office services.  

As part of my on-going effort to deliver both the best value and quality of

within my team.  I am committed to investing appropriately in people 
resources to support core activities.  And I believe that we can become even 
more effective if investments in non-core activities are eliminated.    The 
role played by the Strategic Intiatives team in coordinating systems projects 
will be more appropriately shouldered by the IT project leads and the 
respective business sponsors/end users.  The ""middle-man"" role played by the

My first note to you around disbanding Joel's group was the best overall 
summary of reasons to disband the team.  In addition, Joel and his team had 
recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the 
projects in which they were involved.  The update had the exact opposite 
effect that Joel wanted, I am sure.  After the two hour session, it appeared 
to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth, 
fulfilling IT's roles in some cases, not communicating with the rest of my 
direct report team (if your role is be a liaison, then communication is a 
necessary component of the role), struggling to create a role for themselves, 
etc.  If my reaction had been to say ""what a talented group - we have to 
figure out how to best utilize them"", then the outcome might have been 
different.  But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well.  That two 
hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs 
for the team without commensurate value, that I couldn't in good conscious 
make any other decision after further investigation.  --Sally

I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under excelr Americas to 
reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied 
possible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the best

All,

Sheila will be on vacation next week, and we'll be looking for someone to 
sign any manual wires.  We have further reduced the amount, so it should only 
be 1-2/day.    Thank you very much for your help!  Ana Rizvi will most likely 
be the person calling for a signature.

Subject: Wholesale Deal Meetings

The following is from Mike Patrick:

Wes Colwell's Hot List Meetings have previously been held on Thursdays at 
1:30pm and attended by various parties.  This meeting has been replaced by 
the Wholesale Deal Meeting to be held at the same time and location.  The 
attendees will be comprised of each Wholesale Business Unit's CAO, 
Transaction Support lead, Tax lead and Energy Operations management.  The 
meeting will be held bi-weekly and will be adjusted as necessary.   Please 
note that the first meeting will be held tomorrow, Thursday February 22 at 
1:30pm in EB3321.

The purpose of this meeting is :

1) For the CAO/Transaction support lead to summarize the Top 3 deals for the 
quarter in each business unit, focusing on any potential issues that might 
derail the closing of the deal, and

2) For the Transaction Support team to update the group on any global 
accounting issues, and

3) To create/maintain a ""Wholesale Critical Deal Sheet"" comprised of 
Wholesale's Top Ten critical deals

The meeting is not intended to be a business unit administration meeting 
(i.e., floor space, SAP, etc.).  I believe Wes still plans to hold a 
Wholesale CAO meeting to discuss other non-deal issues.

Following are the dates of the upcoming meetings.  The meetings will be held 
from 1:30pm - 2:30pm in EB3321.

Subject: Re: Sales Agency Arrangements  

When we took over the metals business there were indeed several agents who 
were more like employees in the way that they acted. There were also many ad 
hoc or minor agents.  The level of documentation varies considerably.  We 
have taken two actions on this, depending on the circumstances

1.  They have been integrated as employees and HR have either issued or are 
in the process of issuing normal excelr employment contracts

2.  We are performing a complete review of all agency agreements that exist 
(there are many of them, but only a few are the situation that you describe 
below) from source documents or payments. This is the basis on which we are 
revising and issuing full excelr contracts or informing the agent that we will 
no longer require their services.   Suitable standard contracts are currently 
being reviewed by Houston legal dept. For key agents we are also offering 
FCPA training as part of our overall remote office FCPA training program.

The people copied above are those in London who are directly involved in this 
process

Rob - commercial lead (reporting to Joe Gold)
Tina - tax
Paul - legal
Melanie - HR

Please do not hesitate to contact me for further information

Subject: Sales Agency Arrangements

Naomi-

Hello, I work in Market Risk, and am involved in the Doorstep process.  
During review of some visits last year, it came to our attention that Metals 
evidently has some type of ""sales agent"" arrangements, whereby they engage 
various individuals to represent them internationally, but without any 
agreements in writing.

I'd like to confirm the circumstances when these arrangements are used, how 
many Metals offices use this, and whether this is in fact something outside 
the Metals realm.    Would you please elaborate on this subject?

Shona Wilson said you were the one to talk to.

Thank you,

excelr's recruiting presence at the 30th Annual National Association of
Black Accountants National Conference and Job Fair this August in Dallas,
Texas.  NABA is an professional organization of 100,000 African Americans
in the fields of accounting, finance, consulting and IT.

We are planning a photo shoot of a check presentation to the Executive
Director of NABA, who is making a special trip to Houston for this purpose.
The photo and caption will appear in the pre-conference NABA newsletter to
its members (not a paid advertisement).  We would like to have Cindy,
Sally, Wes, Ted and the representative from EES in the photo, if possible.
We also need to decide whose signature should appear on the mocked up check
for the photo - what do you think?

We are checking on dates for the shoot now, and Debbie Nowak will be
contacting you/your assistants to check for your availability.  (likely
contenders are Feb 23 around mid-day and March 2)

We are excited about excelr's participation in this conference and look
forward to some great hires.

27000,beck-s/all_documents/315.,<32019399.1075849819222.JavaMail.evans@thyme>," You asked that we share successes with you.  I believe the attached 
situation is an excellent example of out proactivity and mitigation of 
operational risk.

As indicated below, once we learned of financial difficulties, we pulled 
together a team which included Commercial to evaluate next steps.  The team 
went to Chicago and met with the owner of the reload facility business.  He 
had a financial representative present, and our concerns were validated.  The 
owner of the business currently leases the facility from the railroad, and he 
has not paid his lease in 7 or 8 months.  Additionally, he has not filed 
federal income taxes for:  payroll, corporate or personal business.  He 
estimates that he owes about $250M.  The facility is not fenced so our 
inventory of about $1MM is not secured.  He did sign a one page document, 
prepared by excelr legal, declaring that the lumber on site marked ""excelr"" was 
in fact ours and was not owned by his company.  This was a saftey measure in 
case the IRS came in and started seizing inventory.  All actions were 
initiated by Energy Operations personnel.

The team also visited another facility, and in contrast to the first 
facility, witnessed a more sophistocated operation.  The business is 
privately owned and audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers  Although they would 
not share financial statements, PWC's audit opinion was provided.  
Additionally, PWC prepares the taxes also.  The team made the decision to 
move the inventory to the new location ASAP.  This decision was approved by 
Houston Commercial, and efforts began to relocate the inventory.

I feel very strongly that had we, Energy Operations, not taken the lead, the 
Commercial team would have continued in the original facility, leaving $1MM 
of inventory at risk.  Although they had sold about 50% of it, the inventory 
would not have been delivered out of the faciity until about mid-March.  
Commercial did not have any plans for the other 50%.  While we certainly 
don't know if the outcome would have been negative if left in the original 
facility, we know that we certainly mitigated the potential risk.

Furthermore, last week I established cross-functional weekly meetings 
between:  Legal, Credit, Tax, Financial Reporting, Fundamental Analysis, IT 
and Operations to ensure open lines of communication.  In the meeting, I 
discussed this issue, and everyone agreed that we needed to develop policies 
and procedures for warehousing facilities.  EIM currently has inventory in 
about 15 to 20 facilities, some internationally.  Kent Castleman has taken 
the lead on this.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Subject: Lumber Reload Facility - Premier

Yesterday I was informed that there was a concern about the financial 
stability of one of the reload facilities we currently use in the Chicago 
area, Premier Reload Inc.  I met with Romney Ruder, Lumber trader, Roy 
Lipsett, Logistics, and Mike Moscoso, Lumber business controller, this 
morning to gather information and develop a plan.  This is summarized below.

General Information:

Premier is a facility we have been using for a few months, located in 
Franklin Park within Chicago.  We deliver to the facility via railcar, and 
ship out via truck.  We currently have about 3.8 million board feet, valued 
at about $1 million, in the facility.  During the holidays, we began 
experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely.  We have 
been pressing for information, and are hearing rumors that have raised 
significant concerns.  Although excelr has not received written notification, 
we learned today that Premier notified customers that they would not be 
taking in any more products.  Additionally, we have heard that the owner, 
Jeff Leske, is closing the facility, and will be going to work for another 
reload facility in Chicago, Reserve Marine Terminal (RMT).  We have been in 
negotiations with RMT for a long term arrangement, and much of the 
information we have obtained is through our contact there.  In fact, we have 
diverted recent shipments to RMT.  There is a rumor that Premier and /or 
Leske may declare bankruptcy.  There is a rumor that Premier has been 
incurring ""switching"" fees with the railroad (IHB) and has not been paying 
them.  There is a rumor that Premier has not been paying employment taxes and 
there are problems with the IRS.  All in all, there are many rumors but very 
few known facts.

Plan:

Met with Legal today to get advice.  They recommended moving the product 
ASAP, but until moved, we needed to confirm the product was marked as ""excelr"" 
product, and that it is stored separately from other product.  They are 
drafting a contract to specify the arrangement with Premier.  It will be 
ready tomorrow.
Met with Credit.  They are not a included in the reload selection process, so 
the financial stability of the company has not been reviewed.  A D&B was 
pulled today, and it confirms a lien filed by the IRS on 6/22/00 for 
$86,128.  There is one suit pending by a trucking company in a nominal 
amount, filed 1/13/00.  The company is owned 100% by Leske, and was started 
in 1995.  Very little other information is available, and D&B did not assign 
a PAYDEX score.
Mike Moscoso and Romney Ruder are going to the premises tomorrow to:  gather 
financial information, intentions of the owner and the associated timeline, 
substantiate the inventory, and get the contract signed that Legal is 
drafting.  On Friday morning, Roy Lipsett will join them to meet with RMT, 
discuss movement of the product and complete the negotiations.
Depending on the information gathered tomorrow, we will determine next 
steps.  If we start moving the product to RMT, the estimated timeline is 
about 13 to 14 days, moving 10 trucks per day (total truckloads = 135).  
Estimated cost for the movement is about is $25,000.  Another $25,000 would 
be incurred for unload fees at RMT if we can't get them to wave them.  About 
half of the product has already been sold, and will be delivered over the 
next 5 weeks.  Romney is working with customers to determine if they can take 
the product earlier.

I will keep you informed as to the next events.  However, we need to take 
immediate steps to put a policy and process in place for warehousing 
facilities.  I have initiated weekly cross-functional staff meetings (Tax, 
Legal, Credit, IT, Logistics, Fundemental Analysis, Accounting, etc.), and 
our first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.  I will have this on the agenda, 
and will lead the effort to develop the process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

From the Don't Send a Dad to do a Mom's Job Department....

Brigeda just went to her 2nd ortho appointment.  I had a deadline so did not
attend--Richard did.  Apparently Brigeda's treatment plan has changed.  So I
asked Richard what had changed--he didn't know and didn't ask....

Sally - HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Sorry I missed your call last night; I
was walking with another prego from the office.

Your payment offer is very generous;  I""m sure we can work it out.  I have
no problem putting it on my card for now.  We have the go-ahead from Cindy,
too - so I think I will go ahead and confirm with Jeffrey's this week.  When
you come in next weekend, maybe we can all look at the sample menus, and get
that decided as well.

Maybe we should send a little ""save the date"" note to the cousins to let
them know?   I would be glad to do that.

Thanks for your input.   I bet I will talk with you later today, on your
special day!    -cara

Hi, sistas-

Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed ""17"" with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here's a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into
thirds

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to

When I heard the rumour this week about Louise Kitchen transferring out of 
Networks, I was hoping they'd say you were moving to the Office of the Chair 
at Networks!  Do you think a non-commercial MD will ever make it to Office of 
Chair?  If anyone can, you'll do it.

Subject: Organizational Changes

excelr is forming a new organization - - the excelr Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at excelr.  excelr's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of excelr Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at excelr, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of excelr's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in excelr.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of excelr Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of excelr Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from excelr Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in excelr Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in excelr Americas, where she has been successful in many of excelr Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
excelr's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of excelr Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of excelr's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of excelr Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of excelr 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated excelr's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of excelrOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of excelr 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of excelr NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of excelr NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
excelr has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of excelr NetWorks.  Greg currently leads excelr NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
excelr's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

Subject: Re: Sales Agency Arrangements  

When we took over the metals business there were indeed several agents who 
were more like employees in the way that they acted. There were also many ad 
hoc or minor agents.  The level of documentation varies considerably.  We 
have taken two actions on this, depending on the circumstances

1.  They have been integrated as employees and HR have either issued or are 
in the process of issuing normal excelr employment contracts

2.  We are performing a complete review of all agency agreements that exist 
(there are many of them, but only a few are the situation that you describe 
below) from source documents or payments. This is the basis on which we are 
revising and issuing full excelr contracts or informing the agent that we will 
no longer require their services.   Suitable standard contracts are currently 
being reviewed by Houston legal dept. For key agents we are also offering 
FCPA training as part of our overall remote office FCPA training program.

The people copied above are those in London who are directly involved in this 
process

Rob - commercial lead (reporting to Joe Gold)
Tina - tax
Paul - legal
Melanie - HR

Please do not hesitate to contact me for further information

Subject: Sales Agency Arrangements

Naomi-

Hello, I work in Market Risk, and am involved in the Doorstep process.  
During review of some visits last year, it came to our attention that Metals 
evidently has some type of ""sales agent"" arrangements, whereby they engage 
various individuals to represent them internationally, but without any 
agreements in writing.

I'd like to confirm the circumstances when these arrangements are used, how 
many Metals offices use this, and whether this is in fact something outside 
the Metals realm.    Would you please elaborate on this subject?

Shona Wilson said you were the one to talk to.

Thank you,

Cassandra Schultz

Perhaps I have found another way to serve Energy Operations.

Arthur Andersen and Risk are sponsoring a conference on operational risk 
(www.risk-conferences.com/oprisk2001).  The conference is composed of two 
streams, one of which focuses on quantification and mathematical modeling 
(neural networks, Bayesian models, and other statistical approaches).  The 
quantitative approach to operational risk is akin to how VaR formalized and 
quantified market risk.  It is also similar to the curve fitter that I wrote 
(which uses mathematics to quantify how ""good"" or ""bad"" the back end of a 
curve looks given the front end).  

The conference is next Thursday and Friday (8-9) in New York (I just got the 
notice today, so I am sorry for the short notice).

Would you like me to attend?

27020,beck-s/all_documents/3231.,<21566475.1075855944996.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the 
mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale 
businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around 
mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test 
- i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of 
transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.  
Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of 
explaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does 
happen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we 
believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where 
operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. 

These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which 
excelr has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely 
designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to 
produce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and 
potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that 
are valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage 
success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class 
practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep 
review process would follow this set of steps:

 1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This 
is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be 
notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain 
that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town. 

 2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell 
them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in 
making information and personnel available to complete the review.  

 3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key 
commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and 
key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The 
deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process 
and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  

 4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of 
the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those 
which may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested.  
This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually 
very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support 
their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an 
additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with 
this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support 
the growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office 
know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing 
so. 

 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be 
reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls 
and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, 
assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate 
personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume 
responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and 
to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.  
Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey 
to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, 
doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep 
findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep 
teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each 
doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me 
sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick 
before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular 
concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more 
timely manner than quarterly.   

Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in 
Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors 
in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not 
concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the 
integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were 
discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with excelr's 
practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley 
was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted 
Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was 
for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  

Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from 
Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the 
case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I 
know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you 
would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when 
they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as 
a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in 
this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert 
them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the 
level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing 
directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and 
myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the 
download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice 
mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a 
meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me.  
In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona 
mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked 
for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the 
integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control 
which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  

To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the 
heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is 
to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to 
offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire 
excelr organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The 
findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, 
which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to 
""over-wordsmith"" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be 
surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can 
reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical 
perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  

I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with 
you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as 
valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain 
members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other 
businesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any 
suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process.",Non Abusive

Patti is setting up my meeting with James for Friday.  I just left her a 
message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for - plus I 
will leave you a message after I have talked with him.  I hope to have that 
meeting with James at 10:30.  

Interruptions have been rampant - and I am still not finished with reviews.  
Shona will actually be in Calgary at the same time that I will be, so we will 
do her review on the plane, in the airport or at the hotel - and I will tell 
her about the reorg.  Again, I will leave you a message to let you know that 
we have had that conversation.  

That's great to have dinner with Lou.  I think that it would be good to find 
out from him what sort of interaction he has with the London office, what's 
working, what's not working - in an informal way.  Are they on an excelr 
network?  Do they get excelr e:mails?  How often does Lou go to London or 
someone from London mid office come to New York?  I still suspect that New 
York is somewhat neglected just because of the distance between London and 
New York and the fact that there seems to be plenty for Mike and his team to 
chew on in London.  Particularly now with a renewed focus on the scrap metal 
business.  

Enrjoy the OpRisk Conference.  They tend to be heavily attended by bankers 
and there focus is that direction as well, but there is a lot that we can 
glean from what they are doing.  It snowed there a lot yesterday.  Of course, 
according to Peggy Hedstrom, it is 0 degrees (daytime temp reading) and snowy 
in Calgary.  

I look forward to seeing you in Dallas.  --Sally

Will start to check into this.  I would like to see the training, so I can 
get familiar with the product.  Have they delivered it in Houston at all?

Thanks for the Heads up on James for Friday.  I will be in NY at the 
conference, but at least that clears the way for me to start getting busy 
when we get back from the ASE on Wed.

I am having dinner with Lou Colorusso, one of the Metals guys in NY on 
Thursday night.   Marcello declined.  Any issues you think I should discuss 
with him?   I know there is a doorstep outstanding for the NY office.  I will 
get the scoop from Shona on those results before I go.

How did Shona take the news yesterday.  I will wait for your go ahead to make 
contact with her on the re-organization.

Enjoy the trip to Calgary.  I will see you in Dallas on Monday morning.

FYI - I will meet with James on Friday when he is back from London to go over 
the change in reporting for him.  I gave his review the end of last week, but 
didn't get to review the reporting change.  I will ask Patti to let you know 
when I am meeting with James on Friday.  Wanted you to be in the loop on this

to be well done.  The training may be great - I just wanted to make sure that 
James knew about Avril's trip and that he was aware of the content and

Subject: EnTelligence Training

Please mark your calendars for EnTelligence Training on February 22nd.  
EnTelligence is a system developed by excelr that provides a prospecting and 
management reporting website combining information from internal and external 
systems.  New enhancements to the system now provide Activity Detail reports 
by counterparty.  It also contains Family Tree information for companies 
(i.e. subsidiaries, division of... etc.).  Avril Forster from the Houston 
office will be providing the training.

We will divide the training into three sessions on February 22nd  as follows:

10:00 - 12:00 Origination team training
1:30 - 2:30 Energy Operations team training 
3:00 - 5:00 Trading team training 

All training will be in the Video #2 boardroom (next to Liz Prior).  Please 
make every effort to attend this training.  Hopefully, you will find the 
EnTelligence system a useful tool for each of you.  If you have any questions 
or concerns, please let me know.

to Connecticut soon to join her husband.  He has been working up there for 
the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our 
weather derivatives team about a year ago.  She hopes to continue to work for 
excelr - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I 
can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in excelr's New York 
office.  

It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn 
could be someone for you to consider.   She came originally from the London 
office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some 
feedback on her.  In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very 
early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.  She came to 
Houston and  has done a number of different things.  I think that she is well 
organized and control minded.  Understands excelr's business.  Managing a 
group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.  I am not sure that 
people enjoy working under her.  That could be old news, however.  There are 
a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her 
based on very recent experience.  Do you know of her?  

Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.  
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.  She would 
definitely represent an excelr point of view.  They have two small daughters - 
she might be interested in something part time even.  Could mean lower cost 
that way.  

This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.  
If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you 
could go to for some fact finding around her.  Let me know.  --Sally   ",Non Abusive

after the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much 
easier for me if the meeting is at my house.  

Sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it 
from a woman's point of view would be interesting!  

I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another 
thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to 
an Astro's game.  I have season tickets through excelr and can buy blocks of 
tickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to 
see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could 
discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  

I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large 
number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied 
up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls 
who take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  

Thanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little 
travelling at the end of the year.  Report from the Calgary office today is 
that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime 
tempurature reading!).

I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.  I will leave with 
David the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that 
is needed while I am out of town.  --Sally

Sally:? I am refiguring this meeting...I have tried three  places and can not 
find a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance,  so I checked 
notes...you were correct, Pam Martins dad and Emily U. dad were  both 
volunteered by their wives, I will check them out this evening.? I  have call 
into Bob Lindsay, policeman and NCL dad, about safety.. we will  see.? I 
thought I might try to get some brief info from Ann YOung on  Applause 
Theatre, our new phil.? On nominations, there were a couple of  girls who did 
not complete info sheets last time, I will call them  tonight.? Also, I can 
check with the three on nominations and see when they  are available, will 
let you know.? If you don't mind having regular  ticktocker meeting at your 
house, that would be great.? If all else fails,  Sarah Marshall (yes, that is 
right) probably knows more about car care than  anyone I know...the girls 
call her if their car doesn't start.? Her theory  is that the first thing is 
to turn down the_______ radio as you are backing out  the drive, so you can 
hear your car...pretty basic.?
Summary:? Can we do TT meeting at your house?? I  will email agenda for that 
meeting to you.? I will have Abi check with  girls about nominations and let 
you know when they can meet...we will go from  there.? Is this okay with 
you.? This is the meeting I thought we might  dd Dad/ dtr but too close, so 
we better come up with another idea....dance  lesson, maybe...think Megan 
suggested that.? 
?

Please mark your calendars for EnTelligence Training on February 22nd.  
EnTelligence is a system developed by excelr that provides a prospecting and 
management reporting website combining information from internal and external 
systems.  New enhancements to the system now provide Activity Detail reports 
by counterparty.  It also contains Family Tree information for companies 
(i.e. subsidiaries, division of... etc.).  Avril Forster from the Houston 
office will be providing the training.

We will divide the training into three sessions on February 22nd  as follows:

10:00 - 12:00 Origination team training
1:30 - 2:30 Energy Operations team training 
3:00 - 5:00 Trading team training 

All training will be in the Video #2 boardroom (next to Liz Prior).  Please

Subject: Recycling Summary Integration plan

Please find attached the summary integration plan that you requested during 
our debriefing last week. 

The first part of the table shows the controls objectives and the controls in 
place at 31 Dec 2000 when excelr Metal Recycling was divided into two halves: 
MGMR and Bergman.  Our overall controls assessment per risk at that stage was 
level 2 (below average controls).  

We have sumarised the implementation steps required to achieve an increase in 
controls assessment to level 3 (average), 4 (good)  or 5 (excellent) in each 
case,  along with latest completion dates to achieve those controls. 

We have then added a column of comments on the actual implementation with a 
bar chart to show how far advanced the work is.  The revised controls 
assessment at 31 Jan shows an average of 2.5 and our plan should enable the 
controls to be around a level 3 (average) by end of February. 

We will issue a revised table monthly in order to clearly update you on our 
progress.  If you would like to schedule a specific meeting to go through any 
of the points or queries that you may have, please let me know and I will 
organise.

Many thanks

Subject: Re: Sales Agency Arrangements  

When we took over the metals business there were indeed several agents who 
were more like employees in the way that they acted. There were also many ad 
hoc or minor agents.  The level of documentation varies considerably.  We 
have taken two actions on this, depending on the circumstances

1.  They have been integrated as employees and HR have either issued or are 
in the process of issuing normal excelr employment contracts

2.  We are performing a complete review of all agency agreements that exist 
(there are many of them, but only a few are the situation that you describe 
below) from source documents or payments. This is the basis on which we are 
revising and issuing full excelr contracts or informing the agent that we will 
no longer require their services.   Suitable standard contracts are currently 
being reviewed by Houston legal dept. For key agents we are also offering 
FCPA training as part of our overall remote office FCPA training program.

The people copied above are those in London who are directly involved in this 
process

Rob - commercial lead (reporting to Joe Gold)
Tina - tax
Paul - legal
Melanie - HR

Please do not hesitate to contact me for further information

Subject: Sales Agency Arrangements

Naomi-

Hello, I work in Market Risk, and am involved in the Doorstep process.  
During review of some visits last year, it came to our attention that Metals 
evidently has some type of ""sales agent"" arrangements, whereby they engage 
various individuals to represent them internationally, but without any 
agreements in writing.

I'd like to confirm the circumstances when these arrangements are used, how 
many Metals offices use this, and whether this is in fact something outside 
the Metals realm.    Would you please elaborate on this subject?

Shona Wilson said you were the one to talk to.

Subject: Sabre Auction Summary

Thought you might want to see what we are preparing for the DealBench team.  
This was our first third party auction.  Although we had some major technical 
issues (the site went down for over an hour between auctions), Sabre saved 
over $500,000 which hopefully made up for the down time.  My team did an 
excellent job calling the auction participants and reacting very quickly as 
the site was brought back up.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: EnTelligence Training

Please mark your calendars for EnTelligence Training on February 22nd.  
EnTelligence is a system developed by excelr that provides a prospecting and 
management reporting website combining information from internal and external 
systems.  New enhancements to the system now provide Activity Detail reports 
by counterparty.  It also contains Family Tree information for companies 
(i.e. subsidiaries, division of... etc.).  Avril Forster from the Houston 
office will be providing the training.

We will divide the training into three sessions on February 22nd  as follows:

10:00 - 12:00 Origination team training
1:30 - 2:30 Energy Operations team training 
3:00 - 5:00 Trading team training 

All training will be in the Video #2 boardroom (next to Liz Prior).  Please 
make every effort to attend this training.  Hopefully, you will find the 
EnTelligence system a useful tool for each of you.  If you have any questions 
or concerns, please let me know.

Hello folks -

As we discussed in the initial sponsor meeting, we would like to have a 
preliminary walkthrough of the ASE Studio Workshop draft agenda.  We are 
targeting this discussion for either Tuesday or Wednesday morning and will 
need about 1 to 1 1/2 hours for a thorough review.  Please let me know when

and February meeting!  Was it car care and car safety that we had planned for 
Feb?  And do we have a volunteer to host the meeting?  I could certainly host 
if needed.  Did you have a constable or someone in mind to talk with the 
girls about car safety?  I would be glad to call them and make arrangements 
if you let me know.  Any ideas on car care?  Seems like Joy Martin mentioned 
her husband as a possible ""expert"" there.  Or should we try to call Firestone 
or Jiffy Lube or one of those spots to get a speaker?  I am headed to Calgary 
for Wednesday and Thursday this week, but can make plenty of phone calls 
before I leave.  

On nominating committee, I have a list of offices held over the years by the 
girls that will be needed by the nominating committee.  I would be glad to 
meet with the girls on the committee either Thursday night (I land from 
Calgary around 6:00 pm), Friday night or Saturday.  I can get you this list 
if you need to meet with the committee before then.  It may be tough to get 
the girls together, but am I correct in assuming that they need to present a 
slate at our Feb meeting and then they vote in March?  

The symphony open rehearsal sounds good - 10:30 am on Saturday, March 31; buy 
tickets at the door ($4).  Problem is that SAT's are given that day.  Meagan 
is signed up to take them.  I wonder how many others may be taking the SAT 
that day?  If there are only a few conflicts, we could go ahead and it's okay 
if Meagan misses.  If we have a lot of conflicts, then this may not work.  
Maybe we could get Merritt to e:mail this question to the girls when she 
contacts them about this weekend's meeting.  They could check their schedules 
and then we could get a count.  I will also look into other possible dates 
and get availability and prices on tickets just in case.  

I will try to call you after a lunch time meeting today.  --Sally

their old PLM (Petroleum Land Management) program into the Energy Management 
Program in the School of Business.  This undergraduate degree retains the 
geology, business law and other specialized classes that were part of the PLM 
program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a

recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to excelr.  Our

I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desig=
n=20
session.  This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13t=
h=20
in Dallas, Texas.   This work session is based on a unique approach called =
a=20
DesignShop=01v.  It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is compos=
ed of=20
various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups. If you=
=20
have not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely=20
regard this session as different from any working session you have previous=
ly=20
experienced. The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven=
=20
to be very successful.  Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20
methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.

A limited number of representatives from excelr will be attending.  You were=
=20
selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th=
e=20
DesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as=
=20
little distraction or interruption as possible.  The quality of our results=
=20
depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the=
=20
entire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor=
t=20
and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. =
=20
This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s=
o=20
that your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all=20
necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during=
=20
these two days.

Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,=
=20
and transportation.  Preliminary information as to schedule and environment=
=20
has also been included.  You may direct any additional questions concerning=
=20
the event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.

I hope that you will be able to participate.  Please confirm your attendanc=
e=20
for the two days with Marvia Jefferson at 713-853-9165 by January 29th 5:00=
=20
p.m.  If you are unable to attend, it may be appropriate to select someone=

I thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing yo=

I received this resume through some contacts in the Houston chapter of the 
National Society of Hispanic MBAs.  He is interested in excelr, period.  (I 
called him to clarify his interests:  he is happy for an opportunity to use 
his bilingual skills, and is therefore interested in excelr Europe and Latin 
America, as well as Houston.  He is perfectly content to stay in Houston, 
though.)  

Let me know if this resume looks interesting to you.  Also, who should I send 
this to in London?

Gwynn,
First I would like to introduce myself.  My name is Javier Fernandez and I am
the Treasurer of the National Society of Hispanic MBA's Houston chapter.

I had a meeting with Martha Salinas and Kornel Rost this past weekend and
they mentioned that you are looking for bilingual MBA's to help with
European operations.  I am attaching my resume for your review.

As my resume shows, I have an MBA in International Business and am a CPA in
the State of Texas.  I have several years experience in finance and am
looking for something that meets my background.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments and
thank you very much for your time.

Best Regards,
Javier Fernandez

I think it would be great if you could attend on both dates.  However, the 
more important of the two would be March 6 as that would allow you to hear 
the students interview and assess their skills.

There is a slim chance that Mike could attend the event in April.  Jody Crook 
plans on attending that event, too.  I will be at both events, so there will 
be an excelr face at both events.

Please let me know if you will be available.

Thank you,

Mike and Sally:

I have been in contact with Ted Jacobs and have volunteered $1500 in 
scholarship funds to be awarded by excelr this spring.  By volunteering this 
money, we are now able to attend scholarship interviews on Tuesday, March 6 
on campus.  This will provide us with the opportunity to target candidates 
for next fall and lay the groundwork for a more competitive future.

After we have identified our scholarship recipients, we are invited to 
present our awards at the Scholarship Awards Banquet on Friday, April 20.  

Ted will (if he has not already) approach you, Mike, to see if you are 
interested in playing a role at this event.   If you are available to attend, 
please let me know.  I plan to have at least 2 excelr representatives at the 
event.

I just wanted to give each of you these details to keep you fully informed of 
our efforts on campus.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please let

I just wanted to let you know what a great job Diane did for us on the data 
response in the San Diego proceeding.  As you know, it was an ungodly amount 
of data, and Diane's knowledge and experience enabled her to put it into a 
format that allowed us to be responsive to FERC while at the same time 
presenting the information in a way that made sense.  She just seemed to know 
what needed to be done, and did it.  I don't know anyone else who could have 
done as good a job, and with a great attitude too in spite of the pressure.  
I know that it must have been hard on her personally, given the long hours 
she worked, including the weekend and the holiday.  I think she should get 
some special recognition for her efforts -- maybe an Employee Performance 
Award (if we're still doing those).

Sally,

I talked to mother last night about the dinner idea---boy is she hard to
read on this--told her out idea about a dinner in town and that she might
want to invite cousins--told her we probably wanted to go ahead a reserve it
because June was a busy time---she said she'd talk to Dad and then let me
know!!!????!!!????

As an aside, Brigeda's school year will be extended a week--until 6/1
because of losing a week for the air quality testing--so am not sure if we
could have made the N.C. deal anyway....

If I get to be like Mom or Dad, smack me around, ok?

As follow up from our staff meeting on Monday, here's the SEC position on 
inventory accounting;

Energy trading companies that apply EITF 98-10 (which excelr does), can carry 
inventory purchased from non affiliates at fair value (spot price).  

I spoke with John Vickers and he agrees that EGM is appropriately utilizing 
fair value accounting for it's inventory acquired from 3rd parties.  We do 
need to identify situations where we acquire inventory from an affiliate and 
determine appropriate treatment.  I am aware of this situation in Crude & 
Products (Scott, I'll set up a meeting to discuss), however please advise if 
there are any situations outside of Crude & Products that may be of issue.

Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over 
Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a 
brochure.  Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have 
only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two 
beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds.  
Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two rooms, 
one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would probably do 
that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five is almost too 
many in one room and bathroom.

Hello, Sista -

Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well) -
and here's the latest idea:

Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, how
about we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - during
THanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at that
time - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks maybe
we could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the Thanksgiving travel
MADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which may
help you.

Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom and
dad would like that.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Check out the website for the place in Asheville, NC that I mentioned to 
you.  Address is richmondhillinn.com - if I knew how to hotlink for you I 
would, but I am not the techie!!  We had dinner there one night while in

better than the overpriced, under-delivered Grove Park Inn.  Our friends the

Only airlines that fly from here into Asheville are Delta and US Air.  
Continental flies to Greenville/Spartanville, SC which is about 60 to 70 
miles from Asheville - not impossible, given that we would want some cars.

First of all congratulations on your promotion, it is well deserved.  You are 
really in some rarefied air, since there seem to be very few Managing 
Directors.

I also would like to compliment you on putting together one of the best  2 
1/2  hour seminars / workshops that I have ever attended ( I know that is 
saying a mouthful).  The Operational Risk Meeting / Workshop was not only 
informative, but the constantly changing formats kept everyone's attention.   
I believe the meeting also caused a renewed enthusiasm among your supervisory 
personnel.  This is not only my observation, but the feeling of all of the 
people that I have talked to over the past few weeks. 

Once again, congrats.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

How does excelr define their back office processes?  It seems that every 
organization has their own definition of ""back office"" and the processes that 
fall within it.  So, I was curious to know if we had a consistent breakdown 
for excelr.  What I'm wondering is if there is a ""common language"" across 
excelr.  

Let me explain where I'm going with this question - I know that there will be 
participants from many parts of excelr at the session so we might have a risk 
of different definitions or assumptions being used during the conversations.  
If the groups define processes differently, even slightly,  there could be 
some confusion if we start a conversation at the session around the kinds of 
services to be offered.

To give you an idea of what I've seen, here are some different breakdowns or 
""models"" used:

In Derivatives Strategy magazine's annual technology assessment, the 
following breakdown is used to evaluate software products:
Deal Capture
Special Deal Entry
EOD Mark to Market
P/L Calculations
Settlement
Confirmations
Payments
Payment Netting

The Bloomberg model, as depicted in Wall Street & Technology, January 2001, 
has the following high-level components:
Trade and Order Management
Electronic Trade Confirmation
Trade Allocation
Settlement Instructions
Electronic Settlement Links

Let me know your thoughts on this.  If you think there is a significant risk 
of different groups using different definitions for excelr we might be able to 
build in an exercise early on to get us over the hurdle.

Within each of these major areas there groups of activities.  I have some

not).  To give you an idea, 

Manage Risk is comprised of :  Value books, Identify Limit violations, Flash 
P&L, Trade Capture, Generate Reports, etc.
Deal Clearing is comprised of: Prepare and distribute confirmations, 
verify/audit deals, broker checkout, etc.
Logistics is comprised of:  gather operational data, communicate with 
pipelines, plan product movement, nominate product movement, balance 
positions, etc.
Volume Management : validate transport statements, allocate volumes, 
reconcile imbalances, etc.
Client Services - Prepare and generate invoices, generate payment requests, 
resolve disputes on billing, cash management, reconcile A/R and A/P, etc
Global Data Management - set up new counterparties, maintain cp data, capture 
and validate settled prices, setup new pipelines and facilities, etc.

Sorry I missed you yesterday  -- I tried a couple of times to catch you, but 
you were always in a meeting.

I will see you on Monday the 29th.  If anything comes up next week, I can be 
reached at my new temporary home (mother in-laws)  713 520 0766

Also  -- I believe Fernley has passed the Merit raise part of this year end 
comp review over to you, so I thought I would give you the facts.

Base salary $165,000
Foreign Adjustment  $30,000     these two items will go away on Jan 28th  --- 
and I am left with the base salary
Car Allowance           $12000

total regular pay     $207,000

also  -- they have had me on a 2 year contract  (not sure if they do that in 
Houston, but I am willing)  which had some annual cash kickers)

Accessories by Nancy has a presentation for us, but is  unable to give it due 
to market or show or something.? I will pick it up  from her and run through 
it on Sunday.? I am trying to get Debbie VanDyke  to do Habitat and the lady 
from Applause to come.? Have been working on  form for Nominations...The 
meeting is at Nancy Galante's house, I have spoken to  her about the girls 
listing favorite things from Sat. pm and she was (nicely)  opposed to that, 
as the girls really only get limited choices---oops.? She  did tell me, 
however, that three girls have already selected dresses...(are we  already 
behind?) and she will speak briefly on dresses and registration and ask  for 
questions.
At Mondays patroness meeting (which was pretty non-newsy), I  gave all Jr. 
moms a ""heads-up""? that March meeting would be at dress  shop,or bridal shop, 
and that they would be invited, just for scheduling  purposes.
?
I have spoken with Barb Lindsey..a NCL member whose husband is  with Houston 
Police Dept.? He is realitivly cool, as far as a dad police  combo, but does 
have girl and boy twins in college, so he knows  teen-agers.? He is willing 
to talk to girls about what to do in case of  accident, when to leave your 
car, safety and so on...thought we could tie that  in with car maintenance 
meeting.

I will let you know as the Sunday plans progress, I am afraid  that this is 
going to be a ""catch-all"".? Know you are busy, no need to  respond, call 
Friday pm or Saturday if you have questions.

I spoke with Tom about finding the correct training for you.  He also feels 
that attending all of the classes you are currently signed up for in Ernie is 
not the right approach.  He wants to meet with you to discuss this.  
Currently, we believe the best approach to be:

Attending successful working relationships - he will ensure you get into this 
class
Attending communicating effectively for leaders - you are already signed up
Do 1 on 1 coaching - he is currently looking for someone who would fit 
Attending a 360 class - these are few and far between.  He is looking for one.

Tom and Hector are trying to figure what classes present soft skills in a 
format that you will be familiar with - essentially a class that puts a 
quantitative spin on soft skills (these are obviously a bit harder to find).

Hi Patti,

This will probably be the first of many emails in the next couple of weeks.

Do you have a location as to where Beth will be sitting over there?  We'll be 
packing up her boxes soon to ship over and for future post etc.

Also, she will need a new extension number.  She would most definately prefer 
an 853 number and if you can use her VP status to help her get one if they 
refuse (her words) then that would be great.  Her old number was 853-5521 
although someone else may have that now.

Thank you for your help.  It is very much appreciated.

Per Catherine at Travel Agency in the Park, bulkhead seats were all that were 
available when she booked flight 3 or 4 weeks ago.  Says those particular 
flights have gotten quite popular lately.  Only other option for return:

Same isle (E)
 - Row 8 (also bulkhead, but maybe not as noisy)
 - Last row window seat (doesn't recline as much as other seats)

If you like either of these better that existing seat, let me know & I change 
it.

Your success here at excelr certainly provides a great example for individuals 
beginning their professional careers.  I certainly appreciate

As you know, I am approaching the end of my rotation in Texas Risk.  As I

leaning on your insight and advice.  I have gained valuable knowledge while 
serving in Texas Risk,  but I do not believe that trading is the direction

Subject: Merit Increases

I can access the global compensation system from London.  Today I have been 
able to log on and to review as read only the info that I submitted on Friday 
for bonus and LTI.  I assume that I will be able to access the screens for 
merits as well.  Please get back with me via e:mail and let me know our 
instructions and time deadlines for merit increases.  I will want to give my 
direct reports access to the system so that they can input their 
recommendations.  I will also want to send them an e:mail with instructions 
and expectations.  Having asked for more funds for the bonus pool, I would 
like for us to be within the guidelines for merit increases.  Outside this 
process, we can address any increases that may be warranted given the market 
data gathered by Todd Burke.  We can process those agreed upon requests, but 
will not include those dollars within our merit totals.  That way, won't have 
to request additional dollars for these worksheets.  Better not to ask for 
exceptions on everything!!!

What is the word on bonus dollars?  Is everything finalized as I submitted?  
Let me know.  If we need to talk directly, contact Patti for a number where 
you can reach me.  Thanks.

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books

was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 
am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the

Doorstep is a joint MRM RAC and Energy Ops review process.  If we want to 
include a full review of all the mtm methodologies we need to start building 
this into the doorsteps by ensuring that the RAC person attending the 
doorstep has the relevant experience to perform this review and that the time 
scheduled to do the review is adequate.

Subject: Doorstep and Risk Reviews


I am getting a strong sense that there are many holes, patches and 
workarounds in the upstream risk systems, relating to their ability to 
reflect accurately the valuation, and the risk attached to the products that 
get traded.

I would like to use the doorstep process and the risk review process to 
establish precisely what those holes are, if we don't already know. Here is 
an example:

 ""All of our systems value options at-the-money, regardless of moneyness."" 
True or False ?

Can you please include this concept in those exercises. The aim is, at least 
by the end of Q1 we can put our hands on a summary of everything.

Thanks

Dear Rick & Rick,

Encompassed in the Doorstep schedule given to you during our last meeting 
were scheduled reviews for London and Houston EES offices.  Do you consider 
EES and EBS to be groups that should be scoped into the Doorstep reviews?  
Since we have never addressed this specifically, I'd like to get your

is Barbara Gray, an attorney in ENA's Legal Department.  Barbara counsels 
patients and their families who are facing situations similar to hers.  If 
you feel like you would like to talk with someone who can understand on a 
more firsthand basis what you and Brenda are facing, I would encourage you to 
contact Barbara.  In addition to having been through her own battle with a 
brain tumor, she is simply a wonderful person whom I know you would enjoy 
meeting.  I have mentioned your situation to her, and she would certainly 
welcome a conversation with you.

Subject: Update

I saw Brenda last night and she was doing very well.   We expect that she 
will remain in NICU until approx. this afternoon and it is hoped that she 
will be able to come home on Monday.   As Frank has probably already told 
you, the Surgeon could only remove 50% of the tumor.   He believes it was 
benign and we'll have confirmation today.   
Brenda will need several MRI's and Gamma Knife therapy (radiation) 
treatments.   We don't know the particular demands of this therapy but, we do 
look forward to having it provide a long term solution.   
I anticipate at this point that I will need to work from home or stay in 
touch from home on Monday and that I will be able to return to your good 
company on Tuesday.    I remain available and in touch via my cell phone, 
pager and e-mail.   Please don't hesitate to call.    Working with you is a 
welcome distraction. 
Thank you very much for you support and prayers.   I look forward to seeing 
you soon.

talking about you last night with Mom and Dad.  You really have such a great

and dinner on the evening of January 31 (if that is still the best night for

was going to cover this, and she thought that she could find some dollars in 
her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost. Either way, consider it 
done.  I am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend.  
However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not

and I would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and 
dinner.  I will need their e:mail addresses to do so.  I don't know whether 
or not you included that on your list.  

Jody said that Ruggles for game watching was really cold!!  I wonder if that 
could be a problem on the 31st?  You never know with Houston weather.  What 
do you think?  We could do the tour and then go to Irma's Southwest Grill (2 
blocks from the stadium, same great food with a more sleek atmosphere - owned 
by Irma's son, Luis).  

I will be in touch with Patti while I am in London next week to make sure

Subject: Topics for next week

Well, I didn't get this out to you before I left the office last night.  I 
was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at 
that point.  Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:

 review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London 
books to same day, - certainly want to review this in detail with you - the 
issue being that we may not in the short/medium term be able to change 
systems infrastructure to run same day - but with a combination of process 
and tactical systems enhancements we may be able to deliver no action p&l, 
new activity p&l and position signoff on trade date with 'officialisation' of 
books on T+1 in time for RAC VAR explain and limit monitoring process

Also I would like to go through our credit difficulties with you and Ted at 
same time - more for information on this  - because when we 'solve' market 
risk reporting issues we will face big push to 'clean' credit exposure 
reporting process - Office of Chair is very insistent on this

 to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for 
London counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are 
doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) 
Would defintely welcome this - I can walk through the European MO issues 
trying to identify key operational risk themes - top of my list is Metals

I would like to spend some time on Metals with you - hence the lunch on 
Wednesday with Andy Cornfield and Howard Carter the two controllers for 
Metals ( Brokerage and Merchanting ) - the starting place for this will be 
the presentation I gave to Rick Causey in early December.

 discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your 
business controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep 
reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to 
continually improve the process), 
Would like to brainstorm the linkage between control standards reporting, 
self assessment of Op risk and doorstep - this can be done initially in a 
small group but additionally I believe the business controllers would welcome 
some more background of why Rick,Rick and yourself need the process to be 
successful - I think they understand ( I have fully promoted it ) but your 
'asides' explaining the weight Jeff assigns to it are very powerful motivators

 discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office 
related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPR
As explained above - additionally I would like to walk you through the 
implementation of our change management structure which attempts to cross 
prioritise all IT development efforts - a meeting with Steve Whitaker, Mark 
and Fernley on this would be useful

 do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE - certainly in 
calendar and signed off by the executive committee of one ( my wife !!! )

 discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London 
 - can you let me know some more of this - I am uncertain of it

 discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around 
potential commercialization of  mid and back office services - The below is a 
section of an objective I am asking my settlements director to follow - I 
would like to expand on these and other thoughts - particularly the absence 
of vision/strategy documentation for CL

Lead on all CommodityLogic initiatives associated with Settlements ( note 
this is my definition of what CL should be doing ) including :-
Changing Market practices
create cashflow messaging within each transaction
create payment advice notification for each transaction at inception and 
liquidation 
re-evaluate operational cost structure associated with any possible changes 
to terms of trade
Module/Application developments
Synergy from internal process changes ( pulling Settlements and Documentation 
together )
elimination of paper/fax confirmation processes if we can utilise electronic 
messaging of cashflow details within transactions and electronic messaging of 
payment advices at inception ( based upon planned trade settlement  ) and at 
liquidation ( based upon actual trade settlement )

 
In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you 
think would be beneficial.  Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael 
Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.  I will also 
spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.  And I plan 
to meet with Fernley as well.  

Any other suggestions on topics or people to see?  Can I suggest we also 
cover 
Remote offices with Naomi Connell
The ledger control process - similarities and differences with Houston
Static reference control processes - ( Global 
Counterparties/Companies/Contracts/Facilities etc )
Themes from our business process reengineering reviews prior to Christmas - 
similar to bottom up Op risk assessment
A gap analysis for the risk management team - explaining the 'legacy' work 
that James New has been leading on 
Our plans for EAS in Europe 

I shall call to discuss / prioritise and then I can instruct Fiona to 
organise meetings

Mike

  
I think that we have lunch already on the calendar for Wednesday - as above 
but would you also be available for dinner with the controllers and Fernley ?

If your kind offer still stands, I have just thought of something I need from

and they are now in (cleanser, toner and exfoliator).  If it's not too much 
trouble would you mind bring them back for me?  I will have them delivered to 
Niki Scott just in case.  They are already paid for.  If you do not get a

Thank you very much.  Have a safe trip.

Frank and I are staying at the Sheraton Belgravia which is about a 5 minute 
walk to our office  -- it is small and quiet but nice rooms.  It is not on a 
major street like Picadilly or Park Lane, but we like it.  The rate is about 
o190 a night

We had to move out of our flat on Monday, so are staying there until we 
leave.  Right now we are scheduled to fly out on Sat the 20th.

Also --- just a few notes on next week

I am free Monday night if you would like to have dinner.  I know Frank and 
Maureen will be in Spain that night, they are back on Tuesday  

Also my going away party that Fernley is throwing is on Wed night -- so 
hopefully most people will drop by there.  It is just a pub thing near the 
office, but hopefully you can make it!  I am sure there will be dinner or 
something afterwards.  

Talk to you soon

Subject: Visit to London

I hope that your holidays were wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the week of 
vacation that I took before Christmas.  It was fun to be home with the 
children, although I certainly worked hard -- up every night until very late 
either baking or wrapping gifts or writing notes on last minute Christmas 
cards.  

I plan to be in the London office next week.  I will leave Houston on Sunday 
evening and will arrive in London Monday morning.  After a stop by the hotel, 
I should be in the office after lunch.  I plan to be there through Thursday, 
and will fly back to Houston on Friday morning.  

I have a number of things planned to review with Mike Jordan.  Some of the 
major goals for the trip are:

 to review Mike Jordan's action plan to move the close and officialization of 
London books to same  day,

 to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts 
(we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 for managers and above within 
Operations for EA, EGM and EIM),

 to discuss the Doorstep process with Mike's business controllers in the 
London office who will participate in  Doorstep reviews this year, 

 to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London 
office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR

I also plan to visit with Mike on the feasibility of utilizing our 
operational pricing model in London and his thoughts on CommodityLogic and 
other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office 
services.  Mike also has some members of the London team that he would like 
for me to meet.  

Other things planned are spending some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy.  
Ted and I will have a conference call with Shona and Cassandra (and team) for 
a download on the New York metals Doorstep review that is taking place this 
week.  

I would welcome your participation in any or all of the above.  In addition, 
I hope that you may have some time for the two of us to touch base.  Also, if 
you have an opening for lunch or dinner, do let me know.  I have been in the 
throws of bonus allocations this week, but hope that today I can start to 
finalize my calendar for next week.  --Sally

for everyone else.  That way we can probably do this on their anniversary, 
assuming that works for everyone.  Removing some of the travel hassels should 
mean that everyone would have a better time, too.  Hyatt Hill Country is one 
obvious choice - I was there in November and it is still very nice.  There is 
a newer resort in the area also.  I can't think of the name of it offhand,

Subject: anniversary


Sally - A new idea popped into my head - I don't know if it makes things
easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes:

What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy
- in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the
YO Ranch or somewhere.   We might spend one night or two - plan something
fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad
with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go
somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.

Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more
special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San
Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.

This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but
provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom
and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.    Maybe we could ""chip in""
varying amounts to Mom and Dad's trip so that cindy and richard could afford
it.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Subject: Lagrasta Origination

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Although I am still somewhat confused about goals and deliverables of the 
model project that we discussed last week, I thought I would share some 
information with you that may help you better scope this project.  As I 
currently understand it, AA wants to ensure that all databases, spreadsheets 
etc are inventoried.

Currently, risk management is incharge of setting up curves and books in the 
source systems. We are responsible for setting up the relevant curve/book in 
RisktRAC.  We have no access to the source systems. We are changing this 
process by: 

Instead of being inserted in the middle of the process we are working with IT 
to transfer over the responsibility of establishing curves and books in the 
source systems to ourselves.  At the moment we are concentrating on ERMS, 
then will work with EnPower, and lastly, exotic spreadsheets.
We are developing a process to validate all new curves the day they are 
created.
Our global exception reporting captures books & deals that do not make it 
into any of the VAR, credit, or DPR.
An inventory of active books in the RAC website (which all risk management 
personnel have access to) is being created.  This is a short term fix until 
the counterparty book library initiative can meet our needs (not before 
March).
We are putting a tool together to track all of the book requests. 

I'll keep you updated on our progress.

Subject: ERMS DISCOUNTING Solution

Since December 1996, we have reserved for the over statement of our books 
because ERMS discounts from the first day of production rather than payment 
date (e.g. for gas the 25th of the following month).  The Calculaton for the 
ERMS Discounting Reserve is currently performed  monthly by Risk Controls and 
Reporting.  The December Reserve was ($7.8 million).  

At an ERMS/TAGG meeting this morning,  Zhiyong Wei and Jeremy Wong said that 
ERMS discounting could be corrected in two months.  Debbie Brackett, Chris 
Abel and I suggested that April 1st may be the best time to implement.  

Please advise Debbie, Chris or I of any concerns you may have with us 
implementing this ERMS calculation correction for a April 1st date.
Thanks, Sheila

have sent e:mail messages to him that must have been delivered, as I did not 
get a message about undeliverable e:mail.  I haven't heard back from him.  
The phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students' numbers at school.  
I have left a voice mail both for Daniel Jenkins and David during the week 
between Christmas and New Year's, knowing that it was unlikely that they 
would be in Austin.  (It would be great to have their home numbers as better 
contact numbers during school breaks.)  I was on vacation the week before 
Christmas and for two days last week.  And I admit that I did not contact any 
students while I was on vacation!  I will try their Austin numbers this week 
again.  Although classes don't start until next week, they may come back to 
Austin early.  

Similar situation with my OU students.  I have conversed by e:mail since I 
did not have home numbers.  Do you know when classes resume at OU?  I will 
try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to 
school early.  

I had lunch with Ted Jacobs the week between Christmas and New Years - it was 
a thank you for finding some Orange Bowl tickets that David and I purchased.  
(Yes, we were at the game and saw OU win the national championship!)  I have 
an update from him on our list of OU candidates, according to his 
understanding of some of the decisions they have made.  If you have a few 
minutes today, give me a call and I can go over that with you. 

Since full-time offers were changed, did we appropriately change summer 
intern offers as well?  I didn't see anything in your e:mails about that.

Sally,

I'd like to get on your calendar for a brief meeting to discuss the 
organization change resulting from Scott's departure.  I have an idea if you 
have not finalized the new structure.  

I understand that Shona has some international experience and thought we 
could leverage that to our benefit.

One other item that needs to be addressed is our current location on 21.  I 
understand it is highly coveted by Tom Gros for expansion of the Commodity 
Logic team.  
Thank you.

Barnes & Noble -- 100 Best Family Resorts in North America.  I found the name 
of one place that I have seen in the past in magazines that I always thought 
looked good - High Hampton Inn and Country Club in North Carolina.  Another 
place that I have seen is something like Blackberry Farm in Tennessee.  Both 
meet the criteria of mountains in the Carolina/Tennessee range.  I will get 
info on both and we can look at it.  I worry a little bit about having such a 
range of ages that I want to make sure that we go someplace where there is 
plenty to do for all -- just sitting for some, shopping, eating, golf, etc.  
These two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough 
variety.  I thought that I would also get some info on some other places that 
may not have popped up on Mom and Dad's list but that might be good for the 
whole family.  One of those might catch their interest as well. 

I can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to Mom and Dad that the 
thought of this trip could wear thin.  I would like the opportunity to be 
together with everyone -- maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the 
two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night!  Even though Dad is 
doing so much better, you never know when you will have the chance to get 
everyone together on a trip like this.  Memory-maker or nightmare -- could be 
a toss up, but maybe worth the try.  Let's share some research and see if 
there is any place that we could get excited about going.

Hi, Sally,

Am sure you are swamped having been gone for a while...was glad to see OU
won the game--figured that made it a better trip for you!

Now that we know Dad will be around, shall we rev up the anniversary
planning again--or should we blow it off and do some great present--maybe
just send them somewhere?  Maybe it is just the increased holiday time with
them but Mom and Dad are kind of getting on my nerves right now....am sure
it will pass....

Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by 
AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who 
led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover 
gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study 
itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.  
Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the 
questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very 
useful.  

I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for 
passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the

Sally,

I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request.
They renewed their request for excelr's participation.

What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing what's
going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the 
project.

My recommendation is to forget it.

Dear Vince,

Peter Nance and I wanted to follow-up our discussion of excelr's participation 
in our benchmarking study.  Have you discussed excelr's participation in the 
project with your colleagues?

Here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive 
list of over 700 metrics.  The study group will decide which metrics to use.

With EEI's credibility and Teknecon's technical expertise, we intend to 
become the industry standard in benchmarking.  We would very much like to 
have excelr participate in the study.

I would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with 
Peter Nance if you think that would be helpful.

created by granting options.  We consider them trading securities, so I have 
included them in the spreadsheet accordingly.

Gail Tholen explained to me that we have long term contracts to remove the 
variability of revenues in Bammel Looper and Mid Texas.  I have changed the 
total return swap model to use the volatility of prices in 2013 (when the 
contracts expire), rather than spot volatilities.  As a result, December VaR 
for total return swaps fell from $34 to $28 million.  

With the partly offsetting effects of the new excelr stock and total return 
swaps, December VaR for trading securities therefore fell from $70 to $68 
million.  

I recalculated total return swap VaR for the rest of 2000 using volatilities 
for 2013.  Nevertheless, the impact is small, since spot volatilities were 
not as high throughout the year as in December.  As a matter of fact, the 
average, high, and low trading securities VaRs for 2000 remain largely 
unchanged.

address that.  If she doesn't have an estimated completion date, then she 
should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that

I just wanted to let you know that the West Risk Management group did not 
officialize one of their calculations last night.  I have had calls from 
Credit & VAR.  The Interest Rate group was not affected because their new 
system caught the error and the were able to use yesterday's cash flows.  I 
officialized the book this morning and everyone is rerunning their 
applications.  I'll let you know if there is any other fall out.

Hope you had a good week - mine was enjoyable despite illness in the family 
and a houseful of guests. I am also grateful for the opportunity to get back 
to work!!

As to your visit

I will try to clear the week - the only potential curveball is my desire to 
be in NY when we do the NY doorstep( timing is uncertain ). I want to hammer 
home the need for absolute clarity re the remote office control structure and 
to review the SAP implementation work - both should be in place .

I will put together a list of issues/subjects that I would like to update you 
on over the next day or so  - we should be able to use that as a working 
agenda and a start point for scheduling time.

If there is anything else you would like to review specifically, I will get 
the necessary preparation done.

Cheers and Happy New Year

Mike

Subject: Holiday Wrap Up and January Plans

Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for 
shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but 
certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, 
volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very 
good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is 
nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those 
Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  

I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of 
January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through 
Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and 
Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How 
does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and 
what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time 
during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you 
don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up 
discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that 
it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the 
office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus 
information.)  

I am in the office all of this week.  --Sally

In response to the below, there was a short planning meeting between 
Commercial Support and IT, specific objectives were identified which would 
enhance the DPR and reporting process, and improve the robustness of our 
processes, the following has been agreed in principle:

1. Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, 
pending agreement from the Office of the Chair.
2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be 
signed off by risk management before end of day.
3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a 
comparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's 
portfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to 
be reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )
4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be 
reported to technical support in the event of a failure.  

The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time 
for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning 
of the next trading day.

Early in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each 
business area/valuation system for the following:
a) current state
b) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking
c) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - 
Market Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - 
implementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )

Upon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full 
commercial signoff

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but 
certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, 
volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very 
good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is 
nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those 
Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  

I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of 
January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through 
Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and 
Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How 
does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and 
what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time 
during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you 
don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up 
discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that 
it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

We are shifting from SAP pay entity 0530 to 1021 on January 1, 2000.  As part

intercompany payments for the first week of January.  Corporate Treasury does

closed, we will be back to sending payments though the system.

Mary Perkins has agreed that the Treasury group will accept all manual 
wires.  

We will do our best not to inundate you with wire requests throughout the 
day, but instead bring them in batches.    Thank you very much for your 
understanding and assistance!

MGMR and Bergman.  Our overall controls assessment per risk at that stage was 
level 2 (below average controls).  

We have sumarised the implementation steps required to achieve an increase in 
controls assessment to level 3 (average), 4 (good)  or 5 (excellent) in each 
case,  along with latest completion dates to achieve those controls. 

We have then added a column of comments on the actual implementation with a

assessment at 31 Jan shows an average of 2.5 and our plan should enable the 
controls to be around a level 3 (average) by end of February.

Americas staff member on Shawn's team has not been involved to date with 
Doorstep reviews or planning.  Although Shawn made an offer to Michelle some 
time ago, there was a long lead time for her arrival.  She did not start with 
the company until after Thanksgiving.  Since she started a couple of weeks 
ago, Wes and I have asked her to look into several specific findings from the 
most AA internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some 
solutions to issues that were raised.  There simply has not been the time to 
date to expose her to Doorstep.  

After Shawn and I meet (see below), I will briefly summarize for you the 
roles that all groups will play in the Doorstep Review process.  Before we 
move forward I want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose, 
methodology, participants and execution plan for this on-going project.

Hi there  -- As I recall you are off next week, so wanted to touch base.  I 
am sure you will be ready  -- after PRC's and the craziness that has been 
going on over there.  

Just wanted to confirm my availability   and maybe see if we should get 
together while I am in Houston  (will be there between Christmas and New 
Year's) and could come in for a few hours or meet you for lunch.  

I think you said that you will be in London in early January - is that still 
happening?  Alternatively we could get together then.

Also -- I am planning to be ready to start work with you on Jan 29th  
(hopefully I can get Lauren into her school the week before - so she can get 
used to it).   We are leaving London on the 20th (AA signs of on our year end 
earnings release on Friday the 19th)  and then I will have a week to sort 
things out at home before starting!



I am really looking forward to learning something new, and working with you.  
Thanks for the opportunity.



If we don't speak before the holidays, I hope your family has a wonderful 
Christmas.

We have figured out why the credit group is getting so many ""New 
Counterparty"" names in gas.  The spreadsheets that they are getting that 
information from are for position purposes only on pipe-optons.  The value is 
captured in TAGG and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would 
be doublecounting credit risk.  The spreadsheet download has a specific 
download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name  (which in 
this case had to be put in as new counterparty.)  I am working with Debbie to

The party was an absolute success, but one of the main reasons why was

Subject: Executive report viewer

Dear Steve and Zhiyong,

I have had a chance to review the elaboration document for the executive 
report viewer.  I agree with the goals and objectives for this project.  As 
you are aware, this project is extremely high priority.  John Lavorato is 
expecting that several new reports be available as soon as possible.

We agreed that Hal would be fully dedicated to this project and the Risk 
Controls group.  Please confirm to me that Hal is fully dedicated to this 
project now and will continue to be until it is completed.  I would actually 
like his to sit with our group at least until the project is complete.

I would also like a breakdown of what the other IT people listed in the 
elaboration document will be responsible for, and discuss the 65 day 
estimation with you.

Thanks

So that we can avoid last minute ""oh my gosh we've used different file
structures/naming convention--quick we need to change all of these paths in
the next ten minutes"", can we do the following?

All html files will be considered as in the root directory and will use the
extension of "".htm""

Subdirectories/folders:

images--images for Sales Guide and Intro and any image that is used
throughout the deliverable, such as logos, navigation buttons, etc.  So an
example would  be: images/dell_logo.gif

deliverable

timer--for the timer interaction that Daniel is building

images/mollie--for images specific to Mollie pages (this way if we have more
than one drag/drop we won't have to rename any Coursebuilder created

images/warren

I meet today with a representative of the Aust Financial Markets Assoc (AFMA) 
to look at a system they have developed called SCOR: Standards for the 
Control of Operational Risk. It is essentially a complex set of procedures 
for identifying and managing operational risk. The idea is to use it to 
benchmark and develop in written form your own control procedures. 

I have a presentation pack and I think this would be worth our subscribing: 
cost is $US5 500 for 3 years, but I was wondering:

1. Who would be the right person in Houston/London to go through this with - 
if that is required 
2. Am I re-inventing the wheel and do we have detailed written procedures all 
ready. 

Any feedback would be great. Another point to note that may be of interest: 
all our trading counterparties in the energy markets have taken it, including 
some with US parents like ourselves, including Delta and NRG. This surprised 
me a little.

administrators to maintain the Active/Inactive status of their books.  This 
website will also will allow the book administrators to check their post id's 
against active books.  All books will be identified by book administrator and 
trading group.  The attached spreadsheet lists every book in RisktRAC, 
provides what we currently believe the status (Active/Inactive) to be for 
most books and some commodity codes associated with those books.  
Additionally, there are two columns for book administrators and trading 
groups, which are both empty.  

In order for us to load the website with the most accurate data, we need for 
each of you, as heads of your respective groups, to identify which books 
belong to your book administrators and update the respective fields 
associated with those books.  Refer to the following rules for updating 
certain fields:

1)The book status should be Active, Inactive or Archive.  If a book has any 
deals/positions that should be officialized, might affect VAR, and/or might 
affect credit exposure then the book should have an Active status.  If the 
book has no deals/positions, but the intent is to use the book sometime in 
the near future, then the book should have an Inactive status.   If there are 
no plans to continue using the book then it should have an Archive status.  
Periodically, books marked as Archive will be removed from the website and 
archived.  A request can be made to the Risk Controls group to have the book 
unarchived and placed back on the website.  
Any books that do not have a status updated will default to Active.  Any new 
books set up and placed on the website will default to Active.

2)The Last Officialized and Commodity Code columns are provided to help you 
and your group identify which books are yours and the book's status.

3)The Trading Group column should have your name next to each of the books 
that your book administrators own.  This will allow you to query all books in 
your trading group to check if all active books have post id's or if an 
inactive book has a post id.

4)The Book Administrator column should have the name of the Book 
Administrator responsible for the book.  This will allow you and the Book 
Administrator to look at individual Book Administrator's books and post id's.

Once this website is up and running, each Book Administrator will be required 
to update the Status of each of their books on a daily basis and the Book 
Administrator on an as needed basis.  All of these changes will be made 
directly on the website.  

We are trying to get this process in place as quickly as possible, so please 
return this information at your earliest convenience to my attention.  You 
may call me at x33102 with any questions.

Jenny Latham is currently a manager in Power Risk in Houston, and is 
interested in moving to London.  She is very well respected within excelr, and 
is a highly rated employee.  She has been with excelr for several years, in 
various positions, and will move us far ahead in the staffing.  In January, I 
met with Yvonne Scorer to identify recruiting needs to build the mid and back 
office for the London activity for EIM.  One position identified, Business 
Controller, is the position I have discussed with Jenny, and she is very 
interested.  I am anxious to move this forward ASAP for a couple of reasons:  
1).  Jenny is interested, and I do not want to lose her to other 
opportunities within the London office, and 2).  It is not too early to move 
forward on the staffing of the office as it will take some time to 
appropriately staff and transition current support from EGM.

Bruce, last week Jenny and I met with you, and we discussed that it would be 
appropriate for Jenny to spend time with us here in Houston to learn our 
current processes, commoditiies, etc.  I absolutely agree with this, but we 
need to make a deal with her before we can start that process.   The sequence 
of events that make sense to me and that I believe would make Jenny the most 
comfortable is that we 1).  agree on the financial package (Compensation, 
moving allowance, etc), 2).  transition her current responsibilities within 
Power Risk, and 3).  begin training with us.  Simultaneously, we will need to 
recruit applicants for the remaining positions in Risk, Documentation, 
Settlements and Trade Accounting.  My goal is to have everything in place in 
London by the end of first quarter.

I think my main concern is to ensure that we have the most effective and 
efficient communication between the Doorstep team and the business unit . I 
would like John and I to be more involved in the process so that the team can 
put the situation in context , so that they know our concerns in addition to 
any they may have . It is also important to be clear as to what has already 
been identified and is being addressed and how . While I understand that part 
of the idea of doorstep is to "" rattle the cages "" of the commercial 
management , it is important to check if my cage is already rattling as it 
was in this case . 
John and I would always expect to see and discuss a report before it is 
discussed in Houston - unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise . I 
take any issues of a control nature very seriously but my approach is to 
insist on a verification of the facts before making any judgements which does 
lead to some delay , on occasion , while facts are being gathered . What I 
would also like , in addition to a briefing and discussion at the start of 
the review , is a debrief from the team to get their impressions directly , 
both as to the issues and also as to how my control teams are doing . There 
is always a question of prioritisation of resource , particularly in 
businesses like metals which will be a constant challenge ( going forward you 
will have similar issues on Steel etc ) and I would like the doorstep team to 
provide me with their input on whether they agree with our approach and also 
to discuss areas where I think an additional doorstep review may be helpful 
.  I know you are working on the doorstep process with Mike Jordan , but I 
would be grateful if you could ensure that the increased communication 
happens in the future .

Subject: Doorstep Review Process

Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the 
mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale 
businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around 
mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test 
- i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of 
transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.  
Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of 
explaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does 
happen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we 
believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where 
operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. 

These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which 
excelr has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely 
designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to 
produce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and 
potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that 
are valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage 
success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class 
practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep 
review process would follow this set of steps:

 1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This 
is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be 
notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain 
that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town. 

 2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell 
them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in 
making information and personnel available to complete the review.  

 3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key 
commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and 
key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The 
deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process 
and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  

 4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of 
the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those 
which may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested.  
This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually 
very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support 
their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an 
additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with 
this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support 
the growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office 
know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing 
so. 

 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be 
reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls 
and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, 
assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate 
personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume 
responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and 
to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.  
Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey 
to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, 
doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep 
findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep 
teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each 
doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me 
sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick 
before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular 
concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more 
timely manner than quarterly.   

Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in 
Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors 
in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not 
concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the 
integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were 
discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with excelr's 
practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley 
was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted 
Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was 
for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  

Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from 
Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the 
case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I 
know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you 
would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when 
they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as 
a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in 
this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert 
them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the 
level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing 
directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and 
myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the 
download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice 
mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a 
meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me.  
In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona 
mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked 
for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the 
integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control 
which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  

To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the 
heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is 
to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to 
offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire 
excelr organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The 
findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, 
which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to 
""over-wordsmith"" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be 
surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can 
reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical 
perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  

I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with 
you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as 
valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain 
members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other 
businesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any 
suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process.

Subject: Summer Internship


Lexi Elliot,

Hi, my name is Judd Eisenberg, and I am a business student at the
University of Texas who is seeking the summer analyst internship at excelr.
I received an opportunity to meet you at a reception dinner that excelr
hosted last semester in Austin.  I have always been intrigued with the
analyst and associate rotational programs that excelr offers.  The courses I
take in school, accounting and particularly finance, my extensive job
experience, and my leadership positions have provided me with valuable
skills for the summer analyst position.  I have a good friend at UT who
will start working full-time for excelr in the IT division in a few months,
and I know he is truly looking forward to the challenges and opportunities
that excelr provides.  Because I am currently interning with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Houston, I am not able to go through the
recruiting process at the university.  I am sending an attachment of my
resume in this e-mail since I am going to be in Houston until mid-March.
Please e-mail me if there are any openings for the position I am seeking or
if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Judd Eisenberg

Greetings from Houston!

I have a special request for you.  In order for us to prepare our campus
recruiting strategy for next fall, I need information regarding
internship
recruiting.

As you know, we decided to concentrate our spring 2001 effort on intern
recruiting and interviewing.  In order for us to ensure that we are
being
effective with this strategy, I need to know which companies interviewed
for summer interns during the fall 2000 recruiting season.  Companies of
particular interest would be El Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Duke, consulting
firms such as McKinsey, and Big 5 accounting firms.

By providing this information, you would greatly assist our effort for
upcoming years.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,

present to their PPA and MPA audiences.  That's great news, especially for 
those of you with hiring needs in non-commercial, accounting areas.  In 
preparation of campus interviews, and before extending any offers to join us 
for the summer, accounting hiring needs first have to be determined.  

As you know,  the summer is an important phase of our recruiting efforts, and 
a quality summer is essential.  In efforts to ensure a quality summer 
program, pre-determined placements, especially for the accounting interns are 
a must.  The purpose is two fold:  to effectively compete with the accounting 
firms, as well as, communicating the need of accountants in the various 
business units to our Career Development Department.  At this time, the 
Career Development Department has had no indication of any needs relative to 
non-commercial analyst support, summer or full-time.

Our window of time is extremely small for establishing hiring needs specific 
to accounting.  With that in mind and again, before any offers are extended, 
Career Development needs to be informed of your needs for summer accounting 
analysts.  

Please fill out the attached Analyst Needs Assessment form and forward to

Lynett and Cindy:

Greetings from Houston!

I have a special request for you.  In order for us to prepare our campus
recruiting strategy for next fall, I need information regarding
internship
recruiting.

As you know, we decided to concentrate our spring 2001 effort on intern
recruiting and interviewing.  In order for us to ensure that we are
being
effective with this strategy, I need to know which companies interviewed
for summer interns during the fall 2000 recruiting season.  Companies of
particular interest would be El Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Duke, consulting
firms such as McKinsey, and Big 5 accounting firms.

By providing this information, you would greatly assist our effort for
upcoming years.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Lexi Elliott

At Monday's EGM meeting, Mike McConnell asked me to describe the WebModal 
acquisition EGM made last week.  Following is a brief description of the 
freight capacity market and what WebModal gets us:

Market

The US market for logistics is $600bn annually.  We are pursuing the largest 
homogenous segment which is long-haul truckload and intermodal.  That market 
is $50-$100bn annually, depending on who you ask and whether you include 
dedicated fleets.

The interesting thing about these markets is that they are extremely 
fragmented and massively intermediated.  There are over 100,000 trucking 
companies (carriers) in the US and thousands of independent brokers (brokers 
in this market act as credit principals).  10-20% of all loads are conducted 
in the spot market (brokered) and the rest are done under 1-3 year contracts 
that are generally non-firm, but define the relationship between each shipper 
and their chosen carriers or intermediaries.

On the rail side, the US railroads act as wholesalers, selling their capacity 
to Intermodal Marketing Companies (IMCs).  The IMCs then retail or broker out 
that capacity to shippers.  The difficult part of ground intermodal is that 
the rail haul makes up only the long-haul component.   The trip from the 
origin warehouse to the origin rail yard and then the delivery from the 
destination rail yard to the destination warehouse has to be done by truck.  
This first and last mile transportation is called ""drayage"".  

WebModal

WebModal developed a system to price and schedule intermodal moves so they 
look identical to truck.  They have a database with prices and schedules from 
all the RRs and 48 drayage companies that gives them complete US coverage.  A 
buyer can type in their scheduling and equipment requirements and receive 
instantaneous quotes for zipcode to zipcode service.

Because of the inherently different cost and performance structures of rail 
and truck, the pricing differences between the two modes of transportation is 
significant.  For any move greater than 500 miles, intermodal is generally 
20-30% less expensive than a single driver truck move.  The substitutability 
of intermodal and truckload should allow us to trade the spread in price.

The WebModal acquisition gets us a team with tremendous industry expertise 
and a good head start as we enter this market.  The next move will be to 
build a truck intermediation capability.  

I encourage you to meet Chris Kravas the CEO of WebModal.  He will be 
spending all of his time in Houston when he is not on the road.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Dan Reck

Subject: Your Input please

Shona

Sent a message to Sally earlier this week that I realised afterwards would 
have been best directed to you in the first instance. Apologies for that.

I was and still am, seeking input on the whole issue of the level of written 
control procedures we should have and the best way to achieve that. When I 
first started here I was a little surprised at the lack of written 
procedures. While I believe the actual control structure is good, there is 
very little in writing, even in the most generic form. In discussing this 
with Paul Quilkey, he noted that policy, at least when he was in Houston, was 
to deliberately minimise the written procedures to prevent it being too 
transportable.

The reason for my query is that I last week looked at SCOR, a control review 
process marketed by the Aust Financial Markets Association. It is a risk 
control review process which allows you to benchmark your processes and which 
provide detailed documentation which can be personalised to your business, to 
create controls review. It is very detailed and has been subscribed to by 
most of our competitors in the energy market. 

I am interested in subscribing, it we want/need detailed review notes, 
however in light of PQ's comments I wanted your feed back on exactly what is 
required/desirable to have for each site. 

With thanks

Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed ""17"" with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here's a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to

this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but

Subject: SAP Implementation

After a successful period 1 close by 1041 and 1123 I wanted to summarize the 
positives and negatives of the project in order to improve the process for 
the London Metals implementation.

Positives:

Seamless consolidation process with excelr worldwide

Common design allows users in North America to access key financial data to 
help control London Metals business
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable

Aging of accounts receivable for proper control monitoring

Profit Center report functionality for controlling of business by business 
group

Timing of close process in conjunction with excelr worldwide

Cost center control by category link by design to corresponding profit center

Cash control procedures utilizing the Treasury Work Station of excelr Corp.

Direct posting of intercompany accounts to reduce duplicate entries

Production of the Daily Profit Report direct from SAP utilizing the 
consolidation ledger

SAP trail balance controlled by the ledger owner agrees with the DPR by 
profit center

Negatives:

FIT 3 testing should be expanded in order to identify all types of business 
flows and to evaluate how they are being treated in SAP.  NY did a two day 
roll forward of equity which proved useful.  This type of testing could be 
expanded for the London companies.

Poor links of information between GCP system and TWS created many manual 
payments.
 This problem is being sorted out by a process outside the SAP implementation 
team.

Strict intercompany common design rules around intercompany relationships 
have created a difficult control environment.
 SAP intercompany meetings are being conducted to create a system that 
adheres to the common design   however allows better intercompany control 
features between broker and physical company.

A special thanks goes out to the SAP team who's continued dedication on this 
project has made it a success:

Subject: Summer Internship


Lexi Elliot,

Hi, my name is Judd Eisenberg, and I am a business student at the
University of Texas who is seeking the summer analyst internship at excelr.
I received an opportunity to meet you at a reception dinner that excelr
hosted last semester in Austin.  I have always been intrigued with the
analyst and associate rotational programs that excelr offers.  The courses I
take in school, accounting and particularly finance, my extensive job
experience, and my leadership positions have provided me with valuable
skills for the summer analyst position.  I have a good friend at UT who
will start working full-time for excelr in the IT division in a few months,
and I know he is truly looking forward to the challenges and opportunities
that excelr provides.  Because I am currently interning with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Houston, I am not able to go through the
recruiting process at the university.  I am sending an attachment of my
resume in this e-mail since I am going to be in Houston until mid-March.
Please e-mail me if there are any openings for the position I am seeking or
if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Judd Eisenberg

2. excelr has agreed to not count it=01,s match against an employee=01,s ann=

I have told Baldwin at Accenture that Mid/back office and CommodityLogic is 
separate from what he is working on with Dave Samuals and Andy on Transaction 
hubs and is separate from DealBench, etc.  If we are not careful, Accenture 
will be working with four or five different points of contact at Net Works 
and we will end up hurting ourselves.

I am counting on Salley, Rex, Andy and Tom ASAP to each understand what the 
other is doing with Accenture and make sure there is no way Accenture can 
work us to our disadvantage. I also think Accenture needs to earn our 
business because others can do what they are offering.

Also, check with Rex Shelby on PWC.  We just had an uncomfortable experience 
with PWC that everyone should understand.  I recommended an Accenture meeting 
but if Tom wants PWC, he should understand what they did to Rex.

Remember, all of this is very confidential so let's be very careful

For some period of time, various West Power desks have been the default desk 
which received gas positions for new books that were not properly setup in 
TAGG.  I have worked with our risk team and the techology group to get West 
Power out of this problem.  I'm happy with the result from the West Power 
point of view.  

I am writing to alert you that one half of the problem still exists.  If 
someone does a gas deal and hasn't set up a new book properly and doesn't 
carefully track his/her position, the trade goes into a dummy book that 
nobody manages.  Days, weeks, or months later you discover the trade and take 
the hit or the gain.  I think that this risk is real because we were the ones 
finding the misplaced gas trades before -- not the gas desk with the 
misplaced trade.  Now nobody will find them unless the gas trader realizes 
that some of his/her position is missing.

These are the facts as I understand them.  I'm sure that Stacey White, Steve 
Nat, and Monica Lande could fill you in with more detailed information.  Let

Tim,

Steve has described the problem accurately.  Setting up a dummy book solves 
the problem for us, but not for excelr as a whole.  If no one monitors the 
dummy book on the daily basis (which probably won't happen if there is no 
ownership), then you still have the possibility of positions falling into 
that book and never showing up in the book that they were intended.  Why 
can't a process be put in place for the initial set-up of a book in TAGG?

Tim,  The root problem was related to the default mapping logic in the 
'interface' job that moves the ERMS gas calc results to the portcalc results 
tables.  If mapping logic is not set up for a new book, the job was 
defaulting the gas deals to the ST-PLT desk.  The default mapping has been 
changed to a dummy  ZZ_erms book, which will prevent the deals from showing 
up in the wrong book if the mapping logic is not updated.

In reference to Beth's concerns... turns out this was a limitation in our 
production code, not an IT change to production data, so we should be OK on 
that front.  

The long-term solution would be to remove the hard-coded logic, set-up table 
structures, and maintain the mapping rules through a user screen.  Given our 
other priorities, and the default logic change, we will not pursue this 
option.

Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Steve

The problem is not that we should enter a reversing trade in the system as 
this would misrepresent the positions across the board.  The problem is that 
the position belongs to another book within Enpower.  The users have no 
access to the screens which define where our gas books are mapped in Enpower; 
therefore, IT has to manually define the correct mapping for us.  When the 
manual fix has not been made, we have true positions for one book mapped to 
another book.

Sorry about this.  A better question to ask is why are systems people 
manipulating data?  Why can't the users put on a reversing trade?  I'm having 
fits about IT resources touching production data and I can't tell you how 
many times we screw ourselves up because IT does this.

because of the audience of the e-mail.  This is the intended procedure for 
use of the dummy account:

Both the East and the West load gas books into the Enpower system nightly 
(this is not one person's responsibility but the entire group's 
responsibility).
Previously, the only message we get for this load is a success that all the 
books went somewhere in Enpower
With the installation of the new 'dummy' account, the message will now tell 
us if one of the books was loaded to this 'dummy' account
If an EOL bridge mistakenly puts gas deals in a power gas book that was not 
correctly mapped, the position would go to the 'dummy' account
If an EOL bridge mistakenly puts gas deals in a power gas book that WAS 
correctly mapped, the position would show up in that trader's gas positions
Depending on which load (East or West) has a book that was mapped to the 
'dummy' account will determine which group investigates (with IT) what & 
whose positions are now stored in 'dummy'

As you have indicated, manual processes do inevitably create errors.  The 
perfect procedure would be for the book to have complete and correct set up 
prior to having deals entered into it.  It would also be ideal if deals could 
not be entered into this book if setup was incomplete, but because this is an 
interface mapping problem to Enpower, the TAGG (gas) system does not 
recognize that the setup is incomplete.  I am not under the impression that 
the 'dummy' account is a perfect fix; however, with the new 'alert' it will 
provide us better data than we had before and it will keep the unmapped 
positions out of the West portfolio.

The only time the West would be affected by this change in the future is if a 
new power gas book is set up for your traders.

I hope I have addressed your concerns.  If I have not, please give me a call 
or e-mail me back.

happens if the person who is watching the dummy account is out sick or on

given the volatility of the commodities that we are trading and the fact that 
manual processes inevitably create errors (as is evidenced by a $7 million

up in the wrong book if the mapping logic is not updated.

In reference to Beth's concerns... turns out this was a limitation in our 
production code, not an IT change to production data, so we should be OK on 
that front.  

The long-term solution would be to remove the hard-coded logic, set-up table 
structures, and maintain the mapping rules through a user screen.  Given our 
other priorities, and the default logic change, we will not pursue this 
option.

Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

The problem is not that we should enter a reversing trade in the system as 
this would misrepresent the positions across the board.  The problem is that 
the position belongs to another book within Enpower.  The users have no 
access to the screens which define where our gas books are mapped in Enpower; 
therefore, IT has to manually define the correct mapping for us.  When the 
manual fix has not been made, we have true positions for one book mapped to 
another book.

Tim,

Sorry about this.  A better question to ask is why are systems people 
manipulating data?  Why can't the users put on a reversing trade?  I'm having 
fits about IT resources touching production data and I can't tell you how 
many times we screw ourselves up because IT does this. 

I'll let you know the end result.  Sorry again, but these practices have to 
stop!

words cannot describe how distressing this problem is.  in terms of 
mis-reporting our risk, we are dropping mmbtu's from some other book into our 
book as mwhs.  mmbtus go for around $10.  mwhs go for around $400.  why is 
this problem so hard to fix?

Please note that as of 2/13 there will still be 1,321 MWhs of Nymex Swap 
position in ST-PLT book (COB) which is yet to be cleared out by IT.   I have 
sent out an email to Norman Lee in IT and will follow up with him to make 
sure this problem is removed asap.  (The ""unknown"" position of the -311,354

Happy to help with Kristin's week of Doorstep work with EES. I'm glad she 
will still be in the building/Houston however, because we are all working our 
tails off up here - plenty of infrastructure work in progress.

On that - just a couple of other things to mention.

1. Kim/Leslie decided to keep Ellen W - with a revised/upgraded role - which 
is good for Ellen. I think Ellen's disappointment was that they told her she 
was 'good to go' on the Tuesday - and changed their minds on Wednesday - 
invoking the '12 months' rule. However - Ellen seems over it - and is pleased 
with her new role. Point to note - it took an external 'inquiry' to make them 
realise what a potential diamond they had - maybe they may of seen it earlier 
- just an observation.

2. I'm still a couple of good quality deal capture/documentation people 
short. I would gladly take any quality candidates you may like to suggest.

3. EnFiber - our valuation/risk management engine (a cannabilised version of 
EnPower) is up and running - and live.

Hope you are well.

the GCP set up.

We have quoted EES a rate of $20.00 per counterparty entered into the GCP 
Database.  We currently have 4 people working full time on the research, 
calling and entering of EES's CP's.  Beginning in January 2002, we anticipate 
utilizing a mutually agreed upon monthly fee.

Jason Moore and I are the designated Global contacts for EES in regard to GCP.



 GLOBAL  CONTRACTS  AND  GLOBAL  FACILITIES - 
 
In a February 16th meeting with Wanda Curry, Scott Mills, Mark Evans, and 
other EES personnel, EES indicated that they were leaning towards utilizing 
the Global Contracts Database.  We briefly discussed the Global Facilities 
Database, but we all have agreed to concentrate on the feasibility of the 
Contracts Database first and leave the Facilities implementation question for 
a later date.
  
As a result of the above mentioned meeting, we have an EES Demo set up for 
tomorrow morning from 9 A.M. - 12 P.M. in order to give EES personnel a 
""hands on"" demonstration of the functionality of Global Contracts.  A  
portion of EES's contracts include multiple commodities and staggering 
agreement terms that Global Contracts is now unable to capture.  Therefore, 
we will need to institute numerous system enhancements, with the co-operation 
of Global IT, in order to process EES' contracts.  The timing and IT manpower 
needs of these system enhancements will be discussed at our Demo by Global IT 
personnel.

If EES does agree to utilize Global Contracts and Facilities we will need to 
set up a separate EES maintenance group within Global.  

EES has informed us that they would like to do all of their Contracts Data 
input.  Therefore, we anticipate the use of 3 Global Contracts personnel for 
the training of EES'  personnel.  Two Global employees would be assigned to 
work directly with EES's personnel on a daily basis.  The remaining Global 
Contracts person would act as a ""Help Desk"" here on 37 to answer any Global 
Contracts questions. 

In regard to billing EES for the Global Contracts Database assistance, we are 
proposing the use of a ""flat rate""  monthly fee structure, similar to the one 
utilized  for Bridgeline Gas Pipeline.   We would also include a ""start up"" 
fee to cover the cost of the initial  IT system enhancements.

India is in the process of looking at potential deals but has not signed any

only be doing a few structured deals and no trading. 

Heidi, Milind and I went over the checklist together and the results indicate

talked to a number of people about their plans but have not formalized 
anything as of yet.  Also, I'm not sure they yet appreciate the number of

have commenced.

ISSUE

The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure=20
(OBSF) pre year-end to meet excelr requirements for gearing ratios.

Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being=
=20
bearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value o=
f=20
which depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given t=
he=20
hard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially=
=20
took place on spreadsheets.

The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business=20
should not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on=20
balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement=
s,=20
particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in=
=20
the AS400. With the specified functionality it is believed that all=20
operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed=20
satisfactorily.

The core functionality, which was due prior to the year-end, was released=
=20
during January but was subsequently found to have introduced =01+bugs=01, t=
o the=20
integrated business control processes. Whilst an improvement on having no=
=20
OBSF functionality, the =01+bugs=01, have had an increasingly negative effe=
ct on=20
the control environment, compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a=
=20
guaranteed delivery for the =01+bug=01, fixes and non core =01,reporting=01=
,=20
functionality.

This has given rise to the following concerns:

? There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at =
a=20
brand & location level to coordination records (the global position is=20
reconciled however).
? It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM&CL as:
? a) P&L on spread moves from Cash to 3 months positions (and related cash =
to=20
3 months provisions) can not be produced by the system and must be estimate=
d,=20
and
? b) System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values.

These concerns are compounded by the following:

? The most experienced AS400 IT developer for the EM&CL business has=20
resigned. He is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in=
=20
July 2001.
? The most experienced AS400 IT developer on the EML side of the business h=
as=20
also resigned. He left in January 2001.=20
? There is no documentation for the AS400. It is therefore difficult for=20
experienced AS400 programmers to get upto speed on the system.

Conclusion

It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the=20
AS400 system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays. The=
=20
current situation has arisen due to non-delivery of IT developments and tig=
ht=20
timescales on the finalisation of the OBSF facility.

To meet Q1 end requirements (i.e. full production of the DPR and stock=20

I enjoyed speaking with you last week.  As promised, below are proposed
times for a meeting in Houston to explore the opportunity we have to
offer in more detail.  I have also spoken with representatives in excelr
Online regarding your desire to receive a feed of deal data from EOL and
should have someone available to discuss potential solutions with you.

Here are some proposed dates/times to pick from.  Let me know what suits
your schedule best.  We're thinking we'll spend the first bit of time
giving you an overview of what we're working on and proposing and then
go from there.  We'll probably spend at most 2 hours in this first
meeting.

Wednesday 3/7    anytime between 10-5
Thursday     3/8  anytime between 8-12
Friday         3/9  anytime between 11-5

We would also enjoy the opportunity to treat you to lunch if scheduling
permits.  Let me know which day/time works best for you and I will
proceed with finalizing the schedule.

Just visited with the coordinator of Josephine's House.   Here's some
additional info. - and we have a few questions to answer:

1) I have reserved the place on my credit card - there will be no actual
charge until the day of the event.

2) For a party of our size, they will offer a choice of soup or salad, 3
entrees and 2 desserts.   If we have a special request, we can let her know;
otherwise the choices will simply be from whatever the Jeffery's chef has
cookin' that night.

3) We need to choose either a soup or a salad for our group.    Preferences?

4) At some point, we will need to decide if we want to do hors deuvres in
addition to the three course meal.   She suggested oysters (for which they
are famous) and then some other, non-seafood appetizer.  These would be
served as guests arrive.

5)  She is faxing me a wine list - and would like to have our selection in
advance of the event.   Also, she asked if we wanted beer and an open bar in
addition to wine.   I told her I'd check with you - but that we wouldn't be
a heavy drinking crowd and that wine would probably be fine.    I thought we
might also want to do champagne - either with the appetizers or sometime
during the meal (maybe dessert?) in case we want to give a toast to the
happy couple.

Thoughts, everyone?      -the youngest and fattest

Objective
excelr is sizing up the opportunity to offer internal back office processing=
=20
services to external clients. Objective of this meeting was to understand t=
he=20
spreadsheet meant to estimate the potential P&L for this offering.
Overview
Looked at spreadsheet for validation:
? Need to better determine the actual market for this service.
? Need to better understand the current revenue and expense projections and=
=20
assumptions, expanding on them to include customers not currently with Enro=
n.
Ongoing:
Defining the size of the market:
? There may be three =01+levels=01, of markets for these services - one for=
 energy=20
risk mgt. ops (attack first), a larger market if we include global market=
=20
offerings, and yet a larger market if we think of our offering as transacti=
on=20
processing, ala ADP.
? There are a number of ways to derive the potential market size.  The=20
current spreadsheet identifies existing customers.  Some may be seeking our=
=20
services based on their current and projected deal volumes. =20
? Fred will continue to analyze the market size(s), adding customers outsid=
e=20
of current EOL spectrum.
? Fred will analyze the offerings and pricing structures used by competitor=
s.=20
? Sheri will get with internal data owners to (in)validate current=20
spreadsheet numbers and identify customers with high year-over-year increas=
es=20
in EOL transaction volume.

Expenses
? James will take a harder look at the expenses.  We wonder if number of=20
transactions is the best method to use.  What is the real cost driver?  Whe=
re=20
are the =01+breaking points=01,, or transaction levels where we must invest=
 further=20
to offer services to additional customers?

Strategy
? Beth Apollo will schedule a meeting with Beth Perlman, Jenny Rub, Rahil, =
et=20
al to discuss ongoing big picture.
? Beth will also schedule a meeting with Mark Taylor, to include Rahil and=
=20
Dale.  They will discuss points on the service level agreement that we will=

Subject: Single deal entry

Jeff,

I just found out that the development of phase1 single deal entry project 
didn't start as scheduled due to resource constraints. Therefore, the 
development won't be done until mid of April. Sorry for the delay. I will 
make sure to deliver it to you for testing by the middle of April. After 
consulting Russ and Sitara-TDS team, the phase1 single deal entry will allow 
users to enter simple types of physical deals at deal creation time. It does 
not provide any editing functionality. In other words, once the deals are 
saved to the system, any changes need to be done through both TAGG and 
Sitara. Please see below for a short list of complex deals that are not going 
to be captured in phase1. Russ helped me put the list together.


Deal Types not Captured in the Phase1-Single-Deal-Capture

1. Deals with multiple locations each of which has different cost of gas 
because TAGG does not capture location information. For example, a 
10-location deal will result in 1 Sitara deal with 10 CPR   tickets and 10 
TAGG legs. Each Tagg leg capturing the risk between contract price and mid 
for that location.
2. Structured deals which have different volume for different months and 
whose different risk components will be managed by different desks.
3. Tiered pricing structured deals that require one Sitara ticket and more 
than one TAGG ticket. For example, 15,000 deal volume in broken down to 5,000 
at fixed price, 5,000 at NYMEX - 0.10 and 5,000 at the index.
4. Physical options because TDS deal capture does not handle physical 
options. 
5. Trigger deals that allow setting prices before index settles.  Basic 
trigger deal can be captured.  Entry problem relates if price trigger is 
managed in a different book, or if different volume is triggered or 
untriggered, than the original deal volume.
6. Physical index deals with the index that is different from the mid for the 
location. Such deals need to be broken down into an index, a long basis and a 
short basis in TAGG.
7. Percentage index deals that require two legs in TAGG. One leg is index 
flat and the other is fixed price deal with zero fixed price and zero basis 
and reduced quantity. For example, a 90% index deal with a quantity of 5000 
can be broken down into one leg of index flat and the other leg of zero 
fixed-price and zero basis and a quantity of 5000*0.1 = 500.
8. Floating basis deals.  Deals can be entered with a price and physical 
premium component where the basis will default to the actual basis settle. 
These deals are sometimes entered as trigger deals with a floating basis.  
The deal looks like a straight index deal, however the price can be triggered 
and the basis will default to actual. 



I would appreciate your comments.

Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power 
volatilities and correlations

As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power 
traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option 
portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that 
the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in 
their mark.

In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light. 
Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as 
this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a 
matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you 
may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the 
deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. 

The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue 
for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at 
the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot 
use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise 
options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any 
way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the 
few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' 
piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of 
worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the 
correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) 
the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  
underlying. 

They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel 
who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most 
experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). 
This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of 
excelr's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the 
volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that 
different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value 
the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns 
over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it 
does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc 
calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike 
price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the 
forward price of the underlying itself. 

We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in 
Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start 
to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.

Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or 
gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no 
there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure 
given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what 
the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have 
Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega 
or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to 
work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like 
to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem 
(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the 
implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current 
system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we 
validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?

Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher 
volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their 
VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily 
remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol 
curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any 
testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). 
The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the 
impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.

I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing 
the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been 
covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having 
to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and 
are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies 
of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have 
not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in 
gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that 
it is not for a lack of trying.

Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived 
inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.

It has been a very successful year for the excelr / Razorfish VMS project 
Team.  We have been developing a Direct Access Power Market, user managed, 
tariff based calculation engine and customer expense / revenue allocation 
application.

The efforts which have taken place to date will benefit each of us as we move 
forward into these deregulated Direct Access markets.  The current 
application has gone through the following evolution:

Project Definition & Design documentation
Database Design / Development
User Interface Design / Development
Communication layer (COM) Design / Development
Hardware requisition / Implementation (Development / Test / Production)
Arthur Anderson Audit (Passed Audit review - Application meets all minimum 
requirements)
The Major Functionality / Action Items which have been delivered to date:
Security Management (Only IT Resources to have access)
Event / Task Management & Reporting
Component / Equations Management & Reporting
Estimation Generation Management & Reporting
Counter Party Profile Management & Reporting
Settlement Entity Profile Management & Reporting
Deal-Upload Management & Reporting
Integrated Dispute Management & Reporting
Customer Generation Charge Profile & Reporting
Historical Data Conversion mechanism
95 % of Calculation Engine Original Functional Requirements

The Major Functionality which is under it's final steps of Development and 
User Test
Reconciliation (Exception Identification, Allocation & Reporting)
Settlement Entity - Settlement Statement / Invoice Parsing & Reporting
Remaining 5% of Calculation Engine Functionality

Over the past 12+ months a total of $3 MM dollars has been spend on VMS.  We 
are reaching the final phase of this project and I am not sensing that 
everyone is still on board with this being OUR (excelr) Volume Management 
strategic solutions for Direct Access Power Markets.

As of March 1, 2001 we no longer have a contract in place with Razorfish.  
Razorfish has provided six developers dedicated to assist the excelr Networks 
IT staff in delivering the VMS solution over the past year.  These resources 
have been key in helping us get to where we are today.  In addition we had 
originally planned to retain these resources over the remainder of 2001 
(03/2001 - 12/2001) to assist with the implementation of VMS on the West & 
East Desk and in the Toronto Canada office.  Without a contract in place and 
currently working on good faith.  The project has come to a serious point of 
action.  Razorfish is asking for a total of $728,000 for services rendered 
between 3/1/2001 and 6/30/2001.  They will keep the resources dedicated to 
the project and will deliver the following:
Finalise base product development, assist in unit / user testing and 
Implement base VMS Product in Production.
Application Production Support for 30 Days post Implementation
Transition of knowledge base from Razorfish resources to excelr Networks IT 
resources

Razorfish is willing to discuss terms to assist excelr throughout the 
remainder of the year.  However,  I don't feel that everyone is ready to make 
that decision.  We do however need to make a final decision on this first 
implementation.

As I have stated prior in this document,  ""We have accomplished a lot over 
the past year.""  Without the continued assistance from the Razorfish portion 
of the VMS team.  I don't see any of us meeting our 2001 Volume Management 
(VM) Direct Access Power Market objectives in a more efficient or economical 
fashion.  In some cases I don't see it being possible at all.

It is time to make a decision.  Do we all agree that we need to move forward 
and retain Razorfish services for the additional $728,000 and incur each of 
OUR allocation of the over all VMS capitalised project total cost or do we 
stop where we are and find other solution to address our needs and debate 
over who was in agreement in the beginning of the project in order to 
determine who picks up the $3 MM already spent.

Please provide me with your response by 5:00 PM PT to allow me to get back to 
Razorfish with a well deserved response by Friday.

Philippe, Greg, Rex -

We have followed up with CGI on their ""secret"" target for our applications.  
It is CMS Energy
across town.   They will be presenting a careful (and short) concept proposal 
to them on the 26th of March.

Initial feedback on excelr being part of the solution was very positive by the 
business owner of the
rearchitecture.  Apparently, there is a significant process flow rework going 
on at the same time
and the business owner reports to the CEO on both topics.

We are in early in the process so there is room to still influence the 
overall approach they take,
according to CGI.

this is going to be!)

excelrOnline
Offering products on other exchanges (HoustonStreet and True Quote).  We are 
going to offer specific products (various Gas and Power products) to 
customers who have execute rights to these products on these two platforms.  
Therefore, we will have three feeds to deal with and will need new 
applications built to support the interfaces.  We will be responsible for 
adding/deleting products, ensuring the sites match ours, reporting trades on 
these systems, bridging applicable data to downstream systems, etc.  excelr 
gets an equity ownership in the platforms depending on activity.
Opening up excelrOnline to brokers.  We are negotiating with three brokers 
right now.  They will have to pay a one year licensing fee to have access to 
the site, and we will allow them to transact for specific counterparties 
only.  We will also need applications built and establish specific processes 
to support this.
Wish List - we have a list of approx. 180 times that we need the developers 
to work on for us.  Jay Webb committed to Louise a few weeks back (when I was 
in her office) that we would get a resource (specifically Chris Luttrel and 
his team).  I think you are aware of this.  Chris is now moving on to do 
something else and none of our items have been addressed in three weeks.  We 
have had weekly meetings the last three weeks with the IT team (Mark Dilworth 
and company...).  Basically, since Mark has decided to leave the group, 
nothing is being addressed.  I am going to speak to Dave tomorrow about this 
and escalate from there necessary.  This needs a more detailed explanation - 
I am going to try to get some time with you next week.
Steel - I will discuss with Dave tomorrow.  He basically told me not to do 
anything (another topic of discussion....)
We are working on enhancing our existing intranet site for the PCG
Louise has asked that I not allocate any of the PCG time to Europe - I don't 
agree with this because I have four people preparing the management report on 
a daily basis and I have a call center that also supports Europe.  I tried to 
argue my point but did not get very far : )  I am going to talk to Dave about 
it some more.
Working on bridging to Thunderball and the new weather application
Legal/Credit - we do not always get timely responses from the groups - Credit 
is improving (they hired a new person), but Legal has one person responsible 
for new CP set up (Tana Jones).  When she is out, all application processing 
stops.  I am going to talk to Mark Taylor about appointing a back up at a 
minimum.  Tana does a great job, but our activity is really increasing (she 
also supports Clickpaper), so it is becoming an issue.
We have set another record today - we have already done 3,358 trades!!!!
No new news from Canada on power trading - Legal needs to sign off.  In Mark 
Taylor's shop
Argentina in the works - probably end of month. 

Clickpaper
We have so much, I am not sure where to start.  I had lunch today with Jeff 
Harbert to discuss what our needs were.  We need tools from reporting to 
credit...  
The commercial group is really wanting to start offering more products, and 
are starting to hire marketing people and traders.  The activity is really 
picking up
The contractors are working weekends (Call Center).  I am working the 
Commercial group to discontinue this.  We are not even getting that many 
calls during the week, and we have not received one call on Sat/Sun since 
launch (July)

Commodity Logic
Dale has been very involved in all the discussions and has been a great 
resource (I have received several compliments from the NetWorks team on his 
contribution)
They have not yet released the first module (Financial Mgmt - CFO).  Should 
be very soon

DealBench
No external customers - very slow developing....  Staying involved and in 
touch with the Commercial team

Other
I am still looking for an assistant.  I sent five resumes down to staffing 
and a week later the interviews were not scheduled.  I went down to complain 
and two of them were scheduled.   A week later, the other three were yet to 
be scheduled, so I am doing it myself.  I think we have some real issues in 
the staffing group - this is not the first time.
We are working on Disaster Recovery for the group.  
Super Saturday - I would like our team to participate.  Do you have an idea 
of who all is interviewing?  We would like to be involved.
We are looking at holiday coverage now to ensure we have coverage
I talked to Mary Sloan (SAP) and Keith Clark (Call Center) is working with 
her.  I think she really appreciates the help/input.  
Have you had a chance to review the announcement letter re:reorg?

Hector:  The key employees that Jeff has identified are senior specialists, 
with the exception of Will Kelly.  If you remember, these are the risk 
employees that I was concerned about when Steve Jackson tendered his letter 
of resignation.  Steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor, and 
it is not inconceivable that he might approach some excelr employees to join 
him and help ensure his success with his new employer.  We don't want this to 
happen.  Waiting until the end of November to implement an effective 
retention plan does not make sense.  Please call me tomorrow and let's talk

I spoke with Todd Burke regarding a retention strategy for the managers we

completes the pay practices survery by Mid-November in order to accurately 
compensate them.   He is concerned that we may present an inaccurate plan for 
retention without market data.

Notes for this Week's Report:

*  North American Gas has kept its overall average daily EOL deal count 
steady at about 2,950 trades a day since January.  This is about 180 trades a 
day less than the November average of 3,130, which is still the Life to Date 
high.  The overall average daily EOL volumes have remained steady as well.

*  The East and Central Regions of North American Gas have been the main 
reason EOL Gas transactions have remained steady.  The East Region has 
increased its overall average daily EOL deal count by about 20% since 
January, from 632 to 798 deals per day.  The Central Region has increased its

Ann Marie is our new HR Analyst on rotation with our HR team.  
The phrase, ""We still need to review 51 ""Satisfactory"" evaluations"", was a 
disclosure to Sally that the 51 evaluations have not been forwarded to HR for 
review.   I did not mean to imply that we were holding any evaluations 
because we have provided same or next day turn around on the evaluations that 
I received.    
As I read the e-mail, I am concerned that you might be under the impression 
that I have not provided quick turn-around to one or more members of your 
group.   If that is the case and I have not misinterpreted your e-mail, I 
would like the opportunity to address the issue with your staff so that I can 
correct the situation.   Has a manager told you that I held up an evaluation?
I do not have any ""satisfactory"" evaluations in my possesion that I am 
reviewing at this time.   
I wish you had told me of any issues that you perceived were delaying your 
evaluations because frankly, it was Sally that wanted us to review the 
satisfactory or below evaluations.   
Thanks for bringing the matter to my attention.   I was not aware that you 
thought the situation had become ridiculous and I would like to do everything 
possible to avoid giving you that impression.

The excelr-wide PRC meeting to review the mid-year performance for all Vice 
Presidents has been rescheduled several times.  Currently, this meeting is 
set for September 11 and 12.  Per David Oxley, performance reviews for Vice 
Presidents should be conducted after this PRC process is completed.  Assuming 
that the meeting takes place as now planned in September, I will schedule 
your reviews sometime after September 12.  (Bob, I will assume that your 
review will be given by Rock, but I will keep you informed on this process 
along with Peggy and Brent.)

On another note, excelr hosts an annual management conference each year for 
Vice President level and above.  You should all receive invitations to this 
event.  In recent years, it has been held in San Antonio.  I do not know the 
location for this year, but I do have the dates for you to hold on your

process...  I thought I would share a few things with you.  The primary 
concern was that an individual was representing ""our"" people, and they 1) did 
not know them 2) did not know what they did 3) probably could not adequately 
answer questions about that person and his/her performance and job 
responsibilities.  Although I think the manager's in my group did an 
excellent job of providing feedback and accomplishments (the two analysts 
rankings in our group did not change from excellent), they were really uneasy 
about someone independent of our group representing them.  

Also, in general, it seems like the analysts are getting conflicting messages 
about the ""third"" rotation and the option of going back to school, staying 
with the company, etc.  I think a good idea would be to provide some clear, 
written message to the analysts and us about the program and how it is going 
to work going forward.  It surer seems like it changes every 6 months...  

Hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any questions.

We need to finalize the 4 models that have a high, low and expected case for 
our businesses.  They are CommodityLogic, DealBench, TransactionHub and 
Mid/Back Office.  DealBench should be built as an ASP as discussed, 
CommodityLogic as an ASP, TransactionHub as we have discussed and back office 
as you are working with Sally.      

We first need to agree on all the assumptions for revenue that lead to each 
case suggested above for each business.  We then need to agree on 5 to 10 
years of expenses so we can reach an operating margin we agree upon.  We then 
finally need to look at them and see what capital investment might be needed 
to go in to each one and then finally build a pretax income statement and 
pretax cash flow statement for each business.

The goal is to determine, within a range, the present value of each business, 
based on certain assumptions, and then to determine what they are worth as a 
company.

I know we are part way there on all of these initiatives, but I want this all 
finished as follows:

TransactionHub - Friday afternoon the 16th.

CommodityLogic - Tuesday afternoon the 19th

DealBench - Wednesday afternoon the 17th

Mid/Back Office - Friday the 23rd

Remember, we are trying to get a range that is approximately right that we 
can all believe.

Subject: update

Just a couple of things, since we will not be able to meet this week.

The auditors have started review no. 2 of the management report.  I imagine 
it will take them at least a couple of weeks  per Louise's request, the 
auditors are re-reviewing the management report to ensure that all the 
changes were made and the report is now accurate
I think you are aware of all the new products Dale is working on (!!!) we 
have several things in the works right now, the primary ones being a park and 
loan agreement that will be managed out of Chicago, and reliable power
Lots and lots of ad hoc reporting (see my earlier e-mail regarding timing of 
these reports - we need a decision quickly - this is taking up most of Matt's 
time, and with the additional reports requested, it will take up the rest of 
it)  I have been sending you the weekly reports we are doing to John and 
Jeff.  Louise asked that we provide similar reports for Europe.  We are 
starting this week on these
We really need to push the profiles manager application - we are getting 
swamped with all the new customers and products (Frank was to talk to Mark D. 
on Friday - I should have an update from him today)  this new application 
will save a ton of manual work - this is something we started as soon as I 
took over the group, and also was one of the auditors comments.  Currently, 
we are manually entering profiles directly into EOL.  This application we 
requested will allow each of the depts (Credit, Global and Legal) to enter 
their own profiles into EOL, and we will just become the reviewer of the data 
via daily reporting.  The application has been tested, but due to the fact 
that the IT group is so busy, we have been placed on the back-burner.  I am 
going to turn up the heat on this b/c we are getting overloaded.
New reporting application - we are in the process of testing now.   It will 
probably be at least a month before it is completed.  This is our new Oracle 
application that will replace the Access report Euginio built
Torrey will be attending the 8am meeting for me in the morning and will send 
me notes  this is the weekly marketing/phase 2 meeting
I am currently reviewing the latest version of the price posting agreement to 
determine what our roles will be once we are posting prices on the other 
platforms (looks like most of it will fall in Dale's world)  You probably saw 
the announcement that we are going to post prices on other websites 
(HoustonStreet and True Quote) that was made on Thursday last week.  
Basically, we have 90 days to make this happen.  IT will build the link to 
these other sites, and we will need to ensure that price are reflected 
properly and that product long and short descriptions are accurate.  I have 
read about 25% of the agreement thus far and am developing a list of 
questions and concerns surrounding this.
We still are not including the proper weather valuation in the management 
report - the numbers are not going to be significant, but we need to report 
this appropriately asap.  Any decision here?  We have been working with the 
weather risk groups to determine how to appropriately value the weather 
transactions.  About a month ago, we reached an agreement with them and have 
been waiting on Dave's approval to change the valuation ever since.  
Keith has made some suggestions on how we can improve the Remedy application 
- I am reviewing while I am here  This is the application that the call 
center uses to track issues
I will send you the suggestions Stephanie has for improving the new security 
application - she will document these for me today  A new SRRS system is in 
place via the Intranet. 

stuff for you -
Carrie S. will begin her 6 month assignment now.  She will be in Australia 
for 3 weeks to assist Justin (the PCG person in the Pacific), then to London 
for a month to work with Amita, and the duration will be spent working with 
the London EOL Marketing team
Justin just completed 3 weeks of training on EOL and EOL applications.  I 
think he will do an excellent job - I was very impressed with his questions 
and how quickly he picked things up.


Just send me any questions you have -

Thanks
Sheri

this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the excelr VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the excelr A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Beth,

The information we need to complete the analysis is included in the document 
we outlined this morning. Fred and Rahil are working on getting volumes for 
your group to estimate the marginal cost per transaction at different volume 
levels. We will use that information to estimate the cost side going forward. 
On the revenue side I believe that it can be misleading to use a cost plus 
approach and that we will be better off estimating the price counterparties 
are willing to pay for the service based on market comparables from the 
benchmarking studies Sally contracted a while ago. We will also take into 
account for pricing other variables as the contingent liability risks that 
they are avoiding by outsourcing their back office function and the issue of 
information confidentiality.

Thanks   for the note -- that helps to put it into perspective.  
Unfortunately, since Sally is out this week, I had not seen this note.

James has all of the marginal cost information, which can be used to work 
from  - I still believe that the approach we discussed in our meeting before 
lunch today is the right one.  We need to create some customer profiles which 
include the number of transactions at each level and for each of the 
potential services to calculate some potential cost base scenarios ---  from 
which we can gross up to a potential revenue number.  

Rahil -- I would like to discuss the next steps, and who we put on point 
(specifically) for each task.

Subject: Mid Year Review Info Needed

I need a one page summary for all of your employees before I leave for London 
on Monday, July 10th.  I need this summary and all customer feedback 
delivered to Sue as soon as possible for aggregation.

These are the items I need:

Employee Name

Title

Brief Job Description and Day to Day Responsibilities

Areas of Strengths with Specific Examples

Areas of Improvement with Detailed Strategy and Direction for necessary 
improvement

Accomplishments / Process Improvements Employee made, did, or was part of

What this employee Did / Did not do in the first six months that made your 
life Easier / Harder (Met / Exceeded / Did Not Exceed Expectations)

What you need from each employee in order to help you move your group forward


I really think this should be no greater than one page.  While I am familiar 
with most if not all of these employees, I DO NOT know all of the above 
criteria for everyone.  These are the types of issues I anticipate being 
raised at the larger PRC and I need to make sure that I can answer any 
question raised.

I will sit down with each one of you and discuss each employee page 
individually after the PRC.  I would like to use this page as the PRIMARY 
feedback form for us to deliver to each employee.  This should supplement the 
system feedback form that we have used in the past.  At that time, I plan to 
roll out a group strategy and what is going to be expected from you and your 
groups in order for all of us to accomplish the known goals and objectives of 
our business.  I anticipate having these meetings completed by the end of 
July with feedback beginning around August 1st and finished by August 31st.  
This will give us plenty of time to plan around any issues that arise, 
however I would encourage you to get the feedback completed as soon as 
possible.

Last but by no means least, I would like to thank each and everyone of you 
for all of your hardwork and dedication to our business.  We have had many 
achievements and accomplishments and have taken on many new challenges and 
opportunities.  This is a direct compliment to you and I wanted to say THANK 
YOU!

Have a GREAT Holiday Weekend!

Subject: RE: CGI Proposal Update

Greg and Rex,

Thanks for the input.  I will try to contact Beth Apollo.  

Here are a few points I think will help.  

? I also read the partnering agreement carefully and sent the revised copy to 
Travis McCullough this morning
? At this time I believe our risk is quite low, as we are not officially part 
of the bid yet
? I will work very hard to keep everyone informed

The following points protect excelr from significant risk:

  1)  We were quite careful about what we sent to CSG (reviewed by Beth, 
David, Rahul and myself)
  2)  We did not quote any price for software or services
  3) The original RFP asked for a custom solution, which CGI is proposing. We 
do not participate in this work.
  4) The option to take a different approach (e.g. leverage existing software 
from a partner) is being proposed by CSG as an alternative approach, but is 
not priced.  The option would be explored during a ""make versus buy"" analysis 
within CSG's methodology (during the initial requirements and design phase).  
This gives us time to clarify our plans.

I hope these points might mitigate any concerns over the rapid time frame of 
the proposal.  As the proposal is due on Monday, I am not sure if there is 
time to engage a large number of reviewers, but I will ask CSG to copy Rahul 
and hopefully he can get appropriate input.

A brief update:

I spoke with the proposal leads at CGI (Greg Felton and Company) this 
morning, and all appears to be on schedule.

? Greg communicated our joint approach to the client and they are very 
interested
? Greg received excelr's materials and they are more than sufficient for our 
current proposal needs
? I received a draft of CGI's proposed teaming agreement.  I made made edits 
according to my knowledge of excelr's legal policies.  I will forward the 
document to legal if CGI accepts the changes
? Greg will complete CGI's initial proposal and forward the draft to excelr, 
for review, this weekend and on Monday
? The proposal is due Monday PM to CMS
? Presentations to CMS by potential vendors will occur on March 26th-28th.  
We should think about who attends and at what point we might want to use our 
internal contacts to approach the client.  For now we are waiting, based on 
CGI's advice.
? Since the client is in the requirements phase, we should think about how we 
might want to support that process, given our approach to delivering systems 
solutions

Thanks for everyone's support.

I am addressing the 'undue influence' issue via the PRC process, but we all 
know that this is a partial solution - it's about changing the culture 
(Europe isn't any better or worse in this respect) and this is a more 
intransigent problem that we need to work at every single day (I have to say 
that the Helsinki scare was really helpful in this respect - I think you 
would notice a difference).

I'll ask James and Mike to follow up on your specific points.

Subject: Re: UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors - o1.1m hit  


Sorry to hear about this one. 

I have some observations to make from my reading (and re-reading) of the 
account:

1 It looks like the old ""undue influence"" problem again. It seems some 
attempts were made by operations to follow up, but nothing happened. 

We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don't 
have any way to protect them if they do - there is still the fear that if 
they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career. And that 
is because twice a year, at the PRC, that can happen. This incident shows 
some of these attributes.

For the operations process to be effective there has to be (and be seen to 
be) little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of 
the operations staff. 

2 Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm 
the basis on which they signed it.

3 Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers ? Brokerage is in 
the P&L and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage 
is at the agreed rate, they should simply pay the brokerage.

4 Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable - it should be done same 
day. I would not have waited for the traders to do it, but I would want to 
know why it took them so long.

5 Given that these (short) trades were absent from the portfolio during a 
highly volatile period of rising prices, I would wonder about motivation in 
addressing the position during this time. Essentially, if it had been correct 
we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did.

I would pursue explanations to points 2, 4 and 5. 

DP

Subject: UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors - o1.1m hit


On the 7th of June Gas Risk Management became aware that two'late' trades had 
been entered into the gas trader's 'Blue book' which were both being booked 
significantly late and had a material negative P&L impact (negative o1.1m). 
The 'late' deals were done on the 3rd of February (Marcello Romano) and the 
30th of March (Haakon Olafson) and were both forward starting sells for 
periods in 2003-2004.

Background

1) Input errors

For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal 
input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most 
significant number coming form the UK Gas traders. Numerous errors have been 
found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness 
of entering deals into the 'blue book' (the Gas traders are currently the 
only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation 
system - there is currently a big push to change this which has the support 
of John Sherriff with a deadline date of 31 July).

In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted 
booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen. A log of 
all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May 
which highlights an error rate of 12%-15% of non EOL trades. This has been 
discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expected.

2) Deal booking and reconciliation process (Non EOL trades)

Deals are initially written into the 'blue book' by the gas traders when the 
deal is done. This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are 
the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day.

Faxed broker statements are received (usually) by documentation the next day 
and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by 
documentation liasing with the traders as necessary. At this time brokers 
were faxing one statement per trade (relevant later).

3) New Deal sign off

As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is 
signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and 
the implied origination P&L. For the 3rd of February Marcello signed off the 
new deals sheet and for the 30th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed off.

4) Documentation convention

In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation. 
(relevant later). Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after 
trade booking.

5) Brokerage invoices

Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then 
reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the 
deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to 
authorise for payment. Any deals which cannot be found are raised with 
documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders.


Specific details of these 'late' trades

1) Summary

For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving, or can it be 
established that we did not receive, a broker statement which is a primary 
control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals. 

As excelr was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from 
either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade.

The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements 
in April and was completed by the 20th with the invoices falling due for 
payment on the 27th. The work practice at that time was that brokerage 
invoices (including those with non reconciling trade queries) were batched 
together and passed to the traders. This would have taken place on the 27th 
of April. Details on exactly what was said and done in the 3 weeks between 
passing these invoices to the traders for approval (although there are claims 
that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions) and when a mailed 
follow up was made on the 22nd of May are hazy. What is clear is that on the 
22nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted excelr to try to confirm their position 
which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred.

Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals 
being booked on the 6th of June.

2) Deal specifics

EES Broker - Morgan Stanley trade on 3 Feb 2000
Trader Marcello
EES Invoice date 1 March; Invoice received before 15 March as settlements 
started checking it. (Keren Perrott - settlements started on 13 March)
Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Emma Thomson)
Traders contacted  on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was sent on 22 May 
as requested by documentation to prove deal.
Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.


IEB Broker - NP trade on 30 Mar 2000
Trader Haakon
IEB invoice date 6 April; Invoice received before 27 April as settlements 
started checking it. (Keren Perrott)
Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Robert Vaughn)
Traders contacted on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was requested.
Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.



 Who was at fault and where did the control break down ?

I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but 
there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that 
can be made and drawn.

Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas trader's accuracy and 
prioritisation of booking trades. Despite numerous conversations on the 
subject very little improvement has been seen. It has now got to the stage 
where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the 
error was and who made it. This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis 
every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time 
trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to 
avoid the incidence of errors such as this. The current error rate is 12% - 
15% of non EOL trades. Documentation currently estimate that in 9 times out 
of 10 the broker or counterparty are correct.

Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to 
provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will 
eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately 
obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived. Most brokers have now 
changed but one or two still send one statement per trade. Reconciliation's 
of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced.

Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow 
up more vigorously (and by mail) errors and omissions on a more timely basis. 
There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by 
settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders. This is 
causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment.

Action Points

Trading

Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk

Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking

Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis

Trade Support

Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices

Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual 
deal statements

All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate

Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the 
broker records

Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree 
our forward position from July 2000 to September 2006 (the traded part of the 
curve)

to have Patti connect me with you during my commute on Tuesday morning.  I 
start with a 7:30 meeting (Houston time), so I should be in my car from 6:30

I let Nikki know about a rescheduled date from Rick's PRC last week.  I don't 
think that there had been any widespread communication about the new date of 
June 27.  Will you still plan to come to Houston next week?  I have scheduled 
dinner for us on Wednesday evening, assuming that you will still make the 
trip.  Just let me know.  Will you also be back for the meeting on June 27?  

Before you left for vacation I had tried to reach you regarding the MG 
acquisition.  That should make life fun for you!  I wanted to talk about 
resources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence 
efforts and longer term in the assimilation.  As in my voice mail, I believe 
that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a 
controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they 
run their business.  It seems that might help jump start the plans around how 
best to assimilate the business.  I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson, 
as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already 
been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and 
in other locations.  Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell  who 
seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.   I don't know the 
names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is 
unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.  We can 
hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning.    ",Non Abusive

I did not understand that Promotions are to be discussed prior to the meeting 
with Sally nor did I understand that the employee had to be in their role for

You need to work for Sally Beck on this.  She is responsible for this and is 
a Managing Director responsible for all mid and back office, outsourcing or 
otherwise.  She must approve anything that goes out becuase it will effect 
her directly.

Phillipe is also very reluctant to ""sell"" any systems, especially if we have 
to support applications installed behind their firewall.  We are probably 
fine with most ASP models.  You need to meet with Sally as team on this ASAP.

After meeting with Sally, let me know what everyone agreed on.  I am in all 
day.

Thanks.

Subject: RE: CGI Proposal Update

Greg and Rex,

Thanks for the input.  I will try to contact Beth Apollo.  

Here are a few points I think will help.  

? I also read the partnering agreement carefully and sent the revised copy to 
Travis McCullough this morning
? At this time I believe our risk is quite low, as we are not officially part 
of the bid yet
? I will work very hard to keep everyone informed

The following points protect excelr from significant risk:

  1)  We were quite careful about what we sent to CSG (reviewed by Beth, 
David, Rahul and myself)
  2)  We did not quote any price for software or services
  3) The original RFP asked for a custom solution, which CGI is proposing. We 
do not participate in this work.
  4) The option to take a different approach (e.g. leverage existing software 
from a partner) is being proposed by CSG as an alternative approach, but is 
not priced.  The option would be explored during a ""make versus buy"" analysis 
within CSG's methodology (during the initial requirements and design phase).  
This gives us time to clarify our plans.

I hope these points might mitigate any concerns over the rapid time frame of 
the proposal.  As the proposal is due on Monday, I am not sure if there is 
time to engage a large number of reviewers, but I will ask CSG to copy Rahul 
and hopefully he can get appropriate input.

- Steve

A brief update:

I spoke with the proposal leads at CGI (Greg Felton and Company) this 
morning, and all appears to be on schedule.

? Greg communicated our joint approach to the client and they are very 
interested
? Greg received excelr's materials and they are more than sufficient for our 
current proposal needs
? I received a draft of CGI's proposed teaming agreement.  I made made edits 
according to my knowledge of excelr's legal policies.  I will forward the 
document to legal if CGI accepts the changes
? Greg will complete CGI's initial proposal and forward the draft to excelr, 
for review, this weekend and on Monday
? The proposal is due Monday PM to CMS
? Presentations to CMS by potential vendors will occur on March 26th-28th.  
We should think about who attends and at what point we might want to use our 
internal contacts to approach the client.  For now we are waiting, based on 
CGI's advice.
? Since the client is in the requirements phase, we should think about how we 
might want to support that process, given our approach to delivering systems 
solutions

Thanks for everyone's support.

Subject: Names of individuals for PRC representative and commercial staffing 
lead


Per our discussion at the Executive Committee meeting this morning, please 
identify 2 representatives for the Associate and Analyst PRC process and 1 
individual as commercial staffing lead.  The criteria for these individuals 
are as follows:

PRC Representatives
The PRC for Associates and Analysts will be conducted like the VP and MD 
process.   A committee selected by Executive Committee members will 
facilitate the process.  The Office of the Chairman believes that 
participation in the Associate and Analyst PRC should be a platform for 
exposure to election to the next level in the organization.  Consequently, 
Associate PRC representatives should be Vice Presidents who are on promotion 
track to MD and Analyst representatives should be Directors who are on 
promotion track to Vice President. 

Commercial Staffing Leads
 We need your assistance to determine accurate hiring targets to ensure that 
the talent we attract will be valued and utilized meaningfully.   The Office 
of the Chairman is ultimately holding each CEO accountable for working with 
the Program Staffing Coordinators to staff the talent and to determine the 
hiring goals.  The CEO may delegate this responsibility to a highly 
respected, interested, senior commercial person.  This responsibility should 
not be delegated to an HR representative.
Please provide the names by end of the day tomorrow,  5/9/00.  Thanks, to 
those of you who have responded.
Charlene

For the May 8th expanded staff meeting, I would like to include Kevin Heal 
(Lead, Logistics) and Dianne Seib (Sr. Specialist, Documentation) as well as 
Kathy Reeves who is currently my only direct report at the manager level.  
Kevin and Dianne provide a lot of leadership to their respective groups, and 
I think it would be very useful for them to hear what Beth has to say.  Do 
you think this will cause a problem given that you are restricting the 
Houston attendance?  Let me know your thoughts.

For the PRC meeting, I am currently planning to be in Houston June 15th and 
16th for the Global conference.  The best dates for me would be Tuesday, June 
13th or  Wednesday, June 14th, and I'll just come to Houston earlier than 
planned.  Let me know once you've finalized the date.

For the training, there are only three people in Energy Operations doing 
reviews.  The three are Kevin Heal, Kathy Reeves and me.  I don't know 
Norma's last name so would you mind forwarding this list to her.  I will talk 
to Dawn Doucet about the best way to coordinate the training.

Let me know if you have questions.

Subject: Reorganization/Promotion

We are in the process of reorganizing several functional groups within Gas 
Operations.  With this change, we want to promote Jeff Gossett to Manager 
effective May 1.  The following describes the reorganization and 
justification for the promotion.

The Risk Management, Operational Analysis, Transport Rates and Deal 
Validation groups will be realigned into four regional teams and managed by 
Business Controllers.  There will also be a centralized Controls group with 
2-3 individuals that will be managed by a different Business Controller.  
With this realignment, we are creating five new manager positions (four 
regional and one Controls) and eliminating the two manager positions for the 
Deal Validation and the Operational Analysis/Transport Rates groups.  The 
regional Business Controllers will be responsible for managing the day-to-day 
activities of their regional teams, including interacting with the Trading 
Desk Directors, and the Controls manager will work across the regional teams 
to ensure consistency and efficiency in our processes.

The new Controller positions will be filled as follows:

West - Jeff Gossett 
Central - Carrie Hollomon
East - Will Kelly (Senior Specialist)
Controls - Kathryn Cordes
Texas - TBD (Brenda Herod to hire)

We are promoting Jeff Gossett at this time due to the responsibilities he 
will be carrying in the Controller role in addition to his current 
responsibilities for the NGP&L and Benchmark functions.   

Will Kelly's performance will be evaluated during the next few months to 
determine if he will be the permanent Controller for the East region.  If he 
performs well in this role, mid-year promotion will be pursued.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I will follow-up next week to 
discuss a salary adjustment for Jeff Gossett.

Thanks,

Susan

Please note this is confidential at this point!

To document what we discussed by phone, I met with Sally Beck and Brent Price 
today.  Fernley Dyson has a vacancy that he is attempting to fill, but it may 
be 3 to 6 months before the position is up and running.  To accomplish the 
need in the meantime, Sally and Brent have agreed to share the duties as 
follows:

Brent - April 1 to June 15
Sally - June 16 to August 15

They are traveling to the UK the week of 3/20 and would like to schedule some 
time with you on either Monday afternoon or Wednesday.  Please let us know 
what is good for you. 
I have free time on the morning of the 20th. I will book out a room from 
11-12am in HR. Please let me know if this is a problem.

Issues:

Housing - They will each be bringing their families with them (Brent - spouse 
and 2 small children - the baby will need a crib; Sally - husband and 3 
children - ages 15, 11 and 2).  I understand that the houses which have been 
vacated due to returning expats have all been filled, so can you have someone 
arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them? I think the best 
way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very 
difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of 
accommodation. My assistant, Lisa, has put a call in to a service who can 
help us find serviced accommodation in South Kensington/Chelsea area or in 
Dolphin Square where we have people now who are very satisfied. Is there a 
reason you are partial to South Kensington/Chelsea? What if we find 
accommodation in another nice area of London within a short commute to the 
office? When I have some options, I will let you know, probably on Monday.

Immigration - Due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and 
have made trips already, I feel it would be best to apply for work permits 
versus using the visa waiver.  I have sent them the forms and requested that 
Brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his 
sometime shortly after he arrives in the UK.  I have informed him that he 
should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by April 
1. Brent's work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before 
April 1st, but it is unlikely. The way it works for this is as follows: Brent 
will receive the work permit from us and if he is here, he will have to leave 
the UK and enter with the work permit for it to be validated. If his family 
are in Houston, they will need to receive entry clearance in the US prior to 
arriving in the UK. This takes approx 7 working days and they will require 
either Brent's original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each 
along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates. If Brent 
decides to bring his family with him to London prior to receiving the work 
permit, they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of 
time and have a return ticket to back it up. Once the permit is received, the 
family can either travel back to Houston and submit the entry clearance visas 
there or they can all travel to Amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing 
entry clearance without a problem. There is always a small element of risk in 
going to Amsterdam, however, as do not have to issue the stamps there, they 
just do it because they are nice! Work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks 
from date of submission. We can discuss all of this on the 20th.

Tax - Please confirm whether PAYE will need to be paid for them during the 
short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit. PAYE is 
due after 60 days; however, if Brent and Sally are really only going to be 
here for approx 75 days, I am not going to inform the Revenue that they are 
here. If this extends beyond the set time, we can look at options but the 
only responsiblility that Brent and Sally will have is to ensure they 
complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back. Also, as we 
would have to apply the treaty here, we need to ensure the salary costs stay 
in Houston. Jane, have you discussed this point? 

Benefits - I have suggested that they remain on US domestic payroll and 
benefits and, if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent 
in the US, they may claim the excess on the expense report. Agreed.

Per diem - We need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size. 
Jane, please call me to discuss. I have left you a message, thanks

Let me know of any other issues we need to address.  As always, I appreciate 
your help.

we discussed.

The Australian/Pacifice role would be a fantastic opportunity. Kinda - Comm 
Supp Controller/CFO/CAO (whatever...) - basically Sally's & Rick's (C) eyes 
whilst they're asleep (Tokyo support would report into Sydney - same time 
zones). It would also have risk, control, processes & procedures 
responsibilities - working directly with Ted's group. I'll work with them and 
face the 'challenge' so to speak.

Basically - running accounting, risk & controls - and keeping the global risk 
function (headed by yourself) with a flag waving 24 hours a day - kinda 
CFO/CAO/Controller for excelr goes Global/24 hours.

The idea - 'excelrise' the junior offices - put an experienced person in there 
to 'set the standards' and the tone of operations - and train the local 
employess in the ECT way. Working closeIy with IT, RAC, Risk, Operations 
etc...

I love the idea. And I think the timing (vis Helsinki etc..) is perfect.

I think it dovetails well with the current environment of putting the right - 
experienced - people in the right places in the world to ensure that the 
standards remain high - especially with EBS starting to spread into the 
'world'.

Fernley was very supportive on the idea. I guess we would need to speak to 
Commercial people.

I also, on the London subject, spoke to Brent. I think London would benefit 
from Brent - he's a good guy. It would also allow me a shot at the new role 
in say a 2/3 month roll-out - starting in the Summer.

Let's keep talking. Let me know how (if?) you want to progress things. Hope 
Orlando was fun.

This is what CGI forwarded me this morning with regards to a potential 
partnering agreement with excelr to respond to the RFP sent out for 
development of Back-Office systems.  The idea is for us to license our 
""source-code' for the mid/back-office technology to CGI, who will then tweak 
it to build a system for their customers.  At this point in time, we have not 
made any commitments, whatsoever, and are planning to do so only if this can 
be done with minimal hand-holding from us (given our other project 
commitments).

Please read through the Teaming Agreement at your earliest so we can all 
discuss any revisions you may want made.

As CGI will be responding to this RFP today with potential support from ENW 
(i.e. our code would be one of the key selling points), they had requested 
some basic information on excelr, which we provided to them late last week.  
This will be bundled with company specific information for CGI, that will be 
provided as part of the Response to RFP.

Greg,

Two quick comments.  Mutual non-solicitation agreement will not be
accepted by excelr.  It is corporate policy not to enter into these
agreements because they are unenforceable internally (we are just too
large and recruit too many people to track them).  Certainly, we will
not use the partnership to recruit your people, but can not commit to
that in writing.

  Second, the term of the confidentiality agreement is quite long (3
years).  In the high tech world this is considered a quite long.  I
think our attorneys like to keep these shorter (again for tracking
purposes).  If we can make it 2 years and remove the mutual
non-solicitation, I will forward it.

- Steve

excelr Global Markets has experienced tremendous growth since inception and 
this growth rate will continue to increase as new businesses and markets are 
developed.  In order to ensure EGM Operations & Accounting is positioned to 
provide the highest level of support and value to each EGM business unit, I 
am pleased to announce the following organizational changes effective 
immediately.

Physical Commodity Operations
These groups, which include Crude & Products, Coal, LNG, Freight and Weather, 
are being reorganized along functional lines to provide better focus and 
promote efficiencies across these operational activities.  Weather is being 
included in this group to maintain the consistency of current Operations 
leadership in this area.

      Business Risk Controls
Todd Hall will assume the role as Business Risk Controller on a worldwide 
basis for the physical businesses.  This group will have responsibility for 
all Risk Management activities and serve as the daily commercial interface 
for all operational issues that affect the physical businesses.

North America Operations
Michelle Bruce will assume responsibility for the following activities that 
support the physical businesses for North America:  Confirmations, 
Coordination, Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Michelle and her team will 
also play a key role in coordinating operational activities as they relate to 
potential acquisitions and new business opportunities within North America.

Europe/Asia Operations
Cindy Horn will continue in her role managing the following activities for 
the physical businesses in Europe and Asia:  Confirmations, Coordination, 
Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Cindy and her team will also have the 
critical responsibility of ensuring proper controls and processes are 
maintained for all new and existing markets throughout the region.  Tiong 
Hock Lim and his team in Singapore will report to Cindy.

Financial Commodity Operations
Sheila Glover will expand her current role and manage all business risk and 
operational activities for Financial Trading and Global Risk Management.  As 
the Global Risk Management business grows, Sheila will develop the 
operational processes and infrastructure necessary to support it.

Todd, Michelle, Cindy and Sheila will also work together as a Controller team 
to ensure processes and controls are consistent across EGM and that 
efficiencies are broadly applied.

Structuring/Transaction Analysis
Scott Earnest will assume responsibility for all commodity structuring and 
transaction analysis activities across EGM.  His duties will include pricing 
and valuation of new transactions and businesses, evaluation of existing 
transactions to identify restructuring opportunities and risk controls 
monitoring and reporting.  

Technology
Kevin Sweeney will continue in his role as Technology Controller.  Kevin and 
his team will be completing the implementation of Project Thunderball for 
Crude & Products and Coal and will also serve as the Business Leads for 
system enhancements and new technology opportunities that are identified.

Financial Operations & Accounting

I have some observations to make from my reading (and re-reading) of the 
account:

1 It looks like the old ""undue influence"" problem again. It seems some 
attempts were made by operations to follow up, but nothing happened. 

We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don't 
have any way to protect them if they do - there is still the fear that if 
they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career. And that 
is because twice a year, at the PRC, that can happen. This incident shows 
some of these attributes.

For the operations process to be effective there has to be (and be seen to 
be) little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of 
the operations staff. 

2 Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm 
the basis on which they signed it.

3 Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers ? Brokerage is in 
the P&L and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage 
is at the agreed rate, they should simply pay the brokerage.

4 Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable - it should be done same 
day. I would not have waited for the traders to do it, but I would want to 
know why it took them so long.

5 Given that these (short) trades were absent from the portfolio during a 
highly volatile period of rising prices, I would wonder about motivation in 
addressing the position during this time. Essentially, if it had been correct 
we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did.

I would pursue explanations to points 2, 4 and 5.

Subject: UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors - o1.1m hit


On the 7th of June Gas Risk Management became aware that two'late' trades had 
been entered into the gas trader's 'Blue book' which were both being booked 
significantly late and had a material negative P&L impact (negative o1.1m). 
The 'late' deals were done on the 3rd of February (Marcello Romano) and the 
30th of March (Haakon Olafson) and were both forward starting sells for 
periods in 2003-2004.

Background

1) Input errors

For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal 
input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most 
significant number coming form the UK Gas traders. Numerous errors have been 
found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness 
of entering deals into the 'blue book' (the Gas traders are currently the 
only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation 
system - there is currently a big push to change this which has the support 
of John Sherriff with a deadline date of 31 July).

In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted 
booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen. A log of 
all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May 
which highlights an error rate of 12%-15% of non EOL trades. This has been 
discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expected.

2) Deal booking and reconciliation process (Non EOL trades)

Deals are initially written into the 'blue book' by the gas traders when the 
deal is done. This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are 
the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day.

Faxed broker statements are received (usually) by documentation the next day 
and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by 
documentation liasing with the traders as necessary. At this time brokers 
were faxing one statement per trade (relevant later).

3) New Deal sign off

As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is 
signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and 
the implied origination P&L. For the 3rd of February Marcello signed off the 
new deals sheet and for the 30th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed off.

4) Documentation convention

In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation. 
(relevant later). Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after 
trade booking.

5) Brokerage invoices

Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then 
reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the 
deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to 
authorise for payment. Any deals which cannot be found are raised with 
documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders.


Specific details of these 'late' trades

1) Summary

For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving, or can it be 
established that we did not receive, a broker statement which is a primary 
control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals. 

As excelr was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from 
either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade.

The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements 
in April and was completed by the 20th with the invoices falling due for 
payment on the 27th. The work practice at that time was that brokerage 
invoices (including those with non reconciling trade queries) were batched 
together and passed to the traders. This would have taken place on the 27th 
of April. Details on exactly what was said and done in the 3 weeks between 
passing these invoices to the traders for approval (although there are claims 
that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions) and when a mailed 
follow up was made on the 22nd of May are hazy. What is clear is that on the 
22nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted excelr to try to confirm their position 
which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred.

Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals 
being booked on the 6th of June.

2) Deal specifics

EES Broker - Morgan Stanley trade on 3 Feb 2000
Trader Marcello
EES Invoice date 1 March; Invoice received before 15 March as settlements 
started checking it. (Keren Perrott - settlements started on 13 March)
Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Emma Thomson)
Traders contacted  on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was sent on 22 May 
as requested by documentation to prove deal.
Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.


IEB Broker - NP trade on 30 Mar 2000
Trader Haakon
IEB invoice date 6 April; Invoice received before 27 April as settlements 
started checking it. (Keren Perrott)
Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Robert Vaughn)
Traders contacted on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was requested.
Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.



 Who was at fault and where did the control break down ?

I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but 
there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that 
can be made and drawn.

Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas trader's accuracy and 
prioritisation of booking trades. Despite numerous conversations on the 
subject very little improvement has been seen. It has now got to the stage 
where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the 
error was and who made it. This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis 
every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time 
trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to 
avoid the incidence of errors such as this. The current error rate is 12% - 
15% of non EOL trades. Documentation currently estimate that in 9 times out 
of 10 the broker or counterparty are correct.

Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to 
provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will 
eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately 
obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived. Most brokers have now 
changed but one or two still send one statement per trade. Reconciliation's 
of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced.

Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow 
up more vigorously (and by mail) errors and omissions on a more timely basis. 
There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by 
settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders. This is 
causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment.

Action Points

Trading

Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk

Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking

Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis

Trade Support

Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices

Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual 
deal statements

All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate

Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the 
broker records

Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree 
our forward position from July 2000 to September 2006 (the traded part of the 
curve)

Subject: Fundamental Operating Standards

All,

As you may be aware there has been an effort, fostered in Houston by Beth 
Apollo, to draft a set of ""Fundamental Operating Standards"".  The object of 
these standards is to set out the best practices of the Global Counterparty 
group for all locations (Houston, Calgary, London, Southern Cone).

We are seeking your input to ensure that the Standards properly reflect a 
London GCP perspective.  We - Bill Hare, James Scribner and myself - have 
compiled a draft of the Standards which is attached below.



It's important to note that the Standards detail some procedures we have 
always carried out, and some that we are working towards.  The intention of 
setting Fundamental Operating Standards is to agree on and document common 
objectives for GCP.   With this in mind, we look forward to receiving your 
comments on and suggestions for the draft.

If you have any questions please phone me on the numbers below.

risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility 
(""OBSF"") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility 
late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, 
arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the 
operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result 
of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on 
gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting 
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain 
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as 
to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and 
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage 
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting 
developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as 
to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process 
tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all 
Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 
covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand 
and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within 
the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical 
VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been 
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of 
Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements 
for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control 
staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit 
timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source 
documentation within excelr
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party 
inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will 
not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward 
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report 
signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( 
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) 
and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where 
applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or 
external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

April

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a ""Workflow"" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

Subject: Working together on the valuation model

All,

As we go forward on the next revision of the valuation model (due late next 
week or early the next for the offsite), it is important that we all 
understand and embrace some basic ground rules.  I've got some suggestions 
below and would like to hear any that you have:

In order to maintain coordination and control of the information - for the 
betterment of us all - I think we ought to give one person version control 
responsibility over the model.  This person should be advised when the model 
is updated.  Relating things like the effects on the valuation and reasons 
for the updating also seem pertinent.  Version control is critical if we are 
to maintain consistency in our approach to upper management.  

Related to this, Rahil should be made aware when the model is distributed to 
upper management (both Sally and Greg) and be given the opportunity to give 
feedback before hand.  

Just basic stuff, but if we can all agree to maintain this protocol before we 
go much further, we should be able to avoid any unnecessary complications.

Thanks,

Fred

Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT 

Subject: Re: Loss Notification - ""Structured Derivatives""  

Cassandra

As discussed with Ted, David and yourself the loss should not be looked at on 
its own as it is due to movements in two markets.

The UK power price curve shifted and the UK gas volatility curve shifted. The 
P+L break out is as follows:

UK Power delta P+L      $38MM
Spread options (Structured derivatives) gamma P+L  $(20)MM
Spread options (Structured derivatives) vega P+L  $(23)MM
UK Gas  vega P+L      $4MM

If prudency releases are stripped out I think if we allocate P+L to the 
correct books we get the following total P+Ls exluding reserve releases:

UK Power       $18MM
UK Gas        $(20)MM (Excludes reserve release of $17MM)

Therefore we only have a loss violation in UK gas. This is not trying to 
avoid the $42MM loss notification, I am only trying to represent the loss 
that reflects the true risk in the books of Europe.

Please hold off on the issue of a notification until it is decided that only 
a loss notification is issued for gas.

Rgds

Oliver

Subject: Loss Notification - ""Structured Derivatives""

Per discussion with Ted Murphy, P/L related to the Eastern spread options 
should be included in our Loss Notification monitoring in accordance with the 
Risk Management Policy.  However, my understanding is that the positions and 
VaR are captured in European Gas and UK Power, but the P/L is reported 
separately in ""Structured Derivatives"".  This reporting is perhaps further 
complicated by related prudencey being released in the line item European 
Gas.  

The 12/5 DPR reflects a ($43MM) loss in Structured Derivatives, and Oliver 
indicated this represents the market moving against our Eastern spread option 
position.  This is a Ken Lay level notification by any measurement standards, 
regardless of whether you compare it to the $7,500 VAR limit for Gas, or the 
$15,300 VaR limit for UK Power. Or even split it between them.

Chris, please include this loss in today's notification letters to Ken Lay 
and Jeff Skilling for the 5th.  Per Oliver, the loss was due to power price 
curve shift and gas volatility curve shift against the Eastern spread options.

Going forward, James, perhaps you could work with Oliver and the commercial 
team to determine a reasonable methodology to support the allocation of P/L 
and related DPR reporting  for these positions so we can continue to evaluate 
in compliance with the policy.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

success factors and the plan for the Gas and Power deliveries. 

First, the good news --- We rolled out the new Unify Financials system on 
Monday. The rollout so far is very nearly a flawless success. Only 2 small 
bugs have been identified and both were fixed within 1 day. The users in 
Houston and London have commented that the system is noticeably faster. This 
system was delivered 4 weeks ahead of the original schedule that we published 
in early January. For a project of this size and complexity, this is great 
news and bodes well for the next 2 major milestones.

We're not out of the woods yet. Our biggest and most risky rollouts are a few 
weeks away - Power and Gas. 
Even so, as we look ahead, we are very optimistic. Based on our empirical 
load testing, we believe that we can now deliver incremental performance 
increases and long-term scaleability far beyond what the legacy architecture 
would support. Reliability and stability should continue to increase beyond 
the recently improved performance we've gotten from the new legacy hardware. 

This milestone success is due to the following critical factors: 

? Strong Executive IT sponsorship and participation (Special thanks to 
Philippe Bibi, Beth Perlman, Jenny Rub, Bob McAuliffe, Richard Burchfield)
? Strong Executive User sponsorship and user participation (Special thanks to 
Sally Beck, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Sheila Glover, Cindy Horn, Peggy 
Hedstrom and Laura Scott)
? Adoption of a risk-managed delivery methodology based on detailed planning 
and a phased delivery approach
? A talented excelr delivery team with great technical skills and the 
dedication to work nearly every weekend for the last 2 months (and the next 
2) 
? Exemplary partnering between the Infrastructure, Application, DBA and User 
teams 
? Uncompromising commitments to team success from the vendors (Special thanks 
to Microsoft, Accenture, Compaq, Avenade)
? Focused project management (Special thanks to Ramesh Rao, Dale Potter, Mike 
Croucher and Jim Ogg). 


The attachment below provides a calendar of activities for everything that's 
happening between now and mid-May. Power will go live on April 23 and Gas 
will go live on May 21. The user bid-week simulation and performance tests 
for gas begin next week. As the calendar below shows, the team is fully 
occupied for the next 2 months.

Subject: New Profit Centers

Bob, 

Per our conversation -  on this past Tuesday, a group met from VM, Gas Acctg. 
and East Risk to discuss the recording of the 12 east desks and 7 central 
desks to SAP. Effective with March flow, each desks for Central and East will 
record to its own profit center in SAP (the wellhead desks and Texas were 
done in Feb.'s g/l).  According to Gas Acct., they will calculate UA for each 
of the profit centers (19 in total).  As we discussed, VM does not have the 
appropriate Unify reports or manpower to  support this level of accounting at 
this time and for this month will continue to tie UA4 out as we have in the 
past using our same reports - Gas Acct. will have to sum their side of the 
UA4 calc. to match us.  With the foresight of eventually going to profit 
center level accouting and reporting, there will need to be significant 
changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle this lower 
level of reporting.  I believe the flash is already being done at the 
different profit centers, but all the downstream groups are still performing 
their analysis at a more consolidated level.  There were discussions in the 
meeting that OA would not go to this lower level, but I am of the opinion 
that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across the 
organization - so if this is the path we take, then everyone's process will 
need to be able to handle this level of detail.  Of course, no decisions were 
made in our meeting, and as I stated, for now, VM's process will remain 
unchanged for this month.  Please let me know if you want to discuss 
further.  Thanks!

		 Subject: Treatment of HPL Bank Accounts

Dwayne and Gary,

At the request of Brian Redmond, I have prepared and am forwarding to you a 
draft of an Amendment to the Purchase and Sale Agreement that will reflect 
the agreement that the HPL Bank Accounts will be retained by excelr after the 
closing and that AEP will set up its own new HPL accounts at its preferred 
banks after closing.   It is my understanding from Mary Perkins of excelr that 
the procedures set out in the amendment were agreed to by Jana Soward of 
AEP.    Please review the enclosed and let me know if you have any 
comments.    We would like to get this one issue resolved and out of the way 
as soon as possible.  Thanks and hope you both are doing well.

This was not a replacement for any meeting.  I had intented this to be a 
working/decision making/resolution meeting
for energy ops.

I have a group of people working on various issues that are interdependent.  
This was a chance for
them to hear progress from the different areas.  We included IT because most 
of our issues are dependent
on them completing certain items before we can move ahead.

I will have Heather find a large conference room.

The meeting will start at 11:30 and hopefully be concluded by 1:30.

Location will follow on Monday.

Please pass this memo to people that should be included.

Just have them let Heather know who will be attending so she can order food.

Subject: Items Requiring Attention

Tommy-

Here are some items that we need some help from you to achieve:

   It has always been my understanding that there would be a complete
   separate instance of all required tables to run HPL's business and as a
   result we would be able to run all required excelr software to maintain
   our business independent of excelr.  We have just been told that we will
   not have access to the customer tables to add new customers and that
   this must be accomplished through excelr.  If this is true, it is not
   acceptable.  Could we please discuss?
[Yanowski, Tommy J.]  In our original proposal, when we offered up a long 
term service deal the fee structure covered us setting up a totally seperate 
environment for HPL/AEP.  It would take somewhere between $3 - $5 MM in 
hardware to duplicate our environment for HPL.  You guys came back and said 
you just wanted something for an interim time period at a lower cost.  It was 
then that we offered letting you use our applications running on our boxes 
and on the same database.  Most of our applications have enough application 
and database level security that we can keep excelr's data seperate from 
HPL/AEP's.  There are two applications, ERMS & CPR where we felt it necessary 
to create a duplicate environment due to security concerns.  Remember 
security cuts both ways and we don't want you looking at excelr's data just as 
much as you don't want excelr looking at yours.  Never the less the hardware 
to run these two applications plus setting up the terminal server environment 
plus the resource time is costing us about $500 K.  Hence the charge for set 
up costs.  There are three areas where excelr and AEP will be sharing data.  
They are in the global reference data area:

Global Common Codes:  Your codes for MMBtu and US Dollars will be the same as 
ours.

Global Facilities:  Your access to Pipeline, meter numbers and DRN Numbers 
will be the same as ours.  All of this information is public knowledge and is 
provided to us via IHS Energy who is the GISB certified provider of this 
information to the industry.  You will have the ability to update you own 
meter information.

Global Counterparties:  You will be sharing customer names and addresses such 
as those for settlements or statements with excelr.  We can identify within 
the Counterparty system who uses which address.  In that way we can filter 
the view to the business units so that they only see those customers that 
they deal with.  The process for HPL/AEP is the same that is used across 
excelr.  Our retail business units only see their customers and ENA only see 
theirs.  The reason we only have one group updating this information is 
because if EES starts doing business with someone who is already a customer 
of ENA then we wouldn't want to duplicate that customer information.  It 
helps us roll up total credit exposure across excelr for a customer.  The 
people who update this information are seperate from the rest of the business 
units and are instructed not to share any customer information even though 
most of it is public knowledge if you look up that customer on the internet.  
Let me know in detail what your concern is.  The ENA trading community will 
not know who your customers are and vice versa.  They will not know what 
addresses you use and vice versa.  There are only a few people across excelr 
who can find out this information and they are excelr Net Works employees who 
provide this service to all of excelr as well as the 3rd Party customers we 
are providing IT services for.  You will have a web interface to view your 
own customer information and to request updates or additions.

   It looks like we will need access to DCAF in order to send out
   confirmations for physical contracts executed on behalf of HPL.  Do you
   foresee any problems with this?
[Yanowski, Tommy J.]  We can provide confirms for those spot and 30 day deals 
that hit Sitara and DCAF II.  All this is set up and is ready to go.  Long 
Term and financial deals for excelr also flow into TAGG and into ERMS.  It is 
from TAGG that Long Term and Financial confirmations are generated via DCAF 
I.  I had been told that you will not be using ERMS for Forward Risk and 
would be confirming deals out of ZAINET so we did not set up a seperate TAGG 
and DCAF I environment to go with the seperate ERMS and CPR environment 
needed for Intramonth valuation.  We need to talk about this ASAP.  I need to 
understand what if anything you will be confirming out of ZAINet.  If you 
want to change your mind this late in the game and let excelr Confirm  
everyting except for financial deals then I need to know ASAP so that we can 
begin scrambling to see if we can set this up in time.  We actually have put 
in code to block generating HPL/AEP confirms that now needs to be removed.    

Also-

I extended offers to Ken Ellerman and Greg Lind yesterday with a start date
to be mutually determined and worked out between you and me.
[Yanowski, Tommy J.]  Thanks for letting me know.  Have you communicated 
anything to Dave Stadnick.  I probably need to talk to him and let him know 
how much we need him but it would be nice for me to know what he is aware of 
before I meet with him.


Kindest Regards,
Don

Thanks for our meeting last week.  Please let me know if you don't think 
we've sufficiently defined the deliverable for Business Ops.  Based on 
feedback from Louise - you and I still may not be clearly communicating yet 
as to what is required.

Specifically, AEP and excelr need to agree in writing for each Business Ops 
""process"" or function:

1. Who is going to carry out the Business Ops processes before and after 
close.
2. How control over the process will be handed over from excelr to AEP.
3. The necessary IT actions required to put the required system functionality 
in place (and who is responsible for implementing this). 

The table you developed at the end of last week (based on Bob's email) moves 
closer to this point.   As we discussed on the phone, we need to provide a 
description of the deliverables for each of the ""systems/activities"" you 
listed on the table and ensure that AEP understands (and signs off on) what 
they are responsible for.  To Anne's point, this ""sign off"" can be through a 
memo, protocol, acknowledged email, or other.  

We have been having a problem in that one part of AEP does not talk to the 
other part.  So, I would like to encapsulate and elevate the individual Bob 
Hall/Steve Jackson discussions so that all relevant levels of AEP (and excelr) 
understand what is being agreed before we close.

Each Tuesday at 4:00 we have a standing HPL Transition Coordination meeting 
to discuss the status of the deliverables from each group.   You are welcome 
to attend this meeting or the separate meeting we have now established each 
Wednesday with Bob H. and Tommy Y. to concentrate on HPL/IT/Business Ops 
matters.

Sally,  thanks for you personal attention to this.    

The quicker we close the quicker Bob can focus more of his time on Network's 
origination efforts.

Brian

Subject: HPL Sale - Energy Operations Task List

I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of 
what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  
Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term ""protocol"" 
into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the ""protocol"" is not 
anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply 
e:mails or memos between excelr and AEP with regard to any sharing of 
information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  
Operational details to be decided between excelr and AEP have been handled 
exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (excelr) 
to Steve Jackson (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally 
documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the 
original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for 
gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with excelr's treasury 
group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband 
in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an 
Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to 
that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in excelr's 
Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the 
amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition 
issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of 
you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have 
to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require 
actions by excelr will be our ""to do"" list.  Each item has a due date and we 
will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list 
or which appear in both the excelr and AEP list will be the items to which we 
will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or 
memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your 
requests earlier this week for written ""protocol"".   We will also update you 
weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and 
AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update 
on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest 
that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

 1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so 
that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and 
their status, or 

 2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a 
firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can 
incorporate that into our schedules for next week.

Subject: Canadian Outsourcing Deals

I met with Peggy Hedstrom and to some extent with Laura Scott  in Calgary 
regarding how they handle the day to day activity of their producer 
outsourcing deals.


The producer provides to EC their projected production schedule for the year 
by month by plant outlet. This information is entered into Sitara by EC on a 
single ticket with no meter information. For the prompt month EC confirms 
back to the producer their expected production volumes by point by day. This 
includes any maintenance or scheduled down time that would affect their daily 
flows. This information is contained within a Excel spreadsheet which can be 
viewed by the producer via a common network drive.

The producer communicates to EC their sales for the month and on a daily 
basis. EC enters these trades in Sitara. The Sitara position by producer is 
balanced to zero daily. The producer does not have access to Sitara.

EC acts as agent for the downstream transportation owned by producer. They 
have no diversion rights on this transport, it is utilised at the direction 
of the producer. EC nominates producers transport. All transport expense 
estimates are maintained by EC. EC is invoiced and pays the pipeline.

EC monitors estimated hourly flows from the plant outlets as provided by 
Nova. It is the responsibility of EC to inform the producer of significant 
variances in their scheduled versus estimated flows. Nova requires that 
shippers be balanced on a daily basis or face penalties if variances are out 
of tolerance. It is EC's responsibility to keep the producer out of penalty 
situations. The producer, at the direction of EC, either sells or buys on an 
intraday basis to balance their position on the pipeline. Final estimated 
flows are then downloaded by EC into the Excel spreadsheet. This final 
estimate is than used as the expected volume for the upcoming day.  And 
Sitara is updated accordingly.

At months end the spreadsheet information is transferred to an accounting 
system referred to as Solomon. Actual volumes as provided by the pipeline are 
also entered into the system for settlement. I didn't have a lot of time to 
devote to the accounting process, but I doubt ENA would take this approach.

EC utilises a single point of contact with each producer from a logistics and 
origination standpoint. Peggy said they did not hire people specifically from 
the producer/customers but did seek out people with extensive producer 
experience to assist with these customers. Peggy feels that their success is 
due in a large part to the very strong relationships they have developed with 
their customers through this point of contact approach.

It is of note that Unify is not utilised in managing these customers 
business. Peggy feels that Unify is not  designed to handle it and response 
time is too slow for their purposes given the time constraints they are 
working under on a daily basis.

As we discussed when I was in Houston I have put together a draft on 
Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval. I had a meeting arranged 
for today to go through my proposal with Ted Murphy and Tani Nath (she heads 
up research and structuring here in London) but Ted cancelled at the last 
minute (again). Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement, but before we 
can go any further we need Ted's input. He is now away for 2 1/2 weeks so 
there is going to be no further progress on this front.

In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put 
together. I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this 
stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC 
perspective. Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I 
am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at 
least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding. Others will 
also need to be consulted (and I would like to agree a list of key people 
with you) but I can't see their being any real contention. Can you ?

I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston 
(and it may well be here too) and this has been added to the outstanding 
list. I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be 
completed as part of the curve validation

Subject: Re: Intern Acceptances and Declines  

Last summer we hosted a lunch for summer interns right at the end of their 
assignments with us.  We had other UT alums attend the lunch.  Feedback from 
the summer interns was favorable.  Their key comment, though, was that it 
would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer so 
that the interns could have networked with other excelr UT alums throughout 
the summer.  Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summer?  
It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.  I will 
be glad to help in any way.  Just let me know.

Subject: Merchanting Metals Update #2

The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( 
see attached email ) was to provide  
a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage, spread and brand 
and location
a timely substantiation of 
stock on balance sheet
forward MTM 
debtors and creditor balances
OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany 
account

Despite the best efforts of IT, continuing problems with the AS400 
application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock 
reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright 
stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering 
sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - 
which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and 
forward positions to full accounting values.

Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the 
following :

I will discuss with AA the following
that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to 
data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model 
simplifications)
that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, 
AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these 
differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA 
within the audit timetable)
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my 
earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards 
) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to 
meet the above stated objectives
The signoff for additional permanent 'excelr' headcount who will 'duplicate' 
certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing 
Traffic staff
A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the 
final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400. We will continue to 
investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or 
system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe. However, 
this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and 
signoff of system p&l values with traders.
The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( 
reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and 
repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.

Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full 
reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination
an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing 
planned 23 rd review due to system issues ), requiring
full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 th
sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to 
Barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually 
created position analysis
the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our 
cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 
23 rd

I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

Subject: Merchanting Metals update

Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating 
risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility 
(""OBSF"") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility 
late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, 
arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the 
operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result 
of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on 
gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting 
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain 
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as 
to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and 
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage 
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting 
developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as 
to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process 
tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all 
Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 
covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand 
and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within 
the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical 
VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been 
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of 
Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements 
for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control 
staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit 
timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source 
documentation within excelr
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party 
inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will 
not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward 
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report 
signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( 
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) 
and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where 
applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or 
external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during 
April 

If you have any questions please call me on x34703

Mike

But I assume the invitation will be extended to all of their groups so that 
whoever they want can attend. 

I would actually prefer that the presentation is actually circulated to the 
groups on Friday rather than presented as we will wait forever on getting an 
offsite together.  How about circulating the presentation and then letting 
them refer all questions to Rahil - see how much interest you get.  One on 
ones are much better and I think this is how Rahil should proceed.  We need 
to get in front of customers in the next couple of weeks.

Let's aim to get a least three customers this quarter.

Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, 
the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue 
sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the 
DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by 
this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are 
checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch 
both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all 
origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a 
date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do 
one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas   Frank Vickers (East)
   Laura Luce (Central)
   Barry Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives  Fred LaGrasta

Power  Dave Duran
   Ozzie Pagan
   Ed Baughman
   

Portland  Chris Calger

Calgary  Ladain

Mexico  Max Y. 

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy 
and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL 
marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the 
opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with 
Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work 
for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you 
would like.  --Sally

27566,beck-s/all_documents/564.,<137761.1075849826105.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Please excuse the long e-mail below - I knew we'd never get a chance to all 
get together, and this is somewhat urgent as I have to complete the Finance 
Committee presentation for the upcoming BOD meeting by the end of next week, 
and it will include trading results for the 1st quarter, reported in 
accordance with the risk management policy.  Due to issues noted below, this 
may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to 
come up with the best quality numbers we can.  I talked to Beth already, and 
MRM met with Chris Abel's group to see if there was a short cut, but our 
joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved 
in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the 
best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the BOD.  
We'll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3/30 #s as of end of the 
day next Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.

As you recall, the February 12th BOD meeting resulted in a clarification that 
the BOD approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups 
defined, and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with 
that limit structure (management reporting can be different of course).  
Chris Abel's global energy operations group has prepared a ""RAC"" DPR that 
attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk 
management policy, so that top management and the BOD can see excelr's 
exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis.    (A)  This DPR 
will not impact actual sharing of P/L from a management reporting/business 
unit perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and 
reporting to the BOD.  But commercial management will need to review and sign 
off on the RAC DPR and monitor limits accordingly, as these limits are at an 
excelr level.

The specific trading results we need for the BOD presentation are the first 
quarter P/L and average daily VaR, by commodity group.  The first RAC DPR 
available is as of 3/30 - so while it has cumulative P/L, VaR is only as of  
3/30.  (Note - we're also comparing to 1Q 2000, but we're not going to 
attempt to resolve cross-commodity reporting for that period except at a high 
level).

Your participation is needed in resolving: 1) cross-commodity reporting per 
the new RAC DPR - both retroactively for the 1st quarter, and going forward, 
and 2) ROVAR (return on average daily VaR by commodity group) for the 1st 
quarter.  This aggregation of cross-commodity activity has been completed by 
Chris as of 3/30, so he has what he believes to be P/L aggregated for the 
quarter in accordance with the policy. What we don't have is VaR on a daily 
basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on 
3/30.  Obviously we're not going to be able to go back and calculate daily 
VaR for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner - 
especially within a week.  So it appears we'll need to ""swag"" average daily 
VaR - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3/30, by 
considering cross-commodity activity you're aware of that took place 
throughout the quarter, and using our best estimate of the impact on VaR for 
this cross commodity activity.  

Due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices, we feel a certain 
level of due diligence is required for us to  feel confident we're reporting 
to the BOD in accordance with the policy. And since we only have a few days, 
I thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt 
resolution of material issues, and then you and Chris' group can work out 
your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit.  
When you consider materiality, please involve your Market Risk contact - 
while a transaction/position/book may not be material to gas or power, it may 
be material to Global Products,  Weather, etc..

Would you please help us with the following:
? Confirm your review of Chris' aggregation on the RAC DPR at 3/30 (Chris' 
staff can walk you through)
? are all the cross-commodity positions you're aware of being reported 
correctly?
? is there other cross-commodity activity not present at 3/30 and 
consequently not aggregated for the quarter's results, but actually present 
during the first quarter and material? If so, estimate impact on P/L and 
average daily VaR.
? we're not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis - perhaps you can 
simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity 
to get a feel, and if they point on specific material transactions, we can 
address those; you can determine best approach
? are there certain books in RisktRAC that have cross-commodity positions 
imbedded/combined - either held currently or those that generated significant 
VaR or P/L during the quarter?  Going forward these will need to be reported 
separately to facilitate risk reporting, but in the next week what we need is 
an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities, or a conclusion 
that the impact is immaterial.
? Once you've reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the RAC 
DPR and per your own knowledge, help us estimate the impact on the respective 
commodities' average daily VaR for the quarter - you can discuss with your 
market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable ""swag"" approach.


After considering the information above, please provide your assessment on 
whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross-commodity 
activity, and if not, identify the issues involved and whether it is 
something that market risk needs to address, or if it will simply take more 
time to resolve the reporting details.

If you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading 
results for the quarter, please feel free to pursue those.  I do not mean to 
imply I know how to do your jobs, or that you're not doing them - I simply 
want to coordinate with you to ensure the #s we report to the BOD are the 
numbers you agree with, and that if they're not completely accurate given 
recent implementation, that we are able to articulate and estimate the 
potential misstatement, if any.  As you are the experts on your businesses' 
results, I simply wanted to make sure I closed the loop with what we in MRM 
understand regarding your reporting of the cross-commodity activity and 
trading results and the application of the policy.

On a separate note, we need you to identify P/L related to special 
transactions that flowed through the DPR, but do not really represent trading 
activity - examples in the past are SFAS 125 transactions and other unique 
gain/loss events - we're reporting 1Q 2001 and 1Q 2000, so whatever we can 
recall about last year will also be considered. We will be sending you a 
reconciliation from the DPR to the BOD package that we use to document any 
special adjustments, and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement 
on adjustments to the DPR reporting to derive true trading activity. These 
adjustments should be minimal, but we'd like your input to conclude.  


Thank you for your cooperation,

(A)  For example, North American Electricity limits represent excelr's 
consolidated NA Electricity trading activity, without regard to which 
business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds 
positions. So if Power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons, 
these gas trades need to be removed from Power VaR and P/L and combined with 
Gas' VaR and P/L, etc..  Heating oil positions held outside Global Products 
should be aggregated with Global Products; Global Products' positions in gas 
and power should be aggregated with gas and power, with corresponding 
adjustment to Global Products' results.

 I just wanted to give a status report of my meeting with Louise Kitchen 
yesterday. Four main issues were of Confirm Central were discussed: legal 
loose ends and ramifications, user interface, functionality, and future 
enhancements.

 Starting with the legal aspect Louise wanted Mark Taylor brought into the 
process. She felt his experience from EOL would be useful, and would help 
make any seams between EOL and CL disappear. I am setting up ameeting for 
early next week between Mark T., Mark G., and Alan to get this process 
rolling.
 
 The user interface Louise thought needed some work she definitely did not 
like the colors of the website. She had good comments on how to improve the 
look and feel. We will try to incorporate Louise's suggestions as quickly as 
possible. I am not to concerned about these comments since we have spent the 
last 4 weeks developing functionality and have not yet focused on this issue.

 Louise was happy with the actual functionality of the site. She actually 
said we did an excellent job.
 
 Finally, on future relases she wanted us to focus on Financial & Physical 
Power, Financial & Physiacl Gas in the U.S. She felt that this is a market 
where we could make money, where excelr has enough volume that we could really 
relieve some pain on our counterparties. Other commodities such as Liquids, 
Global Products, Metals, she felt either did not have enough voume to justify 
the business model or would take to long to integrate into CL. As far as 
additional features to the site incorpoating an importing function for CP 
data was high on the list, next was reporting confirmation statistics, 
exporting data, and finally automatching.

Take away message from the meeting was that Louise was extremely happy with 
the site and our progress to date.

Subject: Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 
employees in the excelr building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of 
the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule 
one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this 
segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees 
per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of 
operations employees):  

  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, 
settlements and EIM risk 

  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various 
products) 

  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., 
settlements and DPR           and MPR teams
  
  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), 
operational analysis

     
  37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global 
services       
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative ""newcomer"" to excelr 
Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would 
be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it 
easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for 
Merchant Asset group)
12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

Clara was there to work with Shane on some items for the London Rate & 
Currency desk.  Clara was also working with the IT person we have in London 
who is  working to improve the processes of how curves are loaded as well as 
how cash flows are received.  
In the prior weeks when Shane and I met with some of the groups, I had told 
them that Clara would be over to follow-up on some of the items.

Sheila,

I am disappointed to say that neither Mike or I were knowingly told of 
Clara's visit and she didn't introduce herself or explain what she was doing 
to either of us. She also arrived at a time when Michael Kass was on holiday. 
As a result of this I am concerned about the success of her trip and some of 
the conclusions she may have drawn.

I would therefore appreciate it if you could arrange for a summary of the 
purpose, results and conclusions that followed her week's work so that we can 
all understand what the future holds.


Thanks James

I have also asked Kathryn to perform more testing within the CL team before 
asking Kim and her team (or any other clients) to play with the changes.  
Performing significant changes overnight, and then showing the code to

To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification template 
was not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your group 
is working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with your 
request below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised 
reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until 
you are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/L 
notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesday 
should dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that should 
help.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your business 
unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.

Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation 
explanations.  These should be provided to you by the head trader of that 
commodity group.  Under the policy, that commodity group manager is 
responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the 
commodities under his responsibility, along with the head of the energy ops 
for that commodity group.  If the traders are not providing these 
explanations to you or to your counterparts (ops desk head / business unit 
controller), I'll be happy to send them an e-mail explaining their compliance 
obligation under the policy.  Why don't you talk to each of the business unit 
controllers, consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback 
(as I understand it is for Global Products, for example), and if you'd like 
me to send an e-mail to whoever you're having difficulty with, I will - just 
let me know who.  Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their 
explanations, but the problem is, they can see whether they're short or long 
and how the market moved in comparison, but it's the trader that can and 
should explain why they took a position, whether they're adjusting it based 
on the market moves, etc.. 

Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process.

Cassandra.

David and I. I have a few other suggestions on format/reporting changes as 
well.


The NA Power VaR of $51MM was not 105% over its VaR limit of $50 - that would 
have been $52.5 to require a report to Skilling, (but if we had had to report 
it, don't use ""WSCC"", try to spell out or just don't use)
UK Gas's VaR limit is not $4, it's $7.5MM
I can't tie in UK Gas' QTD and YTD P/L - shouldn't it be what's on the DPR, 
adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call 
over to that Yeo person and get the info. from them please
The 2nd item for NA Gas shouldn't be listed like that as it looks like 
another violation - the comment re: the VaR increase was mean to go at the 
bottom under RAC comments
The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg. VaR is not 100%, it's 
115% (notification requirement box)
EES had a VaR violation - $7.5 vs. 7 - that is a Skilling level violation
Let's have the ""Re:"" say ""Limit Violations and Notifications for December 5, 
2000""
Let's number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level


Veronica will call you to coordinate re-distribution.

Going forward, we need to increase our level of review for these as they're 
getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk 
management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for 
Merchant Asset group)
12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

the DPR group (to be implemented in order of priority):

Violation memos - to be prepared by 12pm by the next day for review by 
Chris.  Within two weeks of today this time should move to 10am, the goal 
that within the next 2 months certain violation prelim reporting will be done 
the evening of trading.  
Process - 8am or before DPR group to obtain understanding of violations for 
previous day of trading.  8-10 am write explanations, ensure sign-off 
obtained by trader.  10am - give violations to Chris for review. Issue 
violations as soon as group numbers are final (as a opposed to total DPR 
being final).  To be performed by Johnny Thibadeaux
Daily logs of problems - 
Late submissions - Michael/Johnny to print out log of late daily submissions 
and provide to Chris.  Chris to call business controller to let them know of 
late reporting
Listing of special problems - everyday the DPR group works on special 
problems.  Johnny & Chris to take over more of the resolution of problems (to 
free up Michael for putting the DPR tgether).  All problems and the time it 
took to work through them to be reported on a daily log provided to Chris.  
Chris to call business controller to let them know of problem
Daily prudency reporting - DPR group to start daily reporting of prudency.  
Audience to be determined (RAC wants it but I am opposed to putting it on the 
website)

Johnny is to push through these process changes.

Thanks for the message.  I believe it if fully understood by us and the 
individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the 
traders.  Are you in addition saying that your group (who has been very 
helpful in the past) will no longer help us understand the cause of 
violations/notifications?  To me, this appears contrary to a team spirit 
attitude, and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed 
earlier today.  Also, we are working toward getting the memos out earlier, 
and this is a real set back to that process.

Thoughts?

Subject: Limit Violations and Notifications Process

Shona -

To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification template 
was not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your group 
is working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with your 
request below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised 
reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until 
you are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/L 
notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesday 
should dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that should 
help.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your business 
unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.

Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation 
explanations.  These should be provided to you by the head trader of that 
commodity group.  Under the policy, that commodity group manager is 
responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the 
commodities under his responsibility, along with the head of the energy ops 
for that commodity group.  If the traders are not providing these 
explanations to you or to your counterparts (ops desk head / business unit 
controller), I'll be happy to send them an e-mail explaining their compliance 
obligation under the policy.  Why don't you talk to each of the business unit 
controllers, consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback 
(as I understand it is for Global Products, for example), and if you'd like 
me to send an e-mail to whoever you're having difficulty with, I will - just 
let me know who.  Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their 
explanations, but the problem is, they can see whether they're short or long 
and how the market moved in comparison, but it's the trader that can and 
should explain why they took a position, whether they're adjusting it based 
on the market moves, etc.. 

Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process.

Regards,
Cassandra.

Dear Cassandra,

In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us, one in 
the template itself, and some suggestions.  At your request, we have started 
to prepare this in addition to the normal word violation/notification memos 
and our other work.  As you have certain requests and requirements, it would 
be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to 
ensure it meets your requirements.

Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be.

Thanks,

Shona

I realize this has already gone out, but I see a few errors that we should 
correct  - and actually, I think we should call Skilling and Lay's (and 
Buy's) assistants (Veronica will handle this) and see if we can just hand 
deliver to them a corrected version early this morning, e-mail is OK for Ted, 
David and I. I have a few other suggestions on format/reporting changes as 
well.


The NA Power VaR of $51MM was not 105% over its VaR limit of $50 - that would 
have been $52.5 to require a report to Skilling, (but if we had had to report 
it, don't use ""WSCC"", try to spell out or just don't use)
UK Gas's VaR limit is not $4, it's $7.5MM
I can't tie in UK Gas' QTD and YTD P/L - shouldn't it be what's on the DPR, 
adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call 
over to that Yeo person and get the info. from them please
The 2nd item for NA Gas shouldn't be listed like that as it looks like 
another violation - the comment re: the VaR increase was mean to go at the 
bottom under RAC comments
The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg. VaR is not 100%, it's 
115% (notification requirement box)

RAC and Risk Ops are in this together and of course we'll continue to help in 
understanding the violations.  I recognize and sympathize with the strain 
your group is under with all the systems problems, the UK DPR  issues, the 
increased limit change and policy compliance activity, etc..  My suggestions 
were: 1) meant to streamline the process for you by making your data 
gathering process easier, 2) I was offering to ""be the bad guy"" and point out 
to the traders what we want them to do, and 3)meant to strengthen the 
effectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant of 
increasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders their 
accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits.

I think the confusion here is  violation explanations being ""validated"" by 
the traders as you indicated below, vs. ""provided"" by the traders as we 
envision.  I confirmed with Ted, the traders are accountable for providing 
the explanation.  I'm not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back 
to your efforts of getting memos out earlier.  We're suggesting the traders 
should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning, so that you 
do not have to go through all the effort as you do now, of trying to track 
people down in the afternoon and get explanations.  It should be the traders 
responsibility to get them to you, and they should be reviewing their 
positions every morning before they even begin trading., and should be able 
to easily explain why they're in violation or why they had a big loss.  
Whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail, or they 
talk to their Ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you 
- whatever you think makes sense and works for you.   I'm not trying to 
manage the process, just to help design one that makes it easier for you and 
is still effective from a risk management stand point.

At this point in this long series of e-mails, why don't we just talk face to 
face.  I can tell from your response you feel we're somehow not being team 
players, but that is not my intent at all.  I've tried to go out of my way 
the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much Market Risk values and 
appreciates your efforts.  And really, I thought I was helping by using the 
policy's influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the 
time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting.  

Perhaps a meeting with you and I and Sally would be appropriate.  We can talk 
about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with RAC's 
expectations.  I agree, we do have significant mid-office needs, and you have 
been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since I joined RAC;  
and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk 
reporting is required every day by Skilling.  We can continue to work on 
streamlining processes, but maybe we need to think about staffing in our 
respective groups and corresponding responsibilities.  I'm willing to do 
whatever is needed, and I don't think Ted is hung up on who does what 
either.  It's just that right now we're staffed with the expectation that 
Sally's group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of 
activities related to our risk management systems.


Best Regards,
Cassandra.

Subject: Re: Limit Violations and Notifications Process  

Dear Cassandra,

Thanks for the message.  I believe it if fully understood by us and the 
individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the 
traders.  Are you in addition saying that your group (who has been very 
helpful in the past) will no longer help us understand the cause of 
violations/notifications?  To me, this appears contrary to a team spirit 
attitude, and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed 
earlier today.  Also, we are working toward getting the memos out earlier, 
and this is a real set back to that process.

Thoughts?

Subject: Limit Violations and Notifications Process

Shona -

To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification template 
was not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your group 
is working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with your 
request below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised 
reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until 
you are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/L 
notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesday 
should dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that should 
help.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your business 
unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.

Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation 
explanations.  These should be provided to you by the head trader of that 
commodity group.  Under the policy, that commodity group manager is 
responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the 
commodities under his responsibility, along with the head of the energy ops 
for that commodity group.  If the traders are not providing these 
explanations to you or to your counterparts (ops desk head / business unit 
controller), I'll be happy to send them an e-mail explaining their compliance 
obligation under the policy.  Why don't you talk to each of the business unit 
controllers, consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback 
(as I understand it is for Global Products, for example), and if you'd like 
me to send an e-mail to whoever you're having difficulty with, I will - just 
let me know who.  Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their 
explanations, but the problem is, they can see whether they're short or long 
and how the market moved in comparison, but it's the trader that can and 
should explain why they took a position, whether they're adjusting it based 
on the market moves, etc.. 

Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process.

Regards,
Cassandra.

Dear Cassandra,

In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us, one in 
the template itself, and some suggestions.  At your request, we have started 
to prepare this in addition to the normal word violation/notification memos 
and our other work.  As you have certain requests and requirements, it would 
be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to 
ensure it meets your requirements.

Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be.

Thanks,

Shona

Subject: 12/5 Limit Violations and Notifications - Comments

I realize this has already gone out, but I see a few errors that we should 
correct  - and actually, I think we should call Skilling and Lay's (and 
Buy's) assistants (Veronica will handle this) and see if we can just hand 
deliver to them a corrected version early this morning, e-mail is OK for Ted, 
David and I. I have a few other suggestions on format/reporting changes as 
well.


The NA Power VaR of $51MM was not 105% over its VaR limit of $50 - that would 
have been $52.5 to require a report to Skilling, (but if we had had to report 
it, don't use ""WSCC"", try to spell out or just don't use)
UK Gas's VaR limit is not $4, it's $7.5MM
I can't tie in UK Gas' QTD and YTD P/L - shouldn't it be what's on the DPR, 
adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call 
over to that Yeo person and get the info. from them please
The 2nd item for NA Gas shouldn't be listed like that as it looks like 
another violation - the comment re: the VaR increase was mean to go at the 
bottom under RAC comments
The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg. VaR is not 100%, it's 
115% (notification requirement box)
EES had a VaR violation - $7.5 vs. 7 - that is a Skilling level violation
Let's have the ""Re:"" say ""Limit Violations and Notifications for December 5, 
2000""
Let's number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level


Veronica will call you to coordinate re-distribution.

Going forward, we need to increase our level of review for these as they're 
getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a ""Workflow"" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

Sally/Mike,

I will be in Houston the week after Christmas (12/26-12/29) and was
wondering if the two of you were going to be in the office, and if so, would
you be available for lunch? In talking with David Beck, he was going to try
to arrange a golf game (Mike, me, Richard Kimberlin and David) one of those
afternoons at Champions. If that is possible, then maybe lunch before golf
might work. If not, then I can meet you downtown when convenient. Let me
know what your schedules are like and I will plan my schedule accordingly.

Also, I need to know if I need to mail the Orange Bowl tickets to both of
you separately or just one of you. Didn't know if you are planning on going
to Miami together? I should receive the tickets in the next day or two and
will do whatever. Ought to be a fun trip, as it has definitely been awhile
since the Sooners have been to Miami.

Anyway, let me know if you are available for lunch/gold or just lunch.

Hope you all have a wonderful holiday season and most of all get to spend
time with your families!

Bob,

I spoke with Tom this morning regarding your ideas below. 

He is certainly willing to recommend that members of the Diamond Technology 
team participate on the UNIFY team to meet the goals.  In fact, we can give 
information with respect to ""who"" may be a good fit for this type of work.  
We are willing to help in any manner. . . 

The UNIFY budget would need to accept the Diamond charges for the work.  Let 
me know what you think. . .

Thanks,
Carrie

Subject: Re: ?? Re: KX/UNIFY interface schedule  

The citygate EOL business is getting even crazier. In fact the other day I 
had to respond to an LDC that is continually getting late information and is 
being told by marketers that it's excelrs fault. Bottom line is from my 
perspective I believe KX will make a big difference and we need a fully 
integrated product ASAP.  As we know resources are limited on the Unify side 
and they have some other critical items that they are being pressed to get 
done. As I review your options below it's hard to decide what we have to give 
up. I'm afraid if we don't have a fully integrated product that the customers 
might get frustrated if their waiting for excelr to do their part. Obviously 
the more ""automatic"" we make it on our side the quicker data will be made 
available.

Question? Do you have the resources that can be dedicated to the Unify team 
ASAP to work exclusively with them to get this all done? My understanding is 
you have a significant number of people available and this is in fact part of 
the project. I'm afraid if we rely solely on the Unify team to provide the 
resources we can expect significant delays. I'm sure they would be more than 
willing to accept any help you could provide them with. 

Let me know what you think, thanks - Bob Superty

Hi Ladies!

As you know, we are working with Matt Pena and Dave N. re:  KX/UNIFY 
interfaces.  Matt and Dave proposed the following order with respect to 
release functionality.  Please review and let us know if anything should be 
in a different order.  

As you can imagine, (1)  the UNIFY team will not be able to do everything at 
once AND (2) we want to start testing/using the system as soon as possible.  
You will, however have some influence in changing this order if you think it 
is appropriate.  We should target things that give you and your customer the 
biggest bang for your buck.

FYI-we will also go over this list with your managers in the demo tomorrow.

1.  UNIFY sends transport contracts to KX
2.  UNIFY sends psna's to KX
3.  UNIFY sends upstream and downstream K# to KX
4.  UNIFY receives upstream and downstream K# from KX
5.  UNIFY will ""undo"" upstream and downstream K#
6.  UNIFY will receive buy/sell (brokered) path instructions from KX
7.  UNIFY will ""undo"" buy/sell (brokered) path instructions
8.  UNIFY will receive psna's from KX
9.  UNIFY will ""undo"" psna's from KX

Thanks,
Carrie

P.S.  Could we live without #2 and #3?  This appears difficult to implement, 
and we would like to guage the cost/benefit.  

Without #2 and #3, UNIFY only sends KX transport contracts and receives all 
other data.  In other words, upstreams, downstreams, and psna's would have to 
be entered into KX for the user to see them.  They would, however, interface 
back to UNIFY once entered.  However, if entered only in UNIFY and not in KX, 
then they would not show up in KX.  Give us your thoughts. . .

currently in effect for today's business, 12/12/00: 1) see Risk Mgmt memo for 
summary of changes to policy, see Policy for summary of limits in effect 
except for Temporary Limits noted below (I sent you these same documents a 
week ago, so you're probably already familiar with them).  As you make these 
changes, I'd suggest revising the order of the commodity listings on the DPR 
to conform more closely with the management / trading responsibility 
organization structure announced November 8th (let me know if you do not have 
the e-mail from Skilling/lay with the attached org. charts.)  Also see the 
assignment of Head Traders to specific commodities below - the EWS memo below 
was approved by Greg Whalley yesterday.




So I'd suggest deleting the South America and Asia Africa subtotals and 
putting under excelr Americas and excelr Europe, respectively.

Other changes we've discussed:
removing Structured Derivatives reporting as that P/L should be aligned 
against power or gas risk limits

Other DPR Issues to address: 
The Risk Management policy requires Loss notification monitoring and 
reporting to be measured without the effect of change in prudency and without 
origination:
Reporting changes in prudency - we'd like this to be a bit more transparent, 
there's Lavorato's ""Management Book"", and Schedule C, and we're not clear 
what drives the changes, so it's more rather than less difficult to 
measure/evaluate trading results
Developing a consistent approach among commodities to report origination vs. 
trading - - - few commodity groups report origination separately, yet the 
area at the bottom of the DPR that says ""US and International Originations"" 
implies that the amounts reported above exclude origination when that in fact 
is not the case
Need to get EES and the UK to report earlier so we can see preliminary DPR 
with all risk and P/L by 8 a.m. Houston time

Temporary Limits and Discretionary VaR Allocations approved by the BOD, but 
not reflected in the Policy above:

    12/7 - 12/22  Permanent
Aggregate VaR Limit  $140 MM  $100 MM

NA Gas    $110 MM  $60 MM  ($60 permanent limit, + $15 Discretionary VaR on 
12/6 + $35 Temporary VaR)

UK Power   $20.3 MM  $15.3 MM ($15.3 limit until 1/1/01 + $5MM Temporary VaR)


Other Limit Issues - I'll let you know if these are extended or modified:
EES's $2MM of Discretionary VaR expires Friday, the 15th
After 12/22, we'll need to re-evaluate the $15MM Discretionary VaR allocated 
to NA Gas

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

attached as support or you can write on the request that the ""Payment request 
is supported by and has been reviewed against an approved contract"".  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Larry,

The ENA Accounting groups have had wires for our NYMEX and OTC margin calls 
sent back due to improper signatures.  The timely flow of these monies is a 
vital component to our trading organization.  I believe that these two items 
fall under category ""B"" of the policy memo that was distributed (see email 
below) and therefore should only require the signature of an Accounting 
Director.

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

We have a contractual obligation to our brokers and OTC counterparties to 
provide margin according to the guidelines set forth in our agreements with 
them.  These margin calls / returns of margin are monitored and amounts 
signed off on by the RAC Credit Group (Bill Bradford's area).   Backup from 
the Credit group should  be and is included with each wire.

I would appreciate your consideration of the above arguments to facilitate 
the movement of these monies on a go-forward basis.  I will call you tomorrow 
to discuss the possibility of having this change in effect for Monday Dec. 
11.  Thank you.

        Greg x35399

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a ""Workflow"" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

Subject: Re: EnPower production - Argentina Power  

Shona,
When we returned from Argentina we concluded that a proper risk management 
system needed to be implemented in order to posture the office for success. 
They have been trading there for over 2 years which is plenty of time to do 
so.  We used Enpower as a phrase meaning ""Proper Risk System"".  If there are 
real questions about the functionality of such, then that obviously begs the 
question as to why we allow someone to transact on behalf of excelr 7500 miles 
away that doesn't understand.  That being said Mike Guerrero seems perfectly 
hip to having the best platform available.  It was excelr NetWorks that said 
that they could implement a ""controlled spreadsheet environment"" that would 
have ALL the functionality of a proper risk system, including risk 
aggregation into RisktRAC, credit aggregation and tracking, option valuation, 
scalability, security and stability. I will not opine on such matters.  They 
must produce or stop transacting.

I believe they have implemented a secure spreadsheet environment in which to 
work.  I know I discussed this during a meeting with Ted and Donna a few 
months ago and we decided we could live with the change to a secure 
environment in lieu of a full EnPower implementation.  Although EnPower would 
be great to have, if commercial decides that the office does not have the 
transaction volume there is not much we can do.  

As I understand it, there are further issues with capturing the appropriate 
curve shift info from these offices in RiskTrac.  Let's discuss what we can 
do and what decisions need to be made.

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power 
volatilities and correlations

As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power 
traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option 
portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that 
the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in 
their mark.

In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light. 
Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as 
this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a 
matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you 
may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the 
deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. 

The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue 
for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at 
the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot 
use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise 
options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any 
way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the 
few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' 
piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of 
worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the 
correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) 
the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  
underlying. 

They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel 
who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most 
experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). 
This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of 
excelr's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the 
volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that 
different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value 
the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns 
over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it 
does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc 
calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike 
price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the 
forward price of the underlying itself. 

We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in 
Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start 
to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.

Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or 
gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no 
there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure 
given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what 
the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have 
Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega 
or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to 
work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like 
to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem 
(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the 
implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current 
system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we 
validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?

Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher 
volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their 
VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily 
remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol 
curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any 
testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). 
The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the 
impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.

I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing 
the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been 
covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having 
to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and 
are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies 
of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have 
not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in 
gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that 
it is not for a lack of trying.

Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived 
inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.

Shona - 

I just wanted to make sure you knew what a great job Chris does as a liason 
between your group and Market Risk Management on all the DPR and limit 
issues.  He is extremely responsive to our (MRM) inquiries and requests for 
information, and has been instrumental in helping me gather information and 
understand the DPR reporting process so that I can prepare better and more 
meaninful analyses for the BOD and for Rick Buy.  And he's been a pleasure to 
work with throughout all the changes to the notification process, and appears 
willing to embrace suggestions on how to improve risk reporting processes 
further.

Your entire group's teamwork and work ethic has enabled me to add value in my 
new position here, and while I got the opportunity to express this via PEP 
for you and Eugenio, I didn't do a review on Chris, so I wanted to make sure 
you knew.

Regards,
Cassandra.

-   The Financial Desk in North American Gas only shows values without 
exchange traded future transactions.


Notes for this Week's Report:

*   North American Gas has already increased its overall average daily EOL 
deal count by almost 1,000 trades a day since November.  There are now 
approximately 4,040 trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being 
traded on EOL.

*  The Financial Desk in North American Gas has increased its average daily 
EOL deal count by about 45% since October, from 494 to 714 deals per day in 
November.  In December, the average daily EOL deal count is up another 60%, 
from 714 to 1,141 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily EOL volume 
has increased significantly as well.

* US Power has increased its average daily EOL volume by 100% since 
November.  The average daily EOL Deal Count has increased slightly as well.

*  Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast Power has increased its average daily 
EOL volume by about 100% since November.  In addition, the average daily EOL 
deal count for these Power regions has increased by about 50% since November. 

*  Coal trades have decreased significantly from the levels seen in October.  
The total monthly EOL deal count for November was only about 23% of the total 
in October.  The total monthly EOL volume for November was only about 33% of 
the total in October.

*   LPG's has steadily increased its total monthly EOL deal count from 281 in 
September, 398 in October, 444 in November, to 181 deals already in 
December.  The total monthly EOL volume has increased similarly as well.

October.  The total monthly EOL deal count for November was down to about 220 
from a level of about 400 in October.  The total monthly EOL volume for 
November has decreased similarly as well.

*  Heating Oil Financial has had few, if any, NYMEX look-a-like trades on EOL 
over the past few months.  Out of a total of about 1,200 trades in November, 
less than 40 have been done on EOL.  Heating Oil Physical has yet to do a 
trade on EOL.

*  Kero US Financial has decreased significantly from the levels seen in 
October.  The total monthly EOL deal count for November was only about 24% of 
the total in October.  The total monthly EOL volume for November was only

Subject: timing of submitting information to Risk Controls

Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk 
management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for 
Merchant Asset group)
12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

1 cup of water
1 tsp baking soda
1 cup  of sugar
1 tsp salt
1 cup of brown sugar
lemon juice
4 large  eggs
nuts
1 bottle Vodka
2 cups of dried fruit

To be sure it is  the highest quality, pour one level cup and drink.

Repeat.

Turn on  the electric mixer. Beat one cup of butter in a large fluffy bowl.
Add one  teaspoon of sugar. Beat again. At this point it's best to make sure 
the vodka is  still OK.

Try another cup .... just in case. Turn off the  mixerer.

Break 2 leggs and add to the bowl and chuck in the cup of dried  fruit.

Pick fruit off floor.

Mix on the turner.

If the  fried druit gets stuck in the beaterers pry it loose with a  
sdrewscriver.

Sample the vodka to check for tonsisticity.

Next,  sift two cups of salt. Or something. Who giveshz a shit.

Check the  vodka.

Now shift the lemon juice and strain your nuts.

Add one  table.

Add a spoon of sugar, or somefink. Whatever you can  find.

Greash the oven and piss in the fridge.

Turn the cake tin  360 degrees and try not to fall over.

Don't forget to beat off the  turner.

Finally, throw the bowl through the window, finish the vodka and  kick the 
cat.

Fall into bed.

27720,beck-s/all_documents/738.,<14064679.1075855761882.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Whew!! Your schedule makes me tired!  I am sure that Brigeda is happy that 
you are involved in so many activities with her school - and then on the 
other hand, sometimes you wonder if they notice!  Work sounds crazy for you, 
but how nice that you will be off from December 21 until the 2nd.  

I hope that make it over the week before Christmas.  The week is kind of 
crazy for us, so I am trying to find a time that will work.  Sunday the 17th 
we are having a dessert party at our house, inviting neighbors, old Huntwick 
friends, etc.  It is for families, and Meagan and Amanda each included 4 of 
their friends in the invitiation list, along with their familities.  It will 
be multi-generational - I hope fun, as it would be a nice tradition to 
continue.  On Monday, I think that David plans to take Tyler and Amanda to 
Longview for a visit.  A commitment that Meagan and I have to sort toys at 
Northwest Assistance Ministries from 12:30 to 4:00 that day has excused us 
from the trip.  So it may be best for Meagan and me to drive over to Austin 
after 4:00 on Monday.  We could be back by the time David and company return 
to Houston on Tuesday afternoon.  Wednesday we have matinee tickets to see A 
Christmas Carol at the Alley  Theater, sans Tyler.  Thursday I am having all 
of my girls in NCL over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for 
Christmas and then we will deliver the presents.  And Friday is Tyler's 
birthday, with a 102 Dalmation theme planned (cake ordered from RJ Goodies, 
but nothing else done yet!).  So I really think that our only shot to make it 
to Austin is for Monday night, which would mean only Meagan and me.  

I talked with Mom last night and invited Dad and her to Houston for 
Christmas.  I don't really think that they will come, but if they do, I hope 
that doesn't mess up your Christmas.  They have only been here for one or two 
Christmases with us since we have had kids.  I think that Tyler at 3 this 
year will be particularly enthralled.  And next year they will have 2 
grandchildren in Austin, so it just seemed that this could be a good year for 
them to come.  She said she would think about it, and I told her that I 
wanted her to know that we would love to have them, but that it was perfectly 
okay if they decided that they did not want to come.  

How about Dad playing golf this week?  What a difference!! I am so glad that 
he is doing better.  

I hear you about Mom.  I think that a blow-up or some drama is highly 
predictable, unfortunately.  She seems to do that a lot at special occassions 
for Cara, doesn't she?  I will certainly help in any way I can.  And I will 
be very interested in the gosipy details.  

Happy baking!    I do have to make 5 batches of fudge tonight and tomorrow 
night so that I can attend a cookie exchange luncheon on Saturday armed with 
27 packages of fudge.

Subject: RE: Baby Shower


Got your message last night--sorry I missed you--must have been in the
shower.  We are all going nuts here, too.  We have a huge deadline here at
work.  But I worked most of last weekend so am ahead of the curve.  Good
thing, since I have volunteered to be Martha Stewart at many school events
this week and next.  LAst night was ""lessons and carols"" by the school
choir--with me decorating, baking, and coordinating.  Today I go to school
to make Christmas stockings with the kids--Sunday is the school Christmas
Bazaar at the Four Seasons--need to bring an item for the bake sale.  Also
need to start baking 12 gingerbread houses for Brigeda's class.    Did find
a matching mold to the smaller one we have so I can at least bake two at
once--twelve bakes is MUCH better than 24!  And then there is that dollhouse
that needs my attention by the 25!

I am totally ok with us not doing the shower.  We get credit for offering
but don't have to do anything.  Both money and time are in such short supply
for me that it works out for the best.  At work we start on a contract for
Dell in January.  The company is also going to pay for Java programming
classes for some of us (if I can nail this down then I can jump up to a
programmer level on that pay scale).  I also have a private contract job
with a needlepoint store in Memphis to setup their website.

Am somewhat concerned that Mother will have one of her dramas when Cara's
baby comes...you know she will get her feelings hurt somehow.  Not to
mention the fact that she will be sharing the grandchild with ""the most
selfish woman on earth.""  Richard and Brigeda went out to the Lowrimore farm
(they sold it and offered us all of the firewood).  Jane couldn't have been
sweeter to Brigeda--spent a lot of time with her.  Can just imagine that
""pained"" look in Mother's face at the hospital.  If you are not here may
need you to carry your cell phone so I can call for moral support--or at
least give you gossipy updates on the drama....

Are you planning to come later this month when you are off?  I'm taking off
the 21st and 22nd--they have given all of the technical production staff the
days between Christmas and New Years as comp time so I will be off until the
2nd...

Cindy

Well, she declined our kind offer, didn't she?  As busy as life is between
work and home for me right now, I can't say that it will bother me too much
to attend a shower where someone else makes the finger sandwiched and
punch!  Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.  I
noticed some at a rack at Randall's the other day... (Just kidding!)

Hope you all are doing fine.  I was on jury duty three days last week -
really interesting, but totally screwed up my schedule at work.  I have

In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us, one in 
the template itself, and some suggestions.  At your request, we have started 
to prepare this in addition to the normal word violation/notification memos 
and our other work.  As you have certain requests and requirements, it would 
be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to

Subject: 12/5 Limit Violations and Notifications - Comments

I realize this has already gone out, but I see a few errors that we should 
correct  - and actually, I think we should call Skilling and Lay's (and 
Buy's) assistants (Veronica will handle this) and see if we can just hand 
deliver to them a corrected version early this morning, e-mail is OK for Ted, 
David and I. I have a few other suggestions on format/reporting changes as 
well.


The NA Power VaR of $51MM was not 105% over its VaR limit of $50 - that would 
have been $52.5 to require a report to Skilling, (but if we had had to report 
it, don't use ""WSCC"", try to spell out or just don't use)
UK Gas's VaR limit is not $4, it's $7.5MM
I can't tie in UK Gas' QTD and YTD P/L - shouldn't it be what's on the DPR, 
adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call 
over to that Yeo person and get the info. from them please
The 2nd item for NA Gas shouldn't be listed like that as it looks like 
another violation - the comment re: the VaR increase was mean to go at the 
bottom under RAC comments
The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg. VaR is not 100%, it's 
115% (notification requirement box)
EES had a VaR violation - $7.5 vs. 7 - that is a Skilling level violation
Let's have the ""Re:"" say ""Limit Violations and Notifications for December 5, 
2000""
Let's number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level


Veronica will call you to coordinate re-distribution.

Going forward, we need to increase our level of review for these as they're 
getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the 
credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk 
are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a 
reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses 
RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key 
problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made 
by risk management groups.

differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many 
of your ba's don't. 
when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be 
officialized
market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market 
risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we 
make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.

how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk
Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized 
it does not pick the book up.
Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it 
picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are 
moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the 
previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer 
used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit 
will pick up 0 on a go forward basis.
Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.
Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the 
counterparty information has deteriorated.  excelr official counterparty names 
need to be used so they flow properly to credit.

what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data
As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions 
not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.
As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names 
are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first 
day it has 0 positions.

27724,beck-s/all_documents/743.,<16910355.1075855762095.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"As you know, exceeding this limit would require contacting the excelr Board of 
Directors.  Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.  In 
conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily 
report from Ted on component V@R.  Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston 
time) to let me know about this requirement.  Obviously, we want to meet 
Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and  complete 
as possible.  Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over 
the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be 
excluded from the first run of component V@R.  (Mike:  I assume that you are 
very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send 
to the daily 8:30 meeting.)  

I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh 
and me at 4:00 today.  Realizing that the time was very late in London, we 
tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in 
the meeting.  Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that 
Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.  

Here is the key fact to know:  It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R 
calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.  The 
Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing 
an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.   With this 
timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by 
approximately 10:00 am Houston time.  


Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R 
including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power) 
will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston 
time (10:00 am London time).  If this time frame is not met, then component 
V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.  We had hoped to discuss this with 
you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support 
and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London 
requirement for officialized books.  

The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on 
what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread 
options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.  Those V@R calculations 
that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the 
component V@R calculations.  While there are other commodities that will 
currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less 
material than the UK spread options.  Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of 
days before this is completed.  Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of 
this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.  

I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the 
UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time.  
We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.  It is 
probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and 
systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report 
earlier in the morning.  

Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or 
not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently 
meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London.    ",Non Abusive

Subject: baby shower / dates


Hi, Sal!    I've been meaning to call you for several days - but it's been a
bit of a madhouse, so I thought I might fire off an e-mail:

I don't know if you've talked with Cindy in the past few days - but, if it's
okay with you, I'd like to decline your very sweet offer of having a baby
shower.   Here's the deal:  A couple of friends had already offered to do
one - and I'm having trouble coming up with a vibrant mix of people to split
amongst two showers.
This seems to be a good decision for Cindy, too, since may be a bit short of
cash and energy right now.

However, I would LOVE for you to come to the one shower - if it's convenient
for you.  I would love for you to meet my friends, and for them to meet you!
If it doesn't work for you, I'll certainly understand - especially since you
may want to come again when baby is born.  But, if you'd like to consider
coming, I'd like to know your schedule.  We're talking about a weekend lunch
or afternoon thing I think.   In January or February, I""m available on the
following weekends:
Jan. 20
Jan. 27
Feb. 17
Feb. 24.
I think going any later than this might be cutting it close!    What I need
from you is to know which of these weekends you might be available.   The
""shower planners"" are getting eager to plan.  THANKS! -cara

Subject: Loss Notification - ""Structured Derivatives""

Per discussion with Ted Murphy, P/L related to the Eastern spread options 
should be included in our Loss Notification monitoring in accordance with the 
Risk Management Policy.  However, my understanding is that the positions and 
VaR are captured in European Gas and UK Power, but the P/L is reported 
separately in ""Structured Derivatives"".  This reporting is perhaps further 
complicated by related prudencey being released in the line item European 
Gas.  

The 12/5 DPR reflects a ($43MM) loss in Structured Derivatives, and Oliver 
indicated this represents the market moving against our Eastern spread option 
position.  This is a Ken Lay level notification by any measurement standards, 
regardless of whether you compare it to the $7,500 VAR limit for Gas, or the 
$15,300 VaR limit for UK Power. Or even split it between them.

Chris, please include this loss in today's notification letters to Ken Lay 
and Jeff Skilling for the 5th.  Per Oliver, the loss was due to power price 
curve shift and gas volatility curve shift against the Eastern spread options.

Going forward, James, perhaps you could work with Oliver and the commercial 
team to determine a reasonable methodology to support the allocation of P/L 
and related DPR reporting  for these positions so we can continue to evaluate 
in compliance with the policy.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Hi guys!

This is an employee referral which came to me from John Mackel in EES.  I've 
spoken with Todd, and though he is happy in his position with KPMG and not 
actively seeking other opportunities, he would not mind exploring 
opportunities at excelr should a good fit for his skills come up (John's been 
telling him wonderful things about excelr).  He would be particularly 
interested in a trading analyst/P&L/mid office type position.  John had 
mentioned Sally Beck's world to me and Todd mentioned the same.

If any of you do have anything in mind, please let me know.  Should any of 
you consider contacting Todd, it might be best to contact him at home.  Since 
he is happy with his current employer, he was really concerned with 
confidentiality when we spoke.  I assured him that you guys always handle 
contacting prospective candidates with a great deal of respect for their 
privacy.

I really enjoyed my conversation with Todd.  If any of you guys have openings 
which may fit his skill set, I think he'd really be worth giving a call.

Thanks!
Amy

the ETS Marketing Department.  Meetings were held with Richard Burchfield, 
Stephen Stock and Steve Nat to review the TAGG, ERMS and EnPower systems as 
possible alternatives for a risk system for ETS.  Lee Ferrell and Vernon 
Mercaldo represented the ETS commerical group.   In summary,  ETS is looking 
for a risk system that is fully integrated from Deal Capture to Billing and 
can be implemented in the 30-60 day timeframe.  They are anticipating maximum 
concurrent users of about 10 with approximately 20 deals per month.  Overall, 
it looks like the Caminus package offers ETS a faster and smoother 
implementation, does not expose us to any market affiliate violations or 
suspicions and is reasonably affordable with an estimated on-going 
maintenance costs of less than $100,000/year.  The following provides more 
details and I have attached a functional comparison.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions or further followup that I need to address.  Thanks.

Summary of Findings
Based on our discussion with Richard Burchfield and Stephen Stock, we 
rejected the possibility of using TAGG and ERMS because these applications 
are not able to handle spread options (one of the key ETS requirements).   
Richard suggested we take a look at EnPower.  This system was considered a 
closer fit and also more portable.  After closer inspection,  the EnPower 
System is not currently a  fully integrated product.  There are plans to 
integrate several of components into the product, but at this time, the 
system has interfaces to several other external applications including the 
following:

 RAC for Risk Management
 DECAF for deal confirmations
 PORTCALC/TAGG/ERMS for loading price curves and price calculations
 UNIFY for billing
 Desktop Models for Settlement
 Global Counterparty for Trading Partner and Credit

All of the above applications would have to be certified by an outside party 
to make sure that we could protect all parties regarding Market Affiliates.  
This would entail evaluating each system's current security, testing and 
possibly requiring changes to meet security requirements.  This process could 
take a significant amount of time to complete and might still constitute a 
violation of the marketing affiliate rules or would at minimum create the 
appearance of marketing affiliate violations.  We discussed this alternative 
with Drew Fossum, NNG Legal Counsel, and Drew is in concurrence with this 
opinion.  

Regarding costs, the IT team did not attempt to estimate an on-going support 
costs figure since there would be several factors to consider.  Additionally, 
there is a concern regarding how the Pipelines would achieve priority on 
getting their production problems and enhancements addressed considering the 
current demands on IT resources.

This may be better done in person.  If so, give me a call when you have time.

Here is my vision of the two worlds - excelr and Commodity Logic.



There are two basic alternatives:

If you see Commodity Logic as an independent venture, then we should build-in 
independence in our communication of deal data.  The ""Transaction Store"" does 
this.  Beth's DriveTrain project being led by John Simmons will provide 
this.  In this model, not every function/system currently performed will be 
supplanted by a Commodity Logic module.  Complete reliance on Commodity Logic 
to provide deal data needed for these systems would certainly complicate the 
integration as Commodity Logic may reside outside the firewall.   The 
systems/functions we don't think we'll outsource to Commodity Logic are: 
Trade Capture, Contracts, Valuation, Credit, and SAP functions.  
Additionally, we would like to see the development of more reporting support 
for the DPR, Operations Pricing Model, EnTelligence, and SAP Warehouse data; 
the implementation of a workflow, issue-tracking tool; and an excelr-branded 
site for Customer Information.   This vision was arrived at by asking the 
question: ""What would you never consider outsourcing, either due to 
competitive advantage, control issues, or confidentiality?""
I started shopping this vision around last week and will continue to do so 
this week to get feedback for finalization.

If the two are really one and will be managed as one going forward, then 
certainly a single deal database could suffice.  In this case, there should 
not be separately managed IT functions as redundant development efforts may 
occur and we could focus the resources on the top priorities.  Right now, 
Commodity Logic is heavily dependent upon Beth's resources to provide the 
data from the legacy systems.  The work to do these data feeds competes with 
other priorities currently underway such as Unify Performance, Alberta Open 
Access for Power, etc.  I think it is important to note that we have two 
different requirements for deal data.  One - to support Commodity Logic 
functions - is transactional and near-realtime in nature.  The second - to 
support reporting functions is probably a batch end of day process.  The 
technical design of the two would be different to meet functional and 
performance requirements.  So, in a combined world, there would still 
probably be two sources of deal data, one present on our network as separate 
messages for each deal that transactional systems build a listener to 
subscribe to and  a second source in a warehouse for reporting.

Either alternative can be approached, however organizational alignment and 
priorities might be different.  Further, if the intent is to break Commodity 
Logic off into a separate entity, then the first alternative is preferred to 
maintain arms-length independence. 

Another alternative is to consider Operations and Commodity Logic as a 
combined entity that is separate from excelr that offers systems and 
back-office services to excelr and other industry players.  I think this may 
be what Sally is envisioning.  If this is where we are headed, then some of 
Beth's resources that are directly tied to support of Operations' systems 
should be combined with Commodity Logic resources so we can have a focus on 
coordinated priorities.  I believe this alternative has the same issues as 
the first in terms of what is outsourced, e.g. becomes part of Commodity 
Logic, and what remains proprietary and confidential to excelr.

Let me know your thoughts.

I think that four weeks is a good time frame for this - we can re-evaluate at 
the end of that period as to whether or not this is still needed.  As far as 
the right time, you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest 
(global products).  They can give you the best estimate on timing.  I am 
copying them on this memo. 

When your schedule is set, I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with 
a copy of the schedule (dates, names and contact numbers).  Please send me a 
copy as well.  This IT presence on the floor during critical calculation 
times will be very much appreciated.  I understand that not only will this 
provide immediate contact when and if system issues arise, but that your team 
will be working with the book administrators on improving spreadsheet 
macros.

Sally,

I am currently working on a plan for floor support to provide a better time 
coverage. I would like to hear your suggestion. I have been thinking of 
providing floor support till 8:00 p.m. every weekday for the next 4 weeks. Do 
you want us to extend the hours to later than 8:00 p.m. and longer than 4 
weeks?

I appreciate very much your comments.

October.

*  The newly combined Central Region in North American Gas has increased its 
average daily EOL deal count about 38% since October, from 498 to 685 deals 
per day.   However, the average daily EOL volume has remained steady since 
October.

*  Southeast Power has decreased its average daily EOL deal count by over 51% 
since October.  The average daily EOL volume for Southeast Power has 
decreased significantly as well.  However, these are approximately the levels 
we had seen in prior months before October. 

*  UK Power has more than doubled its average daily EOL deal count since 
October from 8 deals to over 15 deals.  The average daily EOL volume has  
remained fairly level.
