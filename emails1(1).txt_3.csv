Subject: Stick it in your Shockmachine!



First one's free. So are the next thousand.

You know it's true: Video games are addictive. Sure, we could
trap you with a free game of Centipede, then kick up the price
after you're hooked. But that's not how shockwave.com operates.
Shockmachine -- the greatest thing since needle exchange -- is
now free; so are the classic arcade games. Who needs quarters?
Get Arcade Classics from shockwave.com, stick 'em in your
Shockmachine and then play them offline anytime you want.

Lick the Frog.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You're not getting a date this Friday night. But you don't care.
You've got a date with Frogger. This frog won't turn into a handsome
prince(ss), but it's sure to bring back great memories of hopping
through the arcade -- and this time, you can save your quarters for
laundry. Which might increase your potential for a date on Saturday.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Business Meeting or Missile Command? You Decide.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Take it offline! No, it's not a horrible meeting with your boss -
it's Missile Command. Shockmachine has a beautiful feature: you can
play without being hooked to the Internet. Grab the game from
shockwave.com, save it to your hard drive, and play offline! The
missiles are falling. Are you ready to save the world?

""I Want to Take You Higher!""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wanna get high? Here's your chance to do it at home - Shockmachine
lets you play your favorite arcade games straight from your computer.
It's a chance to crack your old high score. Get higher on Centipede -
get these bugs off me!

The '80s may not have left many good memories, but at least we still
have our Atari machines. What? You sold yours for a set of golf
clubs? Get your soul back, man! Super Breakout is alive and well and
waiting for you on Shockmachine. Now if you can just find that record
player and a Loverboy album...
http://shockwave1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H430297053X351633

Playing Arcade Classics on your Shockmachine -- the easiest way to
remember the days when you didn't have to work. If you haven't
already, get your free machine now.

The two analysts that I have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal 
Apte.
Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.
Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for 
the first 9 months.
I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent 
category.  I just don't want Vishal 
to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year.

Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

     Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.
     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal.
     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.
     According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.

Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday.
     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based
trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long.""
     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.
     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.
     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.
     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk.
     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to
$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to
$51.25 and $40.00 indices.

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said.
     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that.""
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.
     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.
     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an
ECAR trader said.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.
     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.
     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.
     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.
""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).""

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.
     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.
Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.
     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.
     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.
""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""
     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.
     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.
     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.
     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.
     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.

U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.
     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.
     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.
     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.

Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.
     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-
214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-
based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing.''
     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more
realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet
outlooks.''
     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,
down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was
a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.
     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour
with 140 megawatts exchanged.
     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours
generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the excelr network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email

Subject: Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed  

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed 
doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then 
among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large 
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which 
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 
41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story 
porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the 
front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Subject: CAISO demand reduction

Phillip et al.,

I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in 
the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. 
March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand 
over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for 
temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates 
into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as 
compared with the previous year.

Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary 
reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other 
forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making 
total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple 
more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% 
decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the 
retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it 
is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last 
year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in 
Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation 
are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of 
meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general 
economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least 
make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.

Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area 
only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC 
(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO 
portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in 
demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As 
you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum 
smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at 
least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its 
wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several 
mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are 
sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly 
how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's 
economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of 
the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I 
think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already 
realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the 
non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the 
WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 
6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.

I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you 
with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I 
hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any 
questions or need any further information.

Subject: excelr Center Garage

The excelr Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new excelr Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the excelr Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to excelr Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/excelr or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.  My only questions are:

1.  Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 
12/01.  Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the 
beginning 
     of the two week period.  What is going on?

2.  Gilbert in #27-is he just late?

I am out of the office for the rest of the week.  Have you ever seen anyone 
miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks?  I assure you this is 
unusual for me.
Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday.  Call me on my cell phone if 
you need me.

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.

9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron 
railings?

15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:

Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf 
(rentable)

What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% 
overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.

Why is profit only 4%? 

Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.

What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?

Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who 
receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?

Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage 
would only be 1.16.

Talk to you this afternoon.

Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs
 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the 
plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes 
across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for 
the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.

The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

13:18 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Cal-ISO Pays $10M To Avoid Rolling Blackouts
Wed -Sources
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator paid
about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and
still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the
state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISO's operation told
Dow Jones Newswires.
But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third
consecutive day.
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.
But that still wasn't enough juice.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as
a means of attracting additional electricity resources.
""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""
Dorinson said.
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay
Pwr Plant
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent
System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy
Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,
Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.
The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the
ISO.
The ISO manages grid reliability.
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling
blackouts.
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

Power Plants
(This article was originally published Wednesday)

   By Jessica Berthold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said
Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by
some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate
reasons.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public
Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power
plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection
of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday
morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron
Thomas said.
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives
returned Wednesday for a full inspection.

   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down
two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,
Thomas said.
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting.
""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""
Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's"" authority.
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday.
""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you
need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegy
spokesman Lynn Lednicky.
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired.
""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.

you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list
that I need further
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this

I would like to welcome Susan Scott to the West Desk and specifically to the 
Eastern Rockies trading region.  The plan is for Susan to work with me in 
moving the day trading activities from the Denver office to Houston.  Her 
specific goals will be to take over activities performed by Nicole and 
Theresa while generating EOL products with me and in my absence.

Susan is currently learning how to use EOL and Sitara.  She is also working 
on understanding the grid and the relationship between all the different 
trading points from Opal to the mid-continent.

My plan is to have Susan go to the Denver office during May bid-week (April 
22 - April 24).  I want her to be sitting with Nicole and Theresa during 
bid-week to see and learn everything they do during that time.  I will 
probably want Nicole and Theresa to come to Houston one more time to sit with 
us and the logistics team, maybe in early May.  Then, Susan and I will both 
go to Denver in late May or early June to meet industry people and to 
complete the transfer of operations to the Houston office.

We can finalize these plans early next week and make all the corresponding 
reservations.

Thank you,

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

Subject: Behind the Stage Two


FYI Western Price Survey Contacts

Cal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.

Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however.

More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

?

Sincerely,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He 
wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.  

We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to 
determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect 
work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation 
for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were 
proposing was unsupportable by the market.  

My version of a buyout is attached.

I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to 
foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  
Since their cost
and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I 
wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I 
want to respond to their offer asap.

Call me with your thoughts.

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

?

Sincerely,

George W. Richards 

President

P.S.????? Copies of contracts will be forwarded upon acceptance of buyout.

Subject:  Sagewood Phase II


George,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the 
Sagewood
Phase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted
pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 
500+
units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, 
this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to $8,868,000.

I have summarized our issues as follows:

1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:

     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment
     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR
     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475
     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417

2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit
turn over.

3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).

4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x 
debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.

5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.

6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:

     Land -                   $1,121,670
     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000
     Cash Equity              $1,419,268
     Total                    $2,955,938

7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage 
of
actual hard construction costs.

Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his 
excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the 
land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like 
to proceed and develop the property. 

 My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would 
also like to compare construction and development services between what you 
can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.  
Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to 
be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural 
work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is 
Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about 
either.

I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have
the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our
project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my
concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around
$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:

     Unit Cost, Site work, &
     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million

     Land                      1.15

     Interim Financing               .85

     Common Areas                     .80

     Total                         $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can
produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8
million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5
million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to 
discuss
alternatives.

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

Subject: Sagewood II




Phillip -

George Richards asked that I drop you a line this morning to go over some
details on the San Marcos project.

1.  First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from
Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in
the transaction.

2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) 
will
be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the
acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer
signing off on the deal.

3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers
deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as
deferred profit has been acceptable.

Thanks,

There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N
total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Phillip,

I spoke with AMF's broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement.  They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,
and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.

AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.

The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,
and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the
details to Wayne McCoy.

I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week.  I will be checking my
messages.

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is excelr accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different 
definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a 
superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third 
party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" 
fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be 
paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally 
the builders profit of 1.4 million.

Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out 
of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if 
they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition 
to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been 
in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and 
the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management 
fee is included.

George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will 
review and let you know what I think.

The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to 
the 3 out 4 approval process.

Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only 
true costs + 1.4 million.

Here is the application from SPB.  I guess they want to use the same form as 
a new loan application.  I have a call in to Lee O'Donnell to try to find out 
if there is a shorter form.  What do I need to be providing to the buyer 
according to the contract.  I was planning on bringing a copy of the survey 
and a rentroll including deposits on Monday.  Please let me know this morning 
what else I should be putting together.

Here is the 2/2 rentroll.  The total does not equal the bank deposit.  Your 
earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.

But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer to 
this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and 
send it back.

It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to 
the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the 
rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or

Phillip these are the volumes that AEC is considering selling at Opal over 
the next five years.  The structure they are looking for is a firm physical 
sale at a NYMEX related price.  There is a very good chance that they will do 
this all with one party.  We are definitely being considered as that party.  
Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few 
producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River.

What would be your bid for this gas?

This should probably be researched further.  If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject 
to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  

Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes 
if you need to.





Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and 
refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form 
to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this 
information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.

It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with 
the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  He will know what I 
mean.

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.

I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  

The key business points are:

1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

Email or call  me later today.

Subject: re: book admin for Pipe/Gas daily option book  

When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

Thanks

Lucy,

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

Phillip

The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.

Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.

1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and 
repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor 
cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on 
repairs.

2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite 
manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has 
interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager 
that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a 
management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager 
onsite.

3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you 
want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.

4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure 
this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.

My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property 
definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.


Sales Price  705,000

1st Lien   473,500

2nd Lien  225,000

Transfer fee    7,500

Cash required   14,500


NOI   100,000

1st Lien    47,292

2nd Lien   23,694

Cash flow  29,014

Cash on cash  200%


These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then 
cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the 
additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years 
for a higher price.

Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.

The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=
it=20
report on Southern California Edison:
=20
I. Cash Needs
Highlights:
SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=
plete=20
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=

and other measures.=20
Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=
.8=20
million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights:
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20
extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=

SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=

indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =
its=20
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=

issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20
various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=
 such=20
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=
=20
improvement component as follows (in millions):
Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77
Capital Improvement Costs                383
Total                                             $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=

be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=
om=20
contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=
=20
most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=
RN=20
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=
s.=20
Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=
t=20
would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=
ift=20
costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=

the TRA is overstated.

That is good news about Leander.  

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   
However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on.  

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this 
Friday.

Subject: Re: SM134  

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

Phillip:

It looks like a deal with the non gas fired QFs is iminent.  One for the gas 
generators is still quite a ways off.  

The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and reverting 
back to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give back 

I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate 
would be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any time 
soon.

I will keep you abreast of developments.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

This from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm:

RE;  Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest version 
of the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially 
complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who 
switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the 
QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December 
(and maybe earlier).

PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment. 

SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on 2/2/01.

For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's 
purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be 
resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this 
occurred today.

Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  
Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is 
dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it.

Subject: Analyst Interviews Needed - 2/15/01


	

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining excelr this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a 
big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.

Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent 
you this morning.

Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.

Date: 01/20/01 22:15

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, 
a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting,"" McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

""I was getting worried,"" he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider 
some changes.""

Subject: California Action Update 1-14-00

excelr has agreed that the key issue is to focus on solving the S-T buying 
needs.  Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the $ magnitude of the next 
few months.

TALKING POINTS:

Lot's of questions about DWR becoming the  vehicle for S-T buying and there 
is a significant legal risk for it becoming the vehicle.  WE DO NEED 
SOMETHING TO BRIDGE BEFORE WE PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS.
Huge and growing shortfall ($3.2B through March 31, 2001) 
The SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.
Bankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy

Michael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize 
a Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super 
Priority.

2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term

Sandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet 
S-T requirements of UDCs.  Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer 
to see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms.  ($3.5B by end of 
April).  Pat Boylston will develop ""public benefit"" language for options 
working with Mike Day.  He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or 
pgboylston@stoel.com.

3. Get Team to Sacramento

Get with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen).  Explain the 
magnitude of the problem.  Get Mike Day to help draft language.  

4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts

Steve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or 
thougths.  Probably of limited value.

5. Update List

Any new information on this should be communicated to the following people as 
soon as possible.  These people should update their respective business units.

Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that the
construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our
standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.

Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.

It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.

I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are
$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3
bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached
garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There 
are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need

That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional comments/suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of 
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

 I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I 
described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in 
San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a 
couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like 
to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not 
require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to 
structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has 
been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the 
equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this 
nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to 
permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be 
important to banks.

Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I 
have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out 
tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility 
connections?  Other rezoning costs?  

What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.

 I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated.  
  
  The critical information is  1.  Move in or lease start date
      2.  Lease expiration date
      3.  Rent
      4.  Deposit 
  
  If you have the info you can
  fill in these items  1.  Number of occupants
      2.  Workplace
      

  All the new leases should be the long form.



 The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated 
back in October are  #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38.
  

 I really need to get this by tomorrow.  Please use the rentroll_1215 file to 
input the correct information on all these tenants.  And email it to me

applications.

For the rentroll for 12/08 here are my questions:

 #23 & #24 did not pay.  Just late or moving?

 #11  Looks like she is caught up.  When is she due again?

Phillip -- Is the value axis on Sheet 2 of the ""socalprices"" spread sheet 
supposed to be in $?  If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where 
did they come from?  I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet.

As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our 
comments today along with a cover letter.  We have to fully understand the 
charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today.  It's much 
better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the 
whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track.

Thanks.

the actual anticipated online date is May 2003.
 
The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have 
access to in the WSCC:

 1) CA - siting office, plant contacts
 2) PNW - siting offices, plant contacts
 3) DSW - plant contacts, 1 siting office for Maricopa County Arizona.
 4) Colorado - Integrated Resource Plan

If anyone has additional information regarding new generation in the Desert 
Southwest or Colorado, such as plant phone numbers or contacts, I would 
greatly appreciate receiving this contact information.

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Phillip,

It looks as though we have most of the interim hardware upgrades in the 
building now, although we are still expecting a couple of components to 
arrive on Monday.

The Unix Team / DBA Team and Applications team expect to have a working test 
server environment on Tuesday. If anything changes, I'll let you know.

best regards

Steve Stock

We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >40000 equals $250 
to a 41.67 heat rate.  We applied forward gas prices to historical loads.  I 
guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year.  
Prices seem low.  Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on 
Nov 99 loads and current gas prices.  What about a forecast for this November 
loads.

Let me know what you think.

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

 Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy 
Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this 
time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.  
She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

 Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. 
specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know 
what is an acceptable cash amount.

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti 
was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.

or the quarter reflected the challenges presented as the telecom industry a=
djusted to new levels of spending,"" said John Roth, president and chief exe=
cutive officer Nortel Networks. ""Our bottom line results reflected the impa=
ct of actions we have taken to adjust to the new business levels. During th=
e third quarter of 2001, Nortel Networks continued to aggressively implemen=
t its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. The=
 Company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive b=
reak even at a quarterly revenue level well below US$4 billion. The structu=
re is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002.""   Frank Dunn, =
the Company's new president and chief executive officer effective November =
1, 2001, said, ""Nortel Networks is focusing its investments and its organiz=
ation to drive continued leadership across three businesses: Metro Networks=
, which encompasses metro optical networking, IP networking, IP services an=
d voice over IP solutions for service providers and enterprises; Wireless N=
etworks; and Optical Long Haul Networks. In the quarter, our product progra=
ms continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading p=
ortfolio of solutions. We also continued to work with our customers to help=
 them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reduct=
ions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of oppor=
tunities for new revenue streams. Some key milestones over the past 120 day=

to have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion o=
f its work plan. Notifications to employees impacted by workforce reduction=
s are expected to be substantially completed by the end of October 2001. A =
workforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quart=
er of 2001. Over the next few quarters, the Company also expects to continu=
e to divest non-core businesses in accordance with its work plan. The numbe=
r of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity (including=
 the impact of divestures announced or completed to date) is expected to ul=
timately approach 10,000 positions.   Commenting on cash management in the =
quarter, Frank Dunn said, ""We are extremely pleased with the results that h=
ave been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a signifi=
cant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operatio=
ns. In addition, the Company further increased its financial flexibility by=
 completing a highly successful US$1.8 billion convertible debt issue which=
, combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operati=
ons and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhan=
ced our strong liquidity position. Given the industry correction and action=
s we have taken over the last two quarters, Nortel Networks balance sheet i=
s well positioned.""   ""While we believe we are beginning to see early indic=
ations that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainabl=

ncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wa=
ke of the September 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and bu=
sinesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth qua=
rter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time,"" concluded Dunn.         R=
evenue Breakdown from Continuing Operations    Network Infrastructure reven=
ues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third=
 quarter of 2000. Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada =
and slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline =
in Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Eu=
rope. Optical Inter-city revenues were down sharply in the United States, E=
urope and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia. Local Internet=
 revenues were down substantially in the United States, Europe, Canada and =
Latin America, which were minimally offset by an increase in Asia.   Photon=
ic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter co=
mpared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was l=
argely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Inter-cit=
y solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000.   Other revenues decline=

nses    Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses in the third =
quarter of 2001 were US$1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market ad=
justments and further decline in some of our of customers' financial condit=
ion resulted in incremental provisions of US$767 million in the quarter rel=
ated to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental prov=
isions in both periods, SG?expenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared =
to second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US$190 million.   Res=
earch and development (""R&D"") expenses were US$808 million in the third qua=
rter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments t=
o drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the eliminat=

 R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US$100=

Earlier this week, excelr Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the excelr Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@excelr.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@excelr.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to excelr.Messaging.Administration@excelr.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



excelr Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@excelr.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@excelr.com, name@ect.excelr.com, name@ei.excelr.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every excelr employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@excelr.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@excelr.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @excelr.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@excelr.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@excelr.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to excelr.messaging.administration@excelr.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

4647,allen-p/deleted_items/103.,<31706076.1075858632278.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for excelr.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).
	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).
	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).

All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray

To remain consistent with excelr's directive to improve security access to the building, all excelr Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an excelr Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your excelr Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

I want to thank you for spending so much time with us today; I think we are
getting to a good level of detail and we accomplished a lot today. I left a
message for Ed and asked him to just focus on one or two difficult problems
because we are planning to also include some of your ""easy"" problems in the
simulation.

We will look forward to getting the outlines for the remaining four
scenarios from you early next week. Please let us know if something comes
up and you don't think you'll be able to work on them.

We'll call Ina with the room for next Friday. Thanks again for all your
help, and have a great weekend.

MEET THE DARK SIDE OF WINDOWS XP

    While I really like Microsoft's new operating
         system, there are still some issues that may
         make it impossible for you to upgrade. And
         other issues may make you want to skip XP entirely.
         Here are a dozen potential roadblocks to consider--don't
         upgrade before you read this!

  WHY MS'S PASSWORD-REVEALING GLITCH SHOULD WORRY YOU

   The use of beta software to build an MS page

  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I=
 start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Te=
rry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce =
Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answe=
r - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agai=
nst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a=
nd three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously=
 not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have t=
o go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so =
going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To a=
nswer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol=
ina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but=
 Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at=
 best, so our hands are tied.  =09


  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=
is week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=
e. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=
ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be =
facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=
 like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=
ig game.  =09


  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shan=
non Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=
ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=
ailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i=
n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=
rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=
ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =
current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not =
good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=
 will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=
other No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=
ntasy player.  =09


    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start =
giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=
n the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=
fter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes=
 will continue to be a productive player all season.   =09

Indigestion 
Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 

All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.
For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. 

Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. 

Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. 

Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. 

 
Addressing a Burning Issue 
If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.  
  

WINNERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks 
Calpine 				$4.6 		Its gas power plants won't compete with coal for years 
Chesapeake Energy 		0.9 		Hedged gas production through December 2003

*Latest 12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. 

""It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It's our game to displace older gas."" 

Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. 

That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. 

But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. 

Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.

ire via COMTEX/ -- American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) today reported thir=
d quarter net income of $298 million, down 60 percent from $737 million in =
the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p=
ercent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio=
n, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on e=
quity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively aff=
ected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge=
 of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the =
September 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in c=
ertain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisio=
ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i=
nsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination =
of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after=
-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since=
 September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl=
y, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost=
 of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th=
e company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery =
expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra =
operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat=
ed. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses=
 will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge inc=
ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a=
sset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor=
ganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i=
n certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio=
ns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr=
ocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec=
ted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por=
tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=
f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=
ted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=
ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress=
 on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=
r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =
  Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=
time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =
19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce=
nt. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   ""While we w=
ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=
rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =
we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=
estment activity slowed after September 11th,"" said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch=
airman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. ""In light of =
the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower=
 our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in=
itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business=
es with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be=
nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=
hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in=
 the economy.""   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=
e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a=
 year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127=
 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include=
d in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=
e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=
tacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income =
would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=
ear.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=
ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =
28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=
ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=
e September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=
r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=
et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=
arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=
lds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=
uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=
.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =
higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=
ncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=
in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating=
 expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=
ss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=
ing and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results ""=
on a managed basis"" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=
ich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=
lts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=
rmats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of=
 $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=
illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=
se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and=
 therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   Americ=
an Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 =

 Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $=
62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note=
d earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim=
s directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net inc=
ome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA re=
sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on =
the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly =
lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man=
agement and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, exclud=
ing the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due=
 primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-=
control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the=
 company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit=
ies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct=
ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo=
lio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) repo=
rted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i=
ncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax=
 ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi=
ng these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximate=
ly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB s=
ustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks=
, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co=

as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi=

    SUN, MICROSOFT AND THE ROAD TO THE 'FRICTION-FREE ECONOMY'

    The Internet and World Wide Web gave
    birth to an idea--a hyperefficient
    economy that operates less like a heat-producing
    mechanical engine and more like a motor
    coiled with a superconductor. To understand
    this basic idea is to understand Sun,
    Microsoft and their dueling ambitions
    for Web services.

  WHY INTEL COULDN'T MAKE ITS CONSUMER ELECTRONICS FLY

   Long the king of PC microprocessors, Intel
         thought it could rule the world of consumer
         electronics, too. Not so. Josh and John find
         Intel's decision to abandon consumer products
         disappointing, but not surprising.

Jeff:

I talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in 
having our class build a shed for you.  We pretty much make whatever you 
would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are 
durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner 
is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only 
charged for the materials.

Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most 
economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a 
given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar 
style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have 
usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening.  I would think that 
would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your 
dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold 
over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually 
varies between $800 and $900.



Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is 
a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum 
soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe 
Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize 
and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your 
dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.
The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently 
building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up 
door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be 
roughly $1500.


We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your 
needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the 
easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday 
October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to 
finish that one on time.

If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:
	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364
	My Home number 715-985-3063.

Have a good one and take with you later.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

Why is there a PG&E Citygate position in Mgmt-West?  Were these positions created in the last week or so?  Can you print a forwards detail and move these deals into FT-PGE?  Do not just transfer at mid market.  Please move the deals.

its profitability target.

Compaq swung to a wider-than-expected loss in the third quarter on a 33%

BUSINESS ALERT
from The Wall Street Journal


October 24, 2001

AMR Corp. reported a third-quarter loss of $414 million, its largest
quarterly shortfall ever, blaming the ""disastrous financial effects"" of the
terrorist attacks and the continuing weakness of the economy.

Meanwhile, Sears, Roebuck and Co. said it will cut about 4,900 jobs in a
broad restructuring plan, as the retailer reported a 5.8% profit drop.

Eastman Kodak Co. announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs while reporting a 77%
decline in net and warning that fourth-quarter results may miss analysts'
estimates.

WINDOWS XP URBAN LEGENDS AND MYTHS--DEBUNKED!

    As the clamor about Windows XP grows--it's
         being officially launched tomorrow--so
         does the confusion. I'll take a look at the
         most common misconceptions and questions
         about licensing, authorization, and compatibility
         and give you some answers.

    HOW WIN XP MARKS THE END OF THE PC'S PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE

    The debut of Windows XP could stand as
    an occasion more momentous than Microsoft
    itself anticipated. Reason: At the
    same time we're saying hello to the new
    OS, we could be saying goodbye to the
    Microsoft-Intel duopoly.

  WINDOWS XP JUST DOESN'T CUT IT IN THE SECURITY DEPARTMENT

   Like those cheesy all-in-one stereos from
         the '70s, the components in Windows XP are
         inferior to their standalone counterparts--especially
         when it comes to security. Robert points out
         the OS's security weaknesses, and tells you
         how to safeguard your computer.

  APPLE JUMPS INTO THE MP3 GAME--AND DOES IT RIGHT

   The just-unveiled iPod may have the distinction
         of being the first portable MP3 player to make
         the most of the genre. Stephan Somogyi investigates
         why this Mac peripheral might be worth a good
         long look (and listen).

All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley

Please review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable.

Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt

In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc

	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:
?	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)
?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)
?	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)

Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. 


Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. 

Thanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.

Cheers
Kirk

I received your phone message.  Thanks for the update.  I have been talking
with contractors and Spring Valley.  At this point we are trying to
determine whether the addition over the garage would be workable.  Heather
probably told you that I am meeting with a contractor on 11/7 at your home
to get a firm bid on the project.  I spoke today with the Spring Valley
building consultant and faxed him some detail.  There are a couple of
possible problems he is looking at and we'll possibly need to get a variance
from the decision makers when the time comes.

In the meantime, I printed out the earnest money contract and sellers
disclosure forms from the website you found.  We are waiting on the final
word from Spring Valley to move ahead.  I'll let you know when we have some
new information.

Thanks,

Bob Huntley

Bob,

I do have a survey of the sight at home.  I will get you a copy tomorrow.

Regarding contracts, the Texas Real Estate Commission website has copies of
the contracts we need.  The website is below.  I believe the relevant
contracts are form #20-4(One to Four Family Residential Contract) and form
#OP-H (Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition).  A coworker is about to
close on a home without using a broker and these are the forms he used.

I

     I forgot to ask if you have a recent survey of the  lot from when you
     closed?  I would like to see if we'll have any easement  problems
     above or around the garage area to consider.

THE 10 TOP THINGS YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT WIN XP

    Reams have been written about XP. I've gone
         on and on about it myself. But now it's officially
         here, what's left to say? Not much, but just
         this: A list of the few features and issues
         that really, really matter.

    XP: PHOOEY ON YOUIE! WHY IPOD IS THE APPLE OF OUR EYES TODAY

    Apple poured some precipitation on
    Microsoft's XP-week parade by introducing
    its new MP3 player. But the iPod isn't
    just some mischief at Microsoft's expense.
    Instead, it's a product that embodies
    Apple at its very best and makes you wonder:
    Is Apple underestimating itself by
    not making more things for the rest of
    us?

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as excelr's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of excelr.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of excelr Industrial Markets. He joined excelr in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for excelr's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for excelr Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of excelr Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Non Abusive

The Social Security and Medicare tax has been previously withheld on your deferral.  You would be subject to only Federal Income Tax withholding on the distribution.  I checked with my director (Pam Butler) on your question about recouping taxes already paid.  It is my understanding that you cannot recoup these taxes.

Thanks,

Renee

Renee,

Thank you for the forms.  I am trying to estimate my tax obligation.  It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income.  What about Social Security and Medicare taxes?  I thought those were already deducted.  Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made.  On the contrary, there are losses.  Is it possible to recoup any taxes paid?

Thanks for you help.

Phillip

GRAB A SEAT, AND JOIN ME FOR MY DINNER WITH BILL GATES

    On the eve of Windows XP's launch, I joined
         14 other journalists for a private dinner
         with the chairman and chief software architect
         of Microsoft.  We had one thing in common: When
         Bill talks, we write about it. And on this night
         he was talking, and just to us. Here's part
         one of what Bill had to say.

    WILL THE PATRIOT ANTI-TERRORIST BILL BETRAY US?

    A new anti-terrorism law, which significantly
    expands law enforcement powers, is
    speeding into law. So now we'll see:
    Whether Congress, with our assent,
    acted wisely or whether we allowed fear
    to lead us astray.

  SERIOUS ABOUT SECURITY? BETTER DOUBLE YOUR OPTIONS

   Think user IDs and passwords are adequate?
         Think again. Those single-factor security
         systems are quite vulnerable. Add a second
         element, such as an ID card, and the solution's

2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-excelr or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-excelr (800-973-6766) to reach excelr's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-excelr from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-excelr.

Good day. I hope all is going well. 

If I do not hear from you by COB tomorrow I will take your silence as acceptance and that their are no non-conformities to prevent acceptance of this deliverable. In addition, this includes the condition of what we can change for the two week period following acceptance (see below). This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable. 

Good news is that this deliverable and the Topic Framework deliverable are the last two deliverables for the Design Phase of the project. Thanks

Cheers

Subject:	Revised High Level Design-Sign-off for Acceptance

Phillip/Tim/Yevgeny
Please review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable.

Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt

In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc

	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:
?	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)
?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)
?	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)

Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. 


Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. 

Thanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.

Cheers
Kirk

Philip,

What is going on down the street?  Curious to hear any perspectives you may
wish to offer from the trading floor?  excelr stock is now lower than when I
joined the company out of business school.  I imagine there are quite a few
not so happy people these days.  We can relate somewhat over here at NPW
with a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago).  Knowing
you, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you down
much.  I have taken a similar approach to our problems here at NPW.

Hope everything else is going well for you and the family.  Have you had
the knee surgery yet?  Give me a call when you have a chance.

Later,

JOIN ME FOR MY DINNER WITH BILL GATES, PART 2: THE Q&A

    When I and 14 other journalists joined Microsoft's
         chairman for a private dinner after the Windows
         XP launch, he had a lot to say. In the second
         installment of this two-part story, Bill
         speaks out on XP's controversial activation
         technology, the company's upcoming tablet
         PC, wireless standards, and more.

    SEND IN THE REBATES! APPLE HOPING TO BOOST INTEREST IN IMACS

    Apple is hardly immune from the slowdown
    in hardware sales--and now we're seeing
    the rebates to prove it. The company
    is giving cash back--or free toys--to
    anyone who buys its computers from now
    through December, borrowing a tactic
    from its PC-selling brethren. But is
    it too little, too late?

  WHERE'S THE BEEF? AUDIENCES TIRED OF CEOS' EMPTY
  RHETORIC

   At a recent tech conference, Microsoft's
         Steve Ballmer and Sun's Scott McNealy played
         up the jokes, while HP's Carly Fiorina stuck
         to business. Can you guess who won the crowd's
         favor? David finds out that technology execs
         crave substance, not style.

  HOW CITRIX IS SHAKING OFF WORRIES OF A MICROSOFT
  INVASION

   Despite talk that Microsoft will encroach
         on its turf, software maker Citrix continues
         to deliver strong results. What's its secret?
         Larry explains why Citrix is one of the few
         companies that has been able to dance successfully
         with this 800-pound gorilla.

  NO THANKS, BILL. TRY 3 NON-MICROSOFT WAYS TO MANAGE
  PASSWORDS

   Sure, it's a pain trying to remember your username
         and password for the numerous Web sites you
         visit each day, but Microsoft's new Passport
         service is not the only solution. Preston
         digs up three programs that store and manage
         passwords--with no involvement from Redmond.

We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	


  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	


  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	


    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

In addition, the  supply of stock for sale at prices just above current lev=

GDP growth in 2002 by only 0.2%. Without fiscal stimulus, the  chances of a=

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

I will need to close the loan at the title company in Hays County this week.
If you elect me vice-president of Bishops Corner, Inc., I can take care of

         is traditionally vacation time in Silicon

         In the meantime, here are some places you can

    HO, HO, HO! WHY CHRISTMAS 2002 WILL BE JOLLY, BY GOLLY

    While this is a muted Christmas for most
    of us, it's been a merry one indeed for
    e-tailers. Pat thinks that if this holiday
    generated so much holiday cheer, just
    wait 'til next year. That's when some
    enabling technologies will make online
    shopping far more than the glorified
    catalog-buying experience it is now.

  WHY YOU'RE STILL NOT GIVING CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY WANT

   The Internet promised to make ""mass customization""
         a reality. But so far it hasn't worked out that
         well. Reason: It's simply too costly. But
         is there some way your business can create
         tailor-made goods for even broad markets?
         Adrian thinks so--but it's going to be tricky.

  BUILDING AN E-GOVERNMENT: IT'LL BE HARD, BUT IT'LL HELP IT

   Will the government ever go paperless? It
         looks like in 2002 it might start. Such an undertaking
         would boost government spending and give
         tech businesses a much-needed shot in the
         arm. But it won't be easy. Larry explains why
         it'll be so challenging to bring the government
         into the wired world.

WILL HACKERS MAKE A FOOL OF LARRY ELLISON?

    Larry says his company's new e-mail server--intended
         to replace Microsoft Exchange--is ""unbreakable.""
         But is anything bulletproof if the bad guys
         really want to bring it down? I don't think
         so. But never mind me. If the bad guys don't
         think so, Larry's bravado could be setting
         up his company and his customers for hardship
         and humiliation.

We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To excelr Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:excelr.Center.South.Technology@excelr.com",Non Abusive

  November 16, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

10 COMDEX PRODUCTS YOU NEED TO SEE (AND CAN)

    I couldn't possibly do justice to all the things
         I saw at Comdex in the 600 words that make up
         my column. But since pictures are worth a thousand
         words--and video even more--I'm still able
         to give you a good glimpse of 10 products that
         are well worth watching.

being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:

		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks

excelr has allowed this program to be hosted in the excelr Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from excelr is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",

the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested excelr employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

but that might still be possible.  Anyway, let's see what happens with the
variance.  I appreciate your efforts.

By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors?

Bob,

I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be
on January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing,
the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression
that yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.

On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful
suggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition
forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new
space.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use
the new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the
existing play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that
is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be
used for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would
not have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the
playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you could
slope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place a
large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.
>From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your
drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below
the addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the
driveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the house
so that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen
to the living room or dining room would still be possible.  Personally, I
think opening the dining room would be the better idea.

I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in
exploring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest
something in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me
to try and sketch out these ideas.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as excelr employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-excelr holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for excelr to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

HOW TO PICK AN ALL-IN-ONE: IT'S THE FORM FACTOR, STUPID

    I'll say it straight up: There's no perfect
         device (yet) that combines a cellular phone
         and a PDA. So finding one you can live with is
         always a trade-off. My advice? Choose form
         factor first and live with the compromises.
         (Or just stick with separate gadgets.)

    APPLE: BRING ON XP... HP'S SPEED BOOST... PENTAGON GOING
PRIVATE...

    Might you Windows users come back to
    the Mac? Apple thinks so. It's confident
    its new OS X out-XPs Microsoft XP--enough
    to entice more than few converts into
    the Mac fold. But will it work?

  CAN YOUR BIZ PASS A SECURITY AUDIT? HERE'S WHY IT
  MUST

   A recent review of government computing showed
         its security was sorely lacking. What about
         at your company? The nation has paid ample
         lip service to the importance of tight security,
         now it's time to act. Wayne tells you how.

    SONY ON DVD FENCE... NEW LOOK FOR LINUX... MS SERVERS
ATTACKED...

    The battle over which DVD format will
    become the industry standard wages
    on. Sony's weighed in on which one it
    prefers, but its stance is hardly decisive.
    Also, a new graphical interface for
    Linux and other Unix-like OS's has arrived,
    and a worm is wreaking havoc on Microsoft
    SQL servers.

Lee Schlesinger

  WHY A 'PATCHWORK' APPROACH TO SECURITY IS RIGHT
  FOR YOUR BIZ

   If you're concerned about keeping your network
         safe from hackers, crackers, and worms, there's
         an easy way to do it: stay up to date with patches.
         But most organizations don't have a patchwork
         plan. Lee Schlesinger explains why that's
         important--and shows you how to take the right
         approach.

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

UNLUCKY 13: MY TOP TECH TURKEYS OF ALL TIME

    It is sad that a fowl so noble--not to mention

    GET READY TO SHOP... MS'S NEUKOM DEPARTS... FBI LISTENING IN...

    It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas...well,
    at least in the shopping malls, and probably
    at your favorite online stores, too.
    This holiday season, the biggest retail
    names are putting extra effort into
    making their online shops as good as
    their offline ones--and, unlike past
    years, in making your experience there
    as pleasurable as possible.

   Which technologies will matter most in the

   If you fumble with your PDA every time you make

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in excelr's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - excelr has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  excelr will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - excelr's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

   Malicious users are learning to better outsmart

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,

Mike & Tony,

Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  

I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.

We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.  

I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.

David,

For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.

Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.

Phillip

For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.

Kirk -

In regards to your response to move these reviews up and hopes to get the
ball rolling before Monday, November 26th - I will be sending you three
messages following this with the drafts of five topics that are ready for
SME review.
1) Options and Futures for Dutch Quigley
2) Forwards and Swaps for Andy Lewis
3) Organizational Structure for Berney Aucoin

I hope sending them in this manner will make it easier for you send to
Phillip and ultimately, the SMEs.

Our goal is to send you the following topics by EOD tomorrow:
1) Risk Identification and Commodity Fundamentals for Ed McMichael
2) Risk Management Inputs and Hedging Basics for Mark Reese

Reminder that Accounting & Reporting will be written by Errol McLaughlin
(from Jeff Gossett's group) and will not be complete until mid-December.

As far as storyline scripts are concerned, I am unable to send anything to
you prior to the EOD tomorrow. Unfortunately, our script writer can not get
them to us any sooner. Hopefully you can forward them to Legal for them to
see first thing Monday morning. I apologize for not being able to get them
to you sooner.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Good afternoon Kirk -

As a reminder, the following are upcoming reviews we will need from excelr.

**Scripts for Storyline Video:  These scripts will be ready for excelr Legal
to review first thing Monday morning after the holidays - Nov. 26th. Based
on our production shoot schedule and reserving the actors/actresses, we
would like these reviews completed by EOD Wednesday, but can have them no
later than EOD Thursday.  As I've mentioned before, these scripts should
not take more than two hours to review. Please let me know if there are any
issues with this timeframe as it will significantly impact our schedule as
well as the production house and hired actors/actresses' schedules. Thank
you.

Topic Content for the Knowledge System: We will have all but one of the
topics ready for SME review/edits first thing Monday morning - Nov. 26th.
As we discussed, I am hoping you can send these to Phillip for him to
forward on to the SMEs. We will be sending these topics to the following
SMEs for their review and edits.
     Risk Identification - Ed McMichael
     Commodity Fundamentals - Ed McMichael (waiting on one homework
assignment from him)
     Futures - Dutch Quigley
     Options - Dutch Quigley
     Swaps - Andy Lewis
     Forwards - Andy Lewis
     Risk Management Inputs - Mark Reese
     Hedging Basics - Mark Reese
     Organization Structure - Berney Aucoin (we are still missing content
for Mid-Marketer/Origination)

The last topic, Accounting and Reporting, will be developed later in the
process as Errol McLaughlin will be helping us write this througout the
first two weeks in December. Berney Aucoin will need to review this.

     Phillip,

     Thank you for meeting with us today. I want to take a few minutes to
     summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.

     1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions
     you
     gave us and move forward with this approach.

     2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for
     Topics
     reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for
     sign-off on each topic.

     3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to
     incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We
     will
     meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've
     designed them so far and arrive at a solution. (I will send an e-mail
     Monday with the room number.)

     Have a good weekend.

excelr would receive 0% royalty on all external sales.  I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. Also,  I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved.

***********************************************************************

If we do not reach the agreement: 1. Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate)  The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or
				 2. Continue ""as is"" with payment differed for 90 days or merger.

We are sending Accenture official notice as of tomorrow we have 10 business days to workout solution or terminate.	

Any comments or suggestions?


Regards,

Yevgeny

Subject:	BRM Case & Options
Importance:	High

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the excelr for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,


Yevgeny Frolov

Here are the key points that came out of today's meeting:

1. We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the
Knowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type.

2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content
for these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next
week to gather content and a second meeting for review.

3. We will change ""Gas Daily Risk"" to ""Intra-Month Risk"" throughout the
simulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk?

4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems
where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to
hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil
volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too?

Thank you in advance for your help. Have a great Thanksgiving.
Mery

4936,allen-p/deleted_items/445.,<808148.1075862163810.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:

You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls
(or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete
this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we
found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our
users back on-line.

We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked
your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This
process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100
IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and
confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying
data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of
you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than
once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want
displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or
phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right
away.

To our IBS Billpayer clients:

During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill
payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring
payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our
highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the
process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this
information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the
months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence
(and support).

Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and
ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be
one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account
information, please refer to the following information:

1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was
the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed
to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or
contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is
the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you
online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you
receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for
either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @
830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail
(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back
#.

2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the
ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the
last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the
primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS
access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#
(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will
be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:

Name
Address
City, State Zip+4
Phone #
E-Mail Address

After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be
instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can
at this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always
remember that your password is case sensitive.

Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)
ordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.

Sincerely,

Howard Gordon

Kirk - My update was regarding storyline video with actors/actresses. excelr
Legal is now reviewing the scripts we will need for this video shoot.

This timeframe communicated below is NOT applicable for the excelr experts
who will be filming expert stories. The video shoots for the excelr Expert
Stories will be held December 10th and 11th and Ann Chen will be working on
this (I have forwarded her your response below). However, I agree with your

FYI

Sheri
The 3 SME's that have already committed to being on film need to be keep in
the lope regarding the timeline. Also check with these 2 SME's for
additional candidates (i.e. check with Mark Reese to see if Lamar Frazier
would be interested). I would like to be conferenced in on the media calls
& meetings. Also cc me on their emails or forward to me  their  emails.
This will keep me in the loop. Thanks

Kirk -

Thank you for helping us work towards sign-off from excelr Legal. Seeing as
you haven't been closely involved, I thought you'd like an update on our
media production tasks.

As you know, we are completing our planning phase for the production of the
storyline scripts. Our media vendor, Cramer, has been extremely helpful and
enjoyable to work with.  Below is an email from Steve, the director for our
storyline video, explaining where we are in the production process.

Have a good day!

Hey Sheri,
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! I can't believe it's over
already! Anyway...we've shuffled the schedule around, securing the 6th and
7th of
December for the shoot in the studio. We're working on finalizing the
edit dates to reflect that shift. Chris is moving to hold all talent for
those dates.

I guess it's now in the hands of legal! As soon as we confirm the edit
suite
availability
we'll revise and post the new schedule. We're scheduled for our weekly call
tomorrow but if
anything comes up just give me a buzz!
Thanks Sheri!
Steve

Subject: Updates to our Video Production Timeframes and Scope


Hello Steve and Chris -

Recently, there were changes to the overall number of our scenarios in our
simulation. There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have been
discussing. These changes result in:
        Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos
        Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below)
        No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and
        talent) that we have casted for.

Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts.
We have recieved today (mid-day).

Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for our
shoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th.
This recommendation is based on the response I received from our project
manager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our
scripts.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you and have a
wonderful Thanksgiving!

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.

Subject:=09FW:=20


Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  excelr Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f excelr Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of excelr Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of excelr Corp common stock"".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of excelr Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1

Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=
es
Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13
Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658
10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866
Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792
Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10
Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =
administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=
.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =
a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =
 =20

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=
 same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=
er.

Sincerely,


Phillip Allen   =20

excelr employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the excelr Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the excelr Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to excelr employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

WHY THE IDEA OF AN ID CHIP MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL

    Dogs, cats, and cows have them now, so how long
         could it be before a surgically inserted ID
         chip comes to people? In the case of the new
         VeriChip, the answer is how long it takes for
         the FDA to approve it. This is an example of
         a technology that could help some people--but
         hurt lots of others, too. Let me explain why
         the VeriChip should give you shivers, too.

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at excelr.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

WHY THE RIAA OWES US ALL AN APOLOGY

    When recording industry types last week tried
         to get provisions against music swappers
         included in anti-terrorism legislation,
         they trivialized everyone involved in America's
         fight against terrorism--and proved themselves
         to be absolutely the sort of people who'd do
         anything for a buck.

    another AOL inside an OS.

SHOWDOWN: SUN, MS SQUARE OFF OVER WEB SERVICES

    Next week brings us a pair of dueling conferences,
         as Microsoft and Sun try to woo folks into following
         their visions for Web services. But is calling
         the competition a battle a fair assessment,
         when MS is already so far ahead?

    NANOTECHNOLOGY: INSIDE THE 'SINGLE MOLECULE' TRANSISTOR

    Death and taxes aren't life's only inevitabilities
    after all. There's another: miniaturization.
    Latest example comes from Bell Labs,
    which unveiled a carbon transistor
    thousands of times smaller than those

  WHY VIEWSONIC'S NEW MONITOR FALLS FLAT--PLUS MORE
  REVIEWS

   New 17-inch flat-panel displays have become
         almost affordable in the past year. But at
         $799, ViewSonic's new model is at the high
         end of the price range--and the features don't
         justify the cost. Josh and John tell you why
         as they bring you this week's new-product
         roundup.

   Microsoft and the Liberty Alliance may end

Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.  

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 excelr Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

Subject: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence Program


Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

I am planning to build a house in the Texas hillcountry.  The exterior will
be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back.  I am considering the
following features:  stained and scored concrete floors, an open
living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms
all upstairs.  I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly
country.  Can you help?

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way.""

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.
Sincerely,

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?
Brenda

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the 
marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices 
($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the 
time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 
cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to 
report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of 
line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
excelr Online (EOL), excelr's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is excelr's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Subject: Westgate


Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling

was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

 Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy 
Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this 
time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.  
She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

 Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. 
specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

Sincerely,

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that the
construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our
standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.

Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.

It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.

I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are
$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3
bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached
garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.

It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to

13:18 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Cal-ISO Pays $10M To Avoid Rolling Blackouts
Wed -Sources
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator paid
about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and
still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the
state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISO's operation told
Dow Jones Newswires.
But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third
consecutive day.
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.
But that still wasn't enough juice.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as
a means of attracting additional electricity resources.
""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""
Dorinson said.
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay
Pwr Plant
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent
System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy
Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,
Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.
The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the
ISO.
The ISO manages grid reliability.
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling
blackouts.
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

Power Plants
(This article was originally published Wednesday)

   By Jessica Berthold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said
Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by
some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate
reasons.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public
Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power
plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection
of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday
morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron
Thomas said.
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives
returned Wednesday for a full inspection.

   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down
two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,
Thomas said.
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting.
""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""
Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's"" authority.
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday.
""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you
need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegy
spokesman Lynn Lednicky.
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired.
""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.

California.  This subject has already gotten so much press.

Subject: Talking points about California Gas market

Here is my stab at the talking points  to be sent in to FERC along with the 
gas pricing info they requested for the California markets.  Let me or 
Christi know if you have any disagreements, additions, whatever.  I am 
supposed to be out of here at 2:15 today, so if you have stuff to add after 
that, get it to Christi.  Thanks.

First one's free. So are the next thousand.

You know it's true: Video games are addictive. Sure, we could
trap you with a free game of Centipede, then kick up the price
after you're hooked. But that's not how shockwave.com operates.
Shockmachine -- the greatest thing since needle exchange -- is
now free; so are the classic arcade games. Who needs quarters?
Get Arcade Classics from shockwave.com, stick 'em in your
Shockmachine and then play them offline anytime you want.

You're not getting a date this Friday night. But you don't care.
You've got a date with Frogger. This frog won't turn into a handsome
prince(ss), but it's sure to bring back great memories of hopping
through the arcade -- and this time, you can save your quarters for
laundry. Which might increase your potential for a date on Saturday.

Business Meeting or Missile Command? You Decide.

Take it offline! No, it's not a horrible meeting with your boss -
it's Missile Command. Shockmachine has a beautiful feature: you can
play without being hooked to the Internet. Grab the game from
shockwave.com, save it to your hard drive, and play offline! The
missiles are falling. Are you ready to save the world?

player and a Loverboy album...

Subject: REVISION - - LOAD AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES


Most control areas have now reported the amount of load relief and generation 
increase that was experienced over the Peak period (17:00-18:00 PST) on 
December 12.  The data I have received thus far are summarized in the 
following paragraphs.

The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or 
curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.

The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations 
or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.

A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a 
lot of guesswork.  However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.

--  WHAT'S NEW ON Y-LIFE  --
Jon Katz's Internet Domain
Will the Net change everything? Might we be overrun by new gadgets
and new technology? Will our lives be ruled by the almighty dot-
com? Will the Net fail? Don't believe the hype: Katz has a simple
guide to surviving the panic.

--  NET RADIO SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: Lost in the cosmos of Net-radio stations? Sorry, this site
will probably only add to the confusion. FMcities houses over 1,350
stations in North America, organized by city. Sound daunting? It
is... but here's the good part - every site listed here is 100-
percent commercial-free. That's right, nothing but the good stuff.
Sorry, Pepsi. Sorry, McDonald's. Sorry, RJ Reynolds...
http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?70393:8593142

--  INCREDIBLY USEFUL SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: ""Always buy a Swiss watch, an American motorcycle, and a
Japanese radio."" If that's the kind of buying advice the folks at
the water cooler are giving you, it's time to look elsewhere - like
ConsumerSearch. Whether what you want is as complicated as a car or
computer or as simple as a kitchen knife, you'll find links to
reviews here, distilled so that you can quickly scan for the best
items in each category.
http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?70394:8593142

--  PRETTY STRANGE SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: Are you a loser? Do you have lots of time on your hands
because no one would socialize with you if your life depended on
it? Do you have incredible powers of concentration for even the
most mundane and boring tasks? Congratulations! You might be the
person with the strength, stamina, and general dorkiness to win the
World Mouseclicking Competition.

a math teacher would put on that statement? A gardener? A musician?
A person who makes mufflers? There's only one way to find out...

I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and
development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I
think will be interesting to the group.

I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   a
very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime
and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book
covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.

I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -
interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years
learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,
structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have
lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good
background information for sustainable builder folks.

Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.

Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss

     Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.
     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell
$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.
     ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.""
     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.
     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.
     ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell
to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.
     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend.
     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.

PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas

     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day
power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades
ranging from $62.00-$76.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.
     ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of
the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up.""
     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices.
     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million
British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements.
     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.
     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the
$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-
$92.00.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices

     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19
to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the
market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower
on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17
lower at $65.00-$100.00.
     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.
     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired
generation to meet increased weather-related demand.
     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British
thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.
     ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got
people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much
more realistic prices.""
     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00
yesterday.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in
southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.
     ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said.
     ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.""

Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast

     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said.
     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.
     ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one
southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the
north.""
     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.
     ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices,
declined to $60 and less.""
     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95
to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades
were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates.
     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region.
     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices.
     ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility
trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.""
     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern
SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.

U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand

     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.
     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S.
     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15
pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.
     December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.
     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.
     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said.
     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a
megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.
     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.
     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.
Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour.
     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-
up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed.

Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast

     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.
     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing.
     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating.
     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said.
     ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a
Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.""
     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S.
     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling.
     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.
     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.
     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-
term contracts.
     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,
1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatt-hour.
     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said.
     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.
     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.

Why am I not surprised ?

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make
everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have
some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when
they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think

Those same spies/sneaks/sleuths tell me that the format of this

As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our 
comments today along with a cover letter.  We have to fully understand the 
charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today.  It's much 
better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the

 #25 & #33 Both paid 130 on 12/01 and $0 on 12/08.  What is the deal?

 #11  Looks like she is caught up.  When is she due again?


Please email the answers.

 I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated.  
  
  The critical information is  1.  Move in or lease start date
      2.  Lease expiration date
      3.  Rent
      4.  Deposit 
  
  If you have the info you can
  fill in these items  1.  Number of occupants
      2.  Workplace
      

  All the new leases should be the long form.



 The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated 
back in October are  #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38.
  

 I really need to get this by tomorrow.  Please use the rentroll_1215 file to 
input the correct information on all these tenants.  And email it to me 
tomorrow.  You should have all this information on their leases and

I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.

Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I 
have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out 
tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility 
connections?  Other rezoning costs?  

What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

 I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I 
described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in 
San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a 
couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like 
to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not 
require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to 
structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has 
been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the 
equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this 
nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to 
permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be 
important to banks. 

 I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer 
email or fax his financial statement to you.

Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional comments/suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of 
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

 There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other 
for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?

 Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For 
what periods?

 
What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this 
right?  Has the deposit been made yet?

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There 
are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write 
something today.



Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start 
collecting.

The SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.
Bankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy

Michael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize 
a Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super 
Priority.

2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term

Sandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet 
S-T requirements of UDCs.  Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer 
to see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms.  ($3.5B by end of 
April).  Pat Boylston will develop ""public benefit"" language for options 
working with Mike Day.  He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or 
pgboylston@stoel.com.

3. Get Team to Sacramento

Get with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen).  Explain the 
magnitude of the problem.  Get Mike Day to help draft language.  

4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts

Steve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or 
thougths.  Probably of limited value.

5. Update List

Any new information on this should be communicated to the following people as

Date: 01/20/01 22:15

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, 
a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting,"" McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

""I was getting worried,"" he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider 
some changes.""

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining excelr this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,

Phillip:

It looks like a deal with the non gas fired QFs is iminent.  One for the gas 
generators is still quite a ways off.  

The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and reverting 
back to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give back 

I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate 
would be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any time 
soon.

I will keep you abreast of developments.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

This from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm:

RE;  Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest version 
of the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially 
complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who 
switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the 
QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December 
(and maybe earlier).

PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment. 

SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on 2/2/01.

For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's 
purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be 
resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this 
occurred today.

Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  
Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is 
dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it.

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626


Phillip

The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=
it=20
report on Southern California Edison:
=20
I. Cash Needs
Highlights:
SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=
plete=20
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=
s=20
and other measures.=20
Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=
.8=20
million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights:
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20
extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=
lt.=20
Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=
nd=20
payable.
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=
=20
indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20
indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =
its=20
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=
=20
issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20
various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=
 such=20
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=
=20
improvement component as follows (in millions):
Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77
Capital Improvement Costs                383
Total                                             $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=
=20
be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=
om=20
contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=
=20
most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal

Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=

The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=

The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. 

Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

Email or call  me later today.

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  

The key business points are:

1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.

I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject 
to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  

Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes 
if you need to.





Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and 
refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form 
to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this 
information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.

It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with 
the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  He will know what I 
mean.

Talk to you later,

This should probably be researched further.  If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Subject: AEC Volumes at OPAL

Phillip these are the volumes that AEC is considering selling at Opal over 
the next five years.  The structure they are looking for is a firm physical 
sale at a NYMEX related price.  There is a very good chance that they will do 
this all with one party.  We are definitely being considered as that party.  
Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few 
producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River.

What would be your bid for this gas?

Here is the 2/2 rentroll.  The total does not equal the bank deposit.  Your 
earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.

But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer to 
this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and 
send it back.

Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.  I will probably send

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is excelr accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N
total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Phillip,

I spoke with AMF's broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement.  They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,
and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.

AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.

The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,
and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the
details to Wayne McCoy.

I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week.  I will be checking my
messages.

There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N
total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Phillip -

George Richards asked that I drop you a line this morning to go over some
details on the San Marcos project.

1.  First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from
Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in
the transaction.

2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) 
will
be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the
acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer
signing off on the deal.

3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers
deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as
deferred profit has been acceptable.

Thanks,

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the 
concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project 
are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  
Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 
million.  The components are as follows:

 Unit Cost, Site work, &
 builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million

 Land      1.15

 Interim Financing     .85

 Common Areas       .80

 Total     $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to 
get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A 
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce 
the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the 
seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is 
currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to 
the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market 
will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablely 
increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost 
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He 
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  
We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we 
cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   
We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.

Subject:  Sagewood Phase II


George,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the 
Sagewood
Phase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted
pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 
500+
units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, 
this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to $8,868,000.

I have summarized our issues as follows:

1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:

     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment
     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR
     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475
     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417

2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit
turn over.

3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).

4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x 
debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.

5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.

6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:

     Land -                   $1,121,670
     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000
     Cash Equity              $1,419,268
     Total                    $2,955,938

7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage 
of
actual hard construction costs.

George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He 
wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.  

We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to 
determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect 
work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation 
for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were 
proposing was unsupportable by the market.  

My version of a buyout is attached.

I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to 
foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  
Since their cost
and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I 
wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I 
want to respond to their offer asap.

Call me with your thoughts.

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

FYI Western Price Survey Contacts

Cal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.

Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however.

More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.

Here is the rentroll.

My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.  Any special 
reasons?

It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run 
an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine.
I will write you a letter of recommendation.  When do you need it?  You can 
use me as a reference.  In the next two weeks we should really have a good

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

Larrry,

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list
that I need further
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash
investment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cash
investment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the
closing statement or on some other document.

just a note to let you know I will be out of the office Wed(3/21) until 
Thurs(3/23).  The kids are on spring break.  I will be in San Marcos and you 
can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com.

I was planning on stopping by to see Hugo Elizondo on Thursday to drop off a 
check and give him the green light to file for replatting.  What will change 
if we want to try and complete the project in phases.  Does he need to change 
what he is going to submit to the city.

I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning.  He was contracted to complete the 
soils study.  He says he will be done with his report by the end of the 
week.  I don't know who needs this report.  I told Gordon you might call to 
inquire about what work he performed. His number is 512-930-5832.

We spoke on the phone about most of these issues.

Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the 
plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes 
across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for 
the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.

 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of 
course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing 
contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still 
wants to receive this payment.

Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:

Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf 
(rentable)

What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% 
overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.

Why is profit only 4%? 

Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.

What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?

Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who 
receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?

Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage 
would only be 1.16.

Talk to you this afternoon.

Phillip

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are 
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Laird

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.

9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron 
railings?

15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple 
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.  

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, 
maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagan 
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to 
keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the 
left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.  That 
might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch 
would 
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead and 
have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned my 
alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed 
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan 
allowed.

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Phillip

Subject: excelr Center Garage

The excelr Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new excelr Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the excelr Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to excelr Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/excelr or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Subject: Re: SW Gas  

Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regarding 
asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to 
listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to 
protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality 
agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable 
us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder 
value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by 
reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a 
weather product.

As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other 
candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy 
to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our 
opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we 
implement our strategy in California.

Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset 
management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to 
systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

Subject: CAISO demand reduction

Phillip et al.,

I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in 
the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. 
March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand 
over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for 
temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates 
into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as 
compared with the previous year.

Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary 
reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other 
forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making 
total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple 
more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% 
decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the 
retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it 
is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last 
year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in 
Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation 
are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of 
meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general 
economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least 
make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.

Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area 
only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC 
(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO 
portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in 
demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As 
you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum 
smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at 
least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its 
wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several 
mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are 
sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly 
how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's 
economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of 
the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I 
think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already 
realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the 
non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the 
WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 
6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.

I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you 
with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I 
hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any

Thank you for your bid.  I have decided on a floor plan.  I am going to have 
an architect in Austin draw the plans and help me work up a detailed

It sounds like Claudia and Jacques are almost finished with the documents.  
There is one item of which I was unsure.  Was an environmental
report prepared before the original purchase?  If yes, shouldn't it be listed

To make a long story short.

Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal )  for 20 years (I know I 
did the deal)
on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the 
remaining life (now 18 years)

Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border  up to 250,000MMBtu a day 
and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day.

heat rate 10,500  SoCal Border plus $0.50.

I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it.

For what its worth........

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 
41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story 
porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the 
front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The

Subject: Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed  

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed 
doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then 
among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large 
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which 
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some 
additional insight?

Subject: 4-URGENT - OWA Please print this now.


Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the excelr network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules

-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@excelr.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

     Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.
     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal.
     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.
     According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.

Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday.
     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based
trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long.""
     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.
     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.
     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.
     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk.
     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to
$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to
$51.25 and $40.00 indices.

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said.
     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that.""
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.
     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.
     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an
ECAR trader said.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.
     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.
     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.
     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.
""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).""

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.
     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.
Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.
     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.
     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.
""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""
     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.
     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.
     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.
     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.
     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.

U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.
     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.
     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.
     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.

Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.
     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-
214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-
based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing.''
     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more
realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet
outlooks.''
     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,
down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was
a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.
     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour
with 140 megawatts exchanged.
     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours
generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.

Subject: Transport p&l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange 
to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.   
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your 
overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.
  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

Subject: Thoughts on Presentation

It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The 
WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" 
generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.

On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal 
consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Let's talk.

Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The excelr Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin

as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With excelr's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One excelr, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  excelr VP/MD PRC 
requests that all excelr Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.excelr.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.excelr.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Hey Phillip,
I received your note from Celeste.  I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator and 
need for you to fill out the attached Needs Assessment form before I can send 
you any resumes.  Also, would you be interested in the new class?  Analysts 
start with the business units on Aug. 3rd and Assoc. start on Aug. 28th.  We 
are starting to place the Associates and would like to see if you are 
interested.  Please let me know.  

Once I receive the Needs Assessment back (and you let me know if you can wait 
a month,) I will be happy to pull a couple of resumes for your review.  If 
you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

This is exactly what we need.  Would it possible to add the prior day for each of the dates below to the pivot table.  In order to validate the curve shift on the dates below we also need the prior days ending positions.

HOPE AHEAD: WHAT I LEARNED FROM 2001'S TRAGEDIES

    As years go, 2001 sucked. But adversity teaches
         us more important lessons than prosperity.
         So my bet is that 2001 and the upcoming 2002
         will prove to be very educational--and in
         ways that matter. Here's what I learned this
         year, as I saw technology--and the world--change
         for good.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the excelr South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

    Could Microsoft be stalling? The nine

    asked a federal judge to reject Microsoft's

level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You
say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I
just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost
was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we
can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90
per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the
true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Richard,

I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with
SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can
decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints
completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with
8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.

I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that
is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of
$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within
that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built
house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a
radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same
energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to
a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.
That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional
costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?
Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help
me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from
Wink with Premier based on you reference.

Thank you for your help.

Attached is the first draw request, I will need some of these funds immediately. I think checks out of Bishops Corner, L.P. may be the easiest, or you can wire money to me and I can write the checks when needed.  Please let me know how you wish to handle this and I will proceed.

Additionally, it is getting close to closing. I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible. We can handle this in two ways. I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.

As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

Renee,

Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of excelr Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of excelr Corp. common stock.""  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.

We understand your continued frustration and express our sincerest
apologies for our inability to give complete and accurate answers to
your questions. The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3)
possibilities:

1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was
the correct password) and been given the error message that you have
exceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message ""You
have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again
tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password
reset."" This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one
quickly with you online (on the phone). Should you receive this message,
please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard
Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @
830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please
leave your Name, Account # and call back #.

2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the
ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the
last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the
primary account holder.

3)  If you see this error message ""Invalid login; please try again""
(after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last
category. Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly
(we will not release any information about these accounts until we
verify that all information is correct and accurate). We are finalizing
these accounts today and should have them available for access this
afternoon (late) or this evening. Once we release these accounts for IBS
access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#
(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will
be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:

Name
Address
City, State Zip+4
Phone #
E-Mail Address

After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be
instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can
at this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always
remember that your password is case sensitive.

Should you get into IBS (before early evening [6:00pm]), the balance and
transactional information displayed is as of 11/16/01 (Friday night). We
will have this information updated by 6:00pm (hopefully), and then
information will be as of Monday (11/19/01). Again we want to thank you
for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to
continuing to service your IBS needs in the future.

Subject:	SMEs for expert stories


Hello Kirk --

Hope you are doing well!

Just wanted to let you know that I will be taking over the role of
producint the expert stories for our simulation.  I understand you will be
obtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories.  Thank you
for your help.  Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind:

Number of SMEs needed:  10
Number of expert stories: 20-25
Characteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, a
mix of structurers, originators and traders


I've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we will
follow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories.  The main
difference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of
11/30.  By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with
them for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at
least 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday.

(11/26-11/28)
                         --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs
(11/28-11/30)
                         --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding
the simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to
discuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot.
(12/3-12/6)
               --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content we
need and where they can provide stories.
                          --Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review the
stories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the video
shoot.
                          --Make changes to stories, if necessary.
                          --Send final stories and video shoot logistics to
SMEs
(12/10-12/12)
                          --Video shoot

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ann

Here are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with excelr? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).

Sheri

When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a ""Dateline"" type theme for one, and a ""60 Minute"" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?

I have combined all of the storyline scripts (Intro and Scenarios 1-7) for
you to send to Legal for their review. Your comments were incorporated in
the scripts for scenarios 1 and 2.  We decided to refer to the company as
both Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. so that
there is no confusion with excelr International. We will not have a coach
exit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting.  In reference
to your concern over ""locking in a price"" as collusion, those were
Phillip's words but we hope Legal will decide if we need to change them.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kirk -

Thank you for helping us work towards sign-off from excelr Legal. Seeing as
you haven't been closely involved, I thought you'd like an update on our
media production tasks.

As you know, we are completing our planning phase for the production of the
storyline scripts. Our media vendor, Cramer, has been extremely helpful and
enjoyable to work with.  Below is an email from Steve, the director for our
storyline video, explaining where we are in the production process.

Have a good day!

Hey Sheri,
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! I can't believe it's over
already! Anyway...we've shuffled the schedule around, securing the 6th and
7th of
December for the shoot in the studio. We're working on finalizing the
edit dates to reflect that shift. Chris is moving to hold all talent for
those dates.

I guess it's now in the hands of legal! As soon as we confirm the edit
suite
availability
we'll revise and post the new schedule. We're scheduled for our weekly call
tomorrow but if
anything comes up just give me a buzz!
Thanks Sheri!
Steve

Subject: Updates to our Video Production Timeframes and Scope


Hello Steve and Chris -

Recently, there were changes to the overall number of our scenarios in our
simulation. There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have been
discussing. These changes result in:
        Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos
        Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below)
        No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and
        talent) that we have casted for.

Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts.
We have recieved today (mid-day).

Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for our
shoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th.
This recommendation is based on the response I received from our project
manager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our
scripts.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you and have a
wonderful Thanksgiving!

Could you please e-mail me the draw file you created for Bishops Corner.  I
was working on submitting it to you and rather then recreate it I should
just have you send it back to me to fill in the new draw totals.

Also, I need the vendor payee list that you created for the Land and Soft
costs. I need to re-format it by draw number and to the Bank One format, and
again it would be easier to get it from you then to re-create it.

With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.

I have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.

In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you. With best regards, Jim Wills

Subject:=09FW:=20


Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  excelr Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f excelr Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of excelr Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of excelr Corp common stock"".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of excelr Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1

Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=
es
Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13
Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658
10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866
Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792
Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10
Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =
administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=
.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =
a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =
 =20

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=
 same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=
er.

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.

5479,allen-p/inbox/87.,<102930.1075863149717.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:

You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls
(or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete
this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we
found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our
users back on-line.

We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked
your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This
process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100
IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and
confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying
data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of
you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than
once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want
displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or
phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right
away.

To our IBS Billpayer clients:

During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill
payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring
payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our
highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the
process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this
information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the
months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence
(and support).

Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and
ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be
one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account
information, please refer to the following information:

1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was
the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed
to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or
contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is
the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you
online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you
receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for
either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @
830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail
(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back
#.

2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the
ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the
last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the
primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS
access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#
(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will
be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:

Name
Address
City, State Zip+4
Phone #
E-Mail Address

After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be
instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can
at this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always
remember that your password is case sensitive.

Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)
ordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.

Sincerely,

Howard Gordon
Network Manager

Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss

     Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.
     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell
$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.
     ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.""
     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.
     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.
     ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell
to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.
     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend.
     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.

PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas

     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day
power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades
ranging from $62.00-$76.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.
     ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of
the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up.""
     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices.
     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million
British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements.
     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.
     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the
$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-
$92.00.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices

     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19
to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the
market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower
on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17
lower at $65.00-$100.00.
     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.
     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired
generation to meet increased weather-related demand.
     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British
thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.
     ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got
people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much
more realistic prices.""
     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00
yesterday.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in
southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.
     ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said.
     ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.""

Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast

     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said.
     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.
     ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one
southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the
north.""
     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.
     ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices,
declined to $60 and less.""
     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95
to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades
were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates.
     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region.
     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices.
     ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility
trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.""
     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern
SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.

U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand

     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.
     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S.
     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15
pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.
     December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.
     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.
     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said.
     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a
megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.
     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.
     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.
Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour.
     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-
up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed.

Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast

     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.
     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing.
     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating.
     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said.
     ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a
Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.""
     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S.
     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling.
     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.
     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.
     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-
term contracts.
     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,
1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatt-hour.
     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said.
     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.
     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.

Today: A reader writes, ""Can I update all my Netscape Bookmarks at
the same time? With nearly 500 of them, I don't have time to check
each one individually."" Whoa there, Mr. Busy Bee, you don't *have*
to check those bookmarks individually, says the Guru. You can check
them all at once, and you don't even have to download any confusing
programs to do it.

Today: It's a surprisingly long list of ""I used to be a ____

a math teacher would put on that statement? A gardener? A musician?

Subject: REVISION - - LOAD AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES


Most control areas have now reported the amount of load relief and generation 
increase that was experienced over the Peak period (17:00-18:00 PST) on 
December 12.  The data I have received thus far are summarized in the 
following paragraphs.

The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or 
curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.

The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations 
or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.

A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a 
lot of guesswork.  However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.

for the hikes, we would like to.  The Commission is getting calls from

Subject: Talking points about California Gas market

Christy,

 I read these points and they definitely need some touch up.  I don't 
understand why we need to give our commentary on  why prices are so high in 
California.  This subject has already gotten so much press.  

Phillip

Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

     Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.
     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal.
     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.
     According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.

Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday.
     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based
trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long.""
     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.
     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.
     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.
     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk.
     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to
$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to
$51.25 and $40.00 indices.

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said.
     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that.""
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.
     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.
     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an
ECAR trader said.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.
     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.
     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.
     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.
""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).""

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.
     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.
Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.
     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.
     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.
""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""
     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.
     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.
     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.
     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.
     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.

U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.
     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.
     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.
     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.

Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.
     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-
214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-
based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing.''
     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more
realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet
outlooks.''
     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,
down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was
a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.
     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour
with 140 megawatts exchanged.
     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours
generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.

I typed up this resume from scratch in 10 minutes.  Will it do?  If you work for the same company for 8 years your resume tends to get dusty.
Let me know if I need to beef it up or if I need to include any financial information.

I wanted you to review it before I sent it to Montez.  If it is ok please forward to Montez.

I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter.  Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.  I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.  I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.  The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.  Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.  Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.  The utilities are already in her name.

In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.  Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.  Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.  I expect to have that done by Friday.

I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday.  As far as the utilities go,  I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand.

I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.

Phillip

I spoke with Pauline and she says she is ready to transfer the utilities.
However, she wants to get your signed permission to transfer their ownership
interests to the J&P Kuo, Ltd. for purposes of paying back the two notes.
(per her attorneys advice).  She is ready to sign the settlement, but she
has not been able to talk to her lawyer who is tied up in court.

I have attached a Word file with the a letter to them which authorizes the
transfer.  If it is acceptable please sign and fax to her directly at
830-372-5400.  Please fax to me also.

Thanks.

Two changes need to be made to the list.  First, Jason Wolfe is a trading track analyst on the west desk.  Second,  Matt Lenhart should be an Associate as his duties and responsibilities are identical to Monique S, Jay R., and Randy G.  I don't know if this change can be made administatively or if I need to bring this up during PRC.  Please let me know.

Here is a short letter that indicates I will give consent contingent to the items we discussed.  I didn't make any reference to why I took the utilities out of my name.
I left that for you to explain to her that we need to have a cutoff date so we can calculate the final amount.  I hope you can make her understand that I have not been obligated to keep these in my name for some time.  Since my attorney is out of town until Monday and I doubt that she has all the documents in place to actually place the property in a limited partnership (certainly not the 1st lienholders consent) we will have to work together next week.

Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?  I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.  

Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.  

I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:

Sales price:		2,100,000
Purchase price		1,200,000
Fees&Devel costs	  500,000

Profit			 400,000

The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.

I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.

I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify. 

 First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?

Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.

If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?

Thank you in advance for your help.

I understand you spoke to Jacques Craig about the consent and assignment documents.  Maybe the attorneys can work this out faster than we have.  

I spoke to the city this morning and the final bills are to be mailed out today.  So I should have an amount on Wednesday.  I will email and fax the amount and the supporting bills as soon as possible.  Maybe we can close out the release this week and consent to the assignment pending 1st lien holder approval.

I have a favor to ask you.  I received the check from Pauline that was due May 20th.  However, I have misplaced it.  Can you ask her to put a stop on her 1st check and send me another (net of any costs for the stop payment).   If you would prefer for me to call her myself, I will.

transfer again.  She was mad about not being told about the transfer before
it happened.  I wasn't sure about the exact date so by the time I told her;
it had already been done.  She would have been pissed either way.

There are two additional items involving the sale that she is requesting.

1.  She wants to transfer the pay phone account
2.  She wants reimbursement for the bills that I am faxing to you.

I will talk to her again about the check that she sent.

Two items:

1.  I spoke to John McKay about Sumas.  His views seem well thought out.  He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40
	His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium.
	In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book.


 
2.  I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues.

El Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements docket.  They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso suggests the following information be collected:
the name of the counter party to the financial trade
the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade
all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu
the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates
the date on which the deal was entered into
the type of trade

El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in California in balance.)

jeff,

Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.

Subject:	Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR Contracts--Privileged and Confidential
Sensitivity:	Confidential

PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and excelr.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to excelr for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that excelr fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Per last week's call, I am circulating updated FERC staff talking points to the entire Western Wholesale group.  This version of the talking points incorporates comments from Steffes, Walton, and Perrino.

Phillip Allen: people on the call were wondering if there are any informal messages the West gas desk would like to relay to FERC staff. Notes, however, that ex parte contacts such as these generally must avoid issues that are being currently litigated by the FERC.

Jim, 

Following up on the message I left you, I thought I'd send you some of the basic information on the Crossroads project to see if you have any interest in that area:

The facility will be a high flexibility, bedded salt cavern
Initial startup is expected in summer 2002 with 2 bcf working gas, eventual rampup to 3 bcf 
75 MMCF/D injection (at 2 bcf working)
200 MMCF/D withdrawal (at 2 bcf working)
Located near Brush, Colorado, in Morgan County.
Located at far east end of PSCo system, 7 miles from CIG and 10 miles from Kinder Morgan

This is all the information I have at the moment, in addition to some maps which you are welcomed to look at.  Garry Wilson and I will be meeting with the developer in Denver on Monday, but he'd like to see if we have interest sooner than that.  I apologize for the last-minute nature of the request, but we were just hoping for an initial gauge of your interest.  

Do you have any use for this capacity?  If so, at what price?  What would your timing requirements be?  Would you have any other conditions that would increase interest in this capacity?

Thanks for your attention.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions, I'll try following up with you tomorrow if you ahve any free time.  Thanks!

I noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway.  =
First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.  Second, p=

Here is the article:

Sector 2 plan geets boost from council  By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter  H=
ome and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised futu=
re land use plan to consult for development in the area.  The San Marcos Ci=
ty Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two =
Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 squa=
re mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable a=
nd appropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affe=
cting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corne=
r of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  We=
atherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of vari=
ous city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner say=
s were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two =
plan.  Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no dir=
ect effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density resid=
ential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of=
 commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven a=
dditional acres of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight a=
cres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is su=
ggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing=
 development in the revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of co=
mmercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to ""community commerci=
al"" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ens=
ure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete wit=
h buffering and landscaping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed t=
o separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan. =
 However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew som=
e concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may po=
se on the busy state highway.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing th=
e proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Ave=
nue.  While the state highway department and city would have input into the=
 plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron=
 Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between=
 the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.  Council member Jane Hughso=
n supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sect=
or Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in th=
e area as development proceeds.  ""I'd rather say ""no' and if someone comes =
us with a really good idea, look at it then,"" Hughson said.  Councilman Ed =
Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of th=
e curb cut.  ""It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happe=
n there,"" Mihalkanin said.  A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclud=
e curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San =
Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting =
against the move. Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the=
 meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from severa=
l residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good =
compromise.  Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active crit=
ic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concernin=
g the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests =
of the city as a whole.  ""This is not a victory for one side or the other,""=
 said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to=

I spoke with their attorney this AM, and he said that he is reviewing the
settlement document and will like to get everything settled before he leaves
on vacation. (even though he has had the document for a month?)

I suggested that he talk to Jacques to speed the process up.  Pauline may
have been slowing the process by not giving him info.

You should probably have Jacques speak with their attorney (Kolb) if he does
not make contact by tomorrow.

Also, Pauline wants to know if you have any info. on a contact name for the

I sent a copy of an article discussing oil and gas stocks.  The main idea was that everyone is selling so it is probably a good time to be buying.  I had lost your email so I sent it to Gary and asked him to forward it to you.  I guess he is technology challenged.  The article was just one analyst's opinion.  He can find dozens of articles just like it online.  It was not important.

On a different note, Kelsey is at T Bar M camp this week.  Heather is very anxious about this.  The only info we get is through the camp's website.  Each day they post candid pictures from the prior day.  We scan through to try and spot Kelsey.  So far we have found her in one picture each day.  It is kind of fun trying to find her.  If you want to give it a try, go to their website at  www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml <http://www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml> .  Click on sports camp parent connection.  There are a few paragraphs about each day and a spot to click for the pictures from that day.  See if you can find her.

Pat and Gary's house looks like it is taking shape fast.  The Meckels seem to do good work.  I might have to reconsider using them for our house.
We should be in town Friday.  We have to be at the camp at 8:30 on Saturday.  See you soon.

Glad to hear their attorney contacted you.  I agree that we will not consent to the assignment unless the release and utility issue are resolved, but I would prefer to get the utility and release resolved without waiting for the 1st lienholder to consent.  Can we wrap up those issues and sign some sort of agreement to consent subject to Southern Pacific Bank's consent.

Press Release
SOURCE: El Paso Corporation

El Paso Announces Binding Open Season for Additional Capacity on Line 2000

HOUSTON, July 10 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Natural Gas Company, a subsidiary of El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG - news), announced today a binding open season for 320 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of pipeline capacity from the Keystone and Waha areas of the Permian Basin in West Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions.

The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations.

The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists.

``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company.

Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687.

El Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North America and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of new technologies, such as clean coal and liquefied natural gas, to address critical energy shortages across the globe.

Hunter, Scott, Tom & Barry,
We have been meeting with the Ocean Energy, Inc. (""OEI"") management team over the last several months discussing the asset management of OEI's gas, as well as  excelr's ability to provide additional Producer Services (including the operations of certain pipeline facilities, outsourcing services and excelr systems outsourcing). We are moving forward with the project and have divided it into two phases. Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services. 
For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001. 
Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity. 
OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration.  Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings. 
The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin. 
This opportunity will provide gas across North America for excelr with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas packages.
The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please contact me at X-36784.

I finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options.  Unfortunately, they are committed to Paine Webber for the foreseeable future.  The two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place.  They are less concerned with the services that Paine Webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options.  

It was worth a try.

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

(2) a mandatory expansion of the pipeline system to be used to meet El Paso=

(3) that FERC prohibit El Paso from collecting demand charges for firm serv=

capable of meeting its firm service obligations.

A Technical Conference in El Paso's Order No. 637 proceeding (RP00-336) is =
scheduled for Wed., July 18, 2001 to discuss El Paso's systemwide capacity =

Here is the payoff info for the unsecured note:

Assuming the note is paid before the 7/20 payment is due:  $36,523 + $7/day accrued interest since 6/20.  For example, if paid on 7/18 the balance would be $36,719.

If the Kuo's make the payment due on 7/20, then the payoff amount would be $36,304 + $7/day accrued interest after 7/20.

By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies ""to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports.""

Subject:	El Paso Update 7/23/011


Sources at OPS indicate that once OPS completes its review of line 1110 and approves it to come back online, there is no formal process to grant El Paso permission to bring the entire system back to full capacity at 1.1 bcf/d. Therefore, once the inspection/repairs are completed by El Paso, the company will seek permission from OPS to resume to full service. OPS would probably grant them approval within a matter of days. The uncertainty still lies in the time it will take to interpret pigging data and for OPS to conduct its review.",Non Abusive

Keith and I were able to resolve our concerns about having the GP as a  corporation.  Several CPA's assured us that the tax treatment fears we had were not a significant risk.  Therefore,  we are ready to finalize the agreements.  What is the next step?  Do we just execute the copies we have?

Subject:	Mid C New deals Sept 24

Phillip, here is the breakdown on new deals and option values for Sept 24.

Options:

Sold put with strike of 150 and volume of 30,800
Sold put with strike of 220 and volume of 92,400
Buy put with strike of 175 and volume of 61,600
Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30,800
Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30,800
Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30,800

Total new deal value $(3,552,534)

Value in exercising of deals (liquidations) $3,642,100

Net value to book = $89,566

The reason for the difference in new deal value for LT - NW between the new deal report and the DPR of approx $(2,290,630) was due to the fact that one of the swaps that was entered for the exercised options was incorrect. The correct value was determined by running a minibook and the difference was $(2,290,630) and so the new deal value was adjusted accordingly.

Congratulations on being team leader for the video.  

Here are some ideas:

1.	A long winded VP drones on and on asking questions about an analyst that is not in his/her group while the camera flashes to other bored VP's.  It could start with sighs and rolling eyes then build to comical efforts to be put out of their misery. (gun to head or rope around neck)
2.	Include some digs at John Lavorato's quirks like always pulling up his shirt sleeves.

Just some ideas to get things started.  Obviously, the gas market is slow today.

I am going to miss the meeting with Vladi about Z6 and weather hedges.  I have been planning to be on vacation on August 1st -August 3rd and we are driving this afternoon before the kids get too cranky.

I went over the analysis with Vladi.  It still seems that the bias of the weather products towards an above normal winter and the averaging vs event nature of the weather options keep them from being an effective hedge for Z6.

See you on Monday.

For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.

Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.

Phillip

Subject:	Answer 

For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.

I want to personally thank you for supporting the BRM deal and I look forward to working with each of you to make this deal a success. I have provided the email below for your information.  The current next steps are as follows:

Yevgeny & I will meet with Vince Kaminski (tomorrow) to get his support as an Exec SME and get his nominee for content SME;
Phillip will provide his nominee for content SME (by tomorrow);
I will contact both Phillip's & Vince's content SME nominee (By Wednesday); and
All SME's will meet and have a demo provided by Accenture. (as soon as possible and feasible based on schedules)

Thus the SME picture should look like  this

Exec SME's : Phillip, Vince, & John
Content SME: Dutch, Phillip's Nominee, Vince's Nominee, Mark Reese and a structuring nominee (Phillip can you provide me with your suggestions again, Thanks)

If you have any questions contact me at your convenience.

Kirk, here are two documents I have revised, assuming a start date for the
week of August 24 for actual content work/design, not just kick off.  This
slips our delivery into the new year.  Please review and let's talk about
them the next time we meet.  I hope your meetings are going well.


List of deliverables and tentative and aggressive due dates, all to be
revised once we start.  In addition, as we move through design, many of
these deliverables will become unit based to ease our tracking of progress,
but since we don't know how many topics/expert stories... that we are
building, it is difficult to create that tracking now.

(See attached file: Deliverables Tracking 081301.xls)


Here is the revised list I mentioned as our SME goals each week, assuming a
start as stated above.
(See attached file: SME Meeting Schedule 081301.doc)

I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.  Give me a call and let me

Phillip,

I spoke to Wendy this morning who mentioned that you would be signing both
the Special Warranty Deed and the First Amendment and FedExing both
documents to me.  Enclosed please find the Deed and the First Amendment.
Please compare the enclosed Deed with the version of the Deed in your
possession.  I don't think anything has changed, but I want to make sure
that the version of the Deed you sign is the latest version.  Also enclosed
is the First Amendment.  The only change to this document from the version I
e-mailed to you a few days ago is the insertion of ""June 29, 2001"" as the
date the Title Company acknowledged receipt of AMHP's $25,000 Extension Fee.

Please sign both documents and FedEx them to me at the address described
below.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at (512)

This spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply & demand in San Marcos by unit.  Next, I want to look at the numbers by bedroom.  Let's compare numbers.

Here is a list of questions:

1.	Unit mixes of all proposed projects.
2.	Completion date of  Blazer Development (220), Capstone (270), Melrose (202), Bonner-Carr. (186)
3.	Is the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds?


 
This spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005.  San Marcos will have over 6,000 units.  If the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5%.  That would not be a disaster.

Tomorrow, I would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data.

Let me know what you think.

Attached is a draft of our rehearing request on the order FERC issued in RM01-9 requiring sellers of gas into California to file information on their sales, transport, and purchases.  The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.  We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days.
Please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself (713-853-5840) or Leslie (505-623-6778) by COB Wednesday (8/22).

Jeff,

JP Morgan is comparing a file of calculated daily curve shift to actual P&L.  Gas P&L for 2001 was 1.2 Billion but the theoretical curve shift was -13 million.  This is from a file assembled by David Port which is attached.  The biggest difference is 9/14 ($500 million).  This is probably money coming out of reserves.  Besides that day there are many smaller differences.  Can you help me by pulling the P&L packets from some of the larger days?  The answer might be that the file from RAC is bogus.

Subject:	El Paso 1110

Good morning. My name is Nancy Turner, and I have recently joined Kristin Walsh's competitive analysis group where I follow gas industry issues. 

As you may recall, earlier this summer we informed you that El Paso's line 1110 had been brought down for repair, pigging and OPS review.  Our sources at El Paso and OPS have indicated to us this week that line 1110 is expected to come back online on September 1st.  We understand that the throughput on the entire system at that time should be at least 920 Mmcf/d (same as before it went offline). However, there is a strong possibility that OPS may grant the system permission to return to it's full capacity at 1.1 Bcf/d on September 1st.

We are trying to obtain more information on the capacity issue and hope to have this confirmed early next week.  We will keep you posted, but if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at X 51623 or Kristin at X 39510.

I see that you talked to Andrew this afternoon so that you have an understanding of where we are on that front.

I am still analyzing the demand/supply numbers we talked about.  I am going to be working in Austin in the morning and San Marcos in the afternoon.

I have a number of things to verify before I feel I can finish the supply/demand question accurately.  I also need to follow up on the permits and see where they are in process, I need to check on Tas review and a number of other items.

Talk to you soon.

Subject:	excelr Center Garage

The excelr Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in an excelr Contract garage you are being offered a parking space in the new excelr Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the excelr Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to excelr Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/excelr or 713-853-7060  with any questions.

Matt,
As we discussed several times previously, including earlier this week, Nine Energy Services LLC is a CREDIT WATCH COUNTERPARTY and a WMBE (Women and Minority owned Business Enterprises), which means that ALL trades need to be approved by Credit and documented with a Resale Agreement. Every time we transact, ENA's Confirmation Group needs to know from whom to expect payment, i.e. San Diego Gas & Electric. The nature of the transaction exposes ENA to secondary risk with the ultimate counterparty. On another note, some transactions COULD be declined by Credit due to direct exposure/risk that the ENA has with the Counterparty, outside of any WMBE Transactions. 

Sitara Deal Number 1014433 was another violation of Corporate Credit Policy. In the future, please contact Credit before transacting with any Credit Watch Counterparty.

Political Update

International

US Arab allies (Egypt, Saudi, Jordan, Kuwait, UAE) walking a fine line.  Masses believe US got what it deserves, but leaders have to condemn attacks to maintain relations with Washington.  Moderate Arab leaders are concerned that support for attacks at home -- and possible US reactions to strike -- will increase instability and could lead to major upheaval in their countries.  Saudi sources expect ""state of confusion"" to exist for immediate period ahead.

In the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than bin Laden was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator. 

Oil Politics

OPEC's Rodriguez has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Saudi officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Naimi).  Unofficially, we have reports that Saudi officials reporting that the terrorist incident ""relieves pressure on us to make anti-US moves"" in oil policy.",Non Abusive

Did you receive the fax from Kevin Kolb with a small change on page 2.  It also included the conveyance and assignment document.  Does this look ok to you? Is the language ""Transfer will occur when first lien holder, Pacific Southwest Bank, approves the assignment"" sufficient?  Hopefully it is ok.  Let me know if it is and I will come by your office to pick up executable copies.

Phillip;

These are just what I started with.  I have not really fully looked at each
spreadsheet for error in logic or other.

I notice the primary difference between the existing projects and new
projects is that on an existing project you have to had value to be able to
increase the cash flow to be able to finance out of them to be able to
achieve a decent IRR. Thus you have to pay as little as possible, increase
the cash flow (i.e.-renovations), to compete with the quality of new
construction.  And no I am not making numbers up nor am I sold on new
construction strictly.  I just am working on the best look as possible.

I look forward to discussing this further.

Sincerely,

Dan, I am interested.  I know that Sue Mara spoke with Ron on this subject also, although I was not on the call.  The matter was not discussed on our Western Wholesale call this morning either, since I did not become aware of it till later.  I would therefore like to receive input from Sue and others on our team about this, getting final sign off to proceed from Linda Robertson and Jim Steffes.  If we elect to proceed, it would be appropriate to bill all participating marketers in equal shares.  Thanks.  Ray

Phillip;

These are just what I started with.  I have not really fully looked at each
spreadsheet for error in logic or other.

I notice the primary difference between the existing projects and new
projects is that on an existing project you have to had value to be able to
increase the cash flow to be able to finance out of them to be able to
achieve a decent IRR. Thus you have to pay as little as possible, increase
the cash flow (i.e.-renovations), to compete with the quality of new
construction.  And no I am not making numbers up nor am I sold on new
construction strictly.  I just am working on the best look as possible.

I look forward to discussing this further.

Sincerely,



Greg Thorse

John,

The spreadsheet below (""Valuation Summary.."") calculates the value excelr would realize if we turned back the capacity or released it at full tolls.  As of 9/17 mids, the 200,000/d leg would generate $16,918,907 if turned back.  There is still a substantial amount of value above variable costs on the books.  For 03-06, variable costs are around $0.15 but the mid-market spread is $0.45.  The PV volume for that term is 22,000 contracts.

Your initial concerns around Processes and Knowledge Acquisition were relayed to Accenture and they stated that these will be addressed in the learning objectives, which will be the more detail backup to this high level documents.

Yevgeny
Your Fundamentals issue was handled by the i.e. notation on this document. In addition, Accenture said Yes that this document is aligned with the Topics Document and will be aligned with the more detailed back up document (i.e. Outline) that will support the Topics Document.

I would modify this document slightly.  The first section is titled ""Introduction to Risk Management"" and the second section is ""Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products"".  However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section.  I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.  Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.  Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.  The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.  You might want to include the commodity 101 info here, at least gas and power.

Phillip,

I am trying to press Bank to get the Deed of Trust to you. I am in a balanc=
ing act between moving on the construction and holding until the lien is pe=
rfected. I talked to Cheerie and she said the person in Dallas is trying to=
 get it done today, however, she may not finish it out today, which means i=
t will be sent for Thursday morning delivery to a sister Ticor office for s=
ignature and recording.  Have they told you any of this? Or do I need to ma=
ke sure you know when, where, and how as soon as I know.

I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal an=
d gave the information to us over the phone.  The appraised value as built =
is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695.  The problem is the Land Value is $=
1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in Ja=
nuary.  Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top=
 of this showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to s=
how an increase in value?.  I am tending to think we are going to reduce ou=
r overall loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost =
and some other small adjustments to costs. This would reduce our overall de=
bt and resultant equity requirement. The main difference in committing to a=
 greater loan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be o=
ut of balance in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk be=
ing short and needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. I have be=
en working on this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effec=
ts each change will have on your equity and return.

We are firm on the construction numbers given to you previously and we have=
 had a number of additional costs which we have been able to absorb in the =
overall construction budget.  The biggest is the detention pond dredging wh=
ich has gone up in cost.  The only area left to work through is the foundat=
ion/concrete number and I am confident we will hit that one on the mark. Th=
us, overall I am comfortable with the Hard Cost numbers at this point.

I am attempting to get with Irwin and Cheerie and seeing if we can get the =
final Doc's put together. Have'nt been able to get a meeting yet.

I just got interrupted in another meeting.  Let me know if there are any qu=
estions today.

I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.

I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.  That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?   Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference.

Phillip -

Thank you for giving us your feedback on the first seven topic outlines.
I've incorporated your thoughts, but was hoping you could take a look at
them since we didn't have a chance to go over them together. The outlines
and explanations are below. Could you respond back by EOD Monday in hopes
for us to send these outlines for Final Signoff?

Lastly, I was wondering if I could stop by (your's or Ina's desk) and pick
up your comments about the last three topic outlines by EOD Monday. Can you
let me know if this is possible?

Organizational Structure.
You  jotted down ""Jeff Gosset, M to M, P&L, and Positions"". We have an
entire section about Mark to Market in the Risk Management Inputs topic.
P&L statements and Position reports are large sections in the Accounting
and Reporting topic. In addition, we discuss Mid Office in the Overview
page of this topic (org. structure). Is this enough or were you thinking
something in addition to what I just mentioned.
(See attached file: Framework Org Structure_4.doc)

Accounting and Reporting
I've incorporated the areas of  ""G&L, cash payments, and reconcilation into
the last section of the outline. Is this what you were thinking?

If you decide to move to Kerrville I know of an excellent builder that I
have worked with in the past.

He has built numerous custom homes in the Kerrville\Fredericksburg area that
are very high quality.  He has excellent long time crews using local German
craftsmen. They do outstanding trim work and framing.  Most of his houses
are Texas style with solid rock walls, standing seam roofs, antique wood
flooring, cabinets, etc.

Let me know if you are interested.

The seller said she would fax the numbers tomorrow morning (12\14).  She
says the NOI is around $300,000 per year.  After taking into account the
management fee she says they will accept a price of $2,700,000.

This is not a bad price for a well maintained\located property with large

Phillip:

The target for end of October is 1283. We're not sure what's driving the day to day variation. Direct effects of recent precipitation, combined with some very big precip forecast errors, are part of the explanation, but there also appears to be something going on with management of the non-treaty storage that BPA's cached upstream in Arrow. We've been looking into that, and hope to get some news via Technical Management Team today.

From a multi-purpose project manager's perspective, I think that current reservoir elevation is one or two feet too high, so I do expect drawdown by month end. I also suspect that there are some limits in the non-treaty storage approaching that require at least partial withdrawal.

The net effect should be a rise in production-- no more downstream storage is available and upstream releases will increase, certainly by November 1, but probably earlier.

Jeff:

I talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in 
having our class build a shed for you.  We pretty much make whatever you 
would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are 
durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner 
is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only 
charged for the materials.

Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most 
economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a 
given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar 
style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have 
usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening.  I would think that 
would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your 
dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold 
over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually 
varies between $800 and $900.



Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is 
a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum 
soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe 
Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize 
and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your 
dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.
The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently 
building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up 
door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be 
roughly $1500.


We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your 
needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the 
easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday 
October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to 
finish that one on time.

If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:

Greetings Phillip,

I received your phone message.  Thanks for the update.  I have been talking
with contractors and Spring Valley.  At this point we are trying to
determine whether the addition over the garage would be workable.  Heather
probably told you that I am meeting with a contractor on 11/7 at your home
to get a firm bid on the project.  I spoke today with the Spring Valley
building consultant and faxed him some detail.  There are a couple of
possible problems he is looking at and we'll possibly need to get a variance
from the decision makers when the time comes.

In the meantime, I printed out the earnest money contract and sellers
disclosure forms from the website you found.  We are waiting on the final
word from Spring Valley to move ahead.  I'll let you know when we have some
new information.

Thanks,

The Social Security and Medicare tax has been previously withheld on your deferral.  You would be subject to only Federal Income Tax withholding on the distribution.

Subject:	Topic Framework Updates!


Hi Kirk,

Here are the answers to some of your questions and concerns on the Topic
Frameworks.  These updates, along with discussions with SMEs, took a total
of one hour.

Accounting and Reporting - (1) Deal Flow - <<According to Berney Aucoin>>
there is no difference between an Orginator/Marketer  on the deal flow,
they stated that a deal is a deal and it is the same for everyone.  (2)
Roles associated within the Desk - <<According to Berney Aucoin >> Admin
support and Commerical support should not be added.  We are concentrating
on the major roles within a desk, any more granular could be inaccurate
because it is different for every company.  Admin support - answers the
phones and Commerical support runs the books in the back office.

Commodity Fundamentals - (1) Broker fees and Margin calls were added in the
overview, <<According to Berney Aucoin>> it was worth mentioning, but
wholesale is exempt from fees and taxes.  (2) Industrial, Retail and
Wholesale was added as an i.e., by consumption by consumer

Organizational Structure - (1) Communication - Inter/Intra department
communications were added into the Challenges of Managing Trading Function
and Trading System. Inter department communication (i.e., between
departments within organization) and Intra department communications (i.e.,
between roles on a desk after a trade/deal) (between desks, internal
communication between Marketer, Originator, Structurer and Trader, after a
trade and reconciling position reports)

Risk Management Inputs - Consequences within VaR guidelines was added to
""Trading outside of prescribed VaR guidelines

Swaps - Types of credit classifications was added to Credit Review under
Protecting Againist Loss.

The note for the references used was included on every topic framework -
*Note: Please note in your assignments when using additional resources
other than the BRM course material and your own knowledge. Please do not

Kirk -

Thank you for your timely feedback. Per our discussions, we have updated
all of the topic frameworks and attached them below. In addition, Monica
has sent you an email describing the changes she has made and explanations
around why some changes weren't made (SME's responses to your questions).

These updates, along with discussions with SMEs, took a total of one hour.

Michelle,

Here are my comments:

Section 9b-  It is my understanding that the Utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late February 2002.  Can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor, JC Evans.  I want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the ""Utility Lines"".  Also can we make the same distinction in the Utility Construction Escrow Agreement in Section C.

 Section 10-  Please change to Purchaser can extend closing for 3 successive periods of 30 days each for $10,000 per extension, not applicable to purchase price and non-refundable.

Also, I would prefer to sign the first amendment and the utility escrow documents at the same time since they reference each other.

I have sent Mike B. a copy of this email.

Thank you,

Phillip

Subject:	Zero Option


Phillip,


It will go along this lines: (Conservative)

*****************************************************
We pay ""0"" going forward
We have already played 300K in 3Q2001
Outstanding bill for $27,740 will hit excelr Q1, 2002

excelr and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally

We value excelrs SME time @ around 300K

Accenture will have the right to use it internally and modify the product at its will for internal & external use.

This arrangement will void 900K excelrs Revenue from Accenture

excelr would receive 0% royalty on all external sales.  I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. Also,  I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved.

***********************************************************************

If we do not reach the agreement: 1. Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate)  The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or
				 2. Continue ""as is"" with payment differed for 90 days or merger.

We are sending Accenture official notice as of tomorrow we have 10 business days to workout solution or terminate.	

Any comments or suggestions?


Regards,

Yevgeny

Importance:	High

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the excelr for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,

I need to get the contract for Galaxy and Grande executed today. In addition

If you elect me vice-president of Bishops Corner, Inc., I can take care of
all of the documents.  From a logistics standpoint this probably would be

Please let me know today if possible so I can send them to the lender.

Greg,

I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format.  The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.  But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.  

The asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.  

The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient.

Financing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.  What do you think could actually be achieved?  Can you put me in contact with a lender?

I will follow up with a phone call.

Thanks,

I reviewed your revised offer sheet.  I am OK with the effective income of $484K.  Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number.  The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on.  $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI.  I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon.  He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization.  See the attached spreadsheets.

I checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included.  So that reduces some of the savings.  Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home.  Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate.  

Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs.  I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do.  What are some other alternatives that would also be effective?  Radiant barrier?  More attic ventilation?  

Thank you for your help.

Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same
level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You
say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I
just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost
was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we
can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90
per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the
true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Richard,

I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with
SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can
decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints
completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with
8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.

I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that
is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of
$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within
that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built
house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a
radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same
energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to
a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.
That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional
costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?
Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help
me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from
Wink with Premier based on you reference.

Thank you for your help.

I had a couple of questions about the exchange.

1.	Can I place the replacement property into a limited partnership?
2.	The cash to be escrowed is approx. $650K.  At money market rates of 3.5% the interest in six months would be over $10K.  Will the funds be held in an interest bearing account and will I receive the interest?
3.	Should I fed ex all these documents to the title company?

Phillip,

It is looking like we will have to apply for a variance due to a set back
requirement when building over 10 feet tall.  Normal set back is 10 feet.
For every 3 ft higher you go, another 5 feet is added to the set back.  The
garage would be about 20 ft so we'd normally need to be back about 25 ft.
Currently, it's 13 feet.

I'm going to look into what's involved in getting on the agenda for a
variance.  I'll let you know what I find out.

Thanks,

Phillip,

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.

As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

Thanks,

Renee

Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of excelr Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of excelr Corp. common stock.""  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.

Subject:	Interface Design Update

Phillip,

The purpose of this e-mail is to explain the results of our discussions
with the technical team after our meeting with you. We need to get your
approval of the points listed below so that we can begin building the
application.

We can have the Position and P&L Reports show the results of the learner's
decisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward in
time with wrong answers. This will achieve our goal of giving the learners
""more rope"" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. In order to
achieve this, we will have the following constraints:
   The feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday's
   meeting. We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P&L and
   positions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous
   period. We will not, for example, be able to say things like ""In
   November, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdraw
   gas. What you should have done was...""
   We cannot save the P&L and position numbers. This means that if the
   learner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiences
   a computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need to
   start over at time period one.
   We cannot have the learner calculate P&L on storage costs,
   transportation costs, or hedging instruments. This is because the right
   answer and the available answer choices would have to depend on the
   decisions the learner has made. Now that the learner can go down any
   path he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, and
   the right answers are variable. I believe these tasks will be actually
   better if we don't have the learner calculate P&L because he has already
   calculated P&L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and
   conversion and arbitrage scenarios. Furthermore, the type of feedback we
   would have to give about specific P&L numbers will not flow well with
   the high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in this
   task.

We cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq framework
does not support the downloading of data into external applications. The
technical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our current
development budget. We can, however, do some calculations for the learner
on the screen. We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make the
mistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices.

If you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of day
Wednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of this
simulation. I would be happy to discuss these points with you; please let
me know if you would like to set up a meeting.

Thank you.
Mery

I received your email on the Killeen post office.  I am still having a tough time making the math work.  Can you prepare a spreadsheet that would show why the post office is such a good investment?  Maybe the assumptions I am making about interest rates, expenses, or value at the end of the lease are incorrect.

Phillip,

Hope your trip to Kerrville was worthwhile, and you had a chance to
check out the Heritage Building.

I am writing to tell you about another post office that has just come
back on the market...it's in Killeen, and was under contract for about
30 days. But one of my clients here who was in a 1031 exchange, and had
designated three post offices with us, could only actually buy two, so
today he released this one.

The Killeen post office (Harker Heights, a suburb) is one of the best we
have had in our inventory. It was built by a developer who is a friend
of ours and has been constructing POs for many years. She had to turn
down two other potential buyers recently because it was under contract.

I'm sure it will not last long. I have attached a flyer for you, and can
supply a copy of the lease too. If you are interested, do let me know
soon...we will need to act quickly! With best regards, Jim Wills

Phillip,

Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market ( approx.
$785,000) for your muni bond portfolio.  After the treasury comes due on Jan
31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have to worry
about your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the value of
your municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the bottom
line is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to keep in
mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless you close that
position you will probably get put those.

Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.  Also, if
there are any specifics that you want me to consider with your proposal such
as duration, maturity, etc.

          $785,000) for your muni bond portfolio.  After the treasury comes
     due
          on Jan
          31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have
     to
          worry
          about your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the
     value
          of
          your municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the
          bottom
          line is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to
     keep
          in
          mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless you
     close
          that
          position you will probably get put those.

          Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.
     Also,
          if
          there are any specifics that you want me to consider with your
          proposal such
          as duration, maturity, etc.

I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be =
on January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, t=
he application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression th=
at yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball. =20

On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful su=
ggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition f=
orward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space.=
  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new =
space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the existing=
 play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that is bord=
ered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for =
a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would not have to=
 add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bed=
room should be minor construction.  In the back you could slope the roof un=
til you were within the setback.  Then you could place a large dormer facin=
g the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.  From the driveway =
the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be =
brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition.  The kitche=
n and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would b=
e more shaded.  That is the west side of the house so that might not be a b=
ad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or di=
ning room would still be possible.  Personally, I think opening the dining =
room would be the better idea.

I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exp=
loring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest somethi=
ng in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me to try=
 and sketch out these ideas.

Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  excelr Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f excelr Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of excelr Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of excelr Corp common stock"".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of excelr Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1

Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=
es
Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13
Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658
10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866
Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792
Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10
Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =
administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=
.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =
a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =
 =20

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=
 same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=
er.

Phillip,

We spoke with Ina and scheduled a meeting with you for this Thursday from
10:00 - 11:00 in Room 3267 of the excelr Building.

The purpose of this meeting will be to get your sign-off on the feedback
approach for the simulation. We have outlined, in greater detail than you
and I have previously discussed, what we will provide feedback on and how
we will provide it for each scenario. It will be important for us to get
your input on Thursday because we need to finalize the feedback structure
before we can begin building the course.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at Ext. 5-6676.

Phillip, Carlos and I will try to respond to your request for a spreadsheet in the next day or two (I'll be at the home office in New Braunfels tomorrow). Meanwhile, I wanted to pass on some news...the Killeen post office probably is gone...I wrote a contract this morning that's now on its way to California for signature. Of course, if you wanted to submit one also, we can do it fairly quickly.

Incidentally, I had the price wrong on Killeen...it's $1,377,550, not $1,360,000.

HOWEVER!! Here's info about another new listing that may be ideal for you; it's a brand new post office at CANYON LAKE, just north of SA, and in a really ideal location to serve all the small communities that surround the reservoir. I have attached a flyer for you...this one, like Killeen, will not be around long because there are other brokers promoting it. I have talked to the postmaster, who tells me that almost all the boxes are gone, and the building is just now ready for occupancy. CPS is connecting over 2200 new power boxes a month in the area. It's really growing. Let me know what you think!!

With best regards, Jim Wills

Subject:	BRM Case & Options
Importance:	High

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the excelr for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,


Yevgeny Frolov

Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  

I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.

We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.  

I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.

Phillip,

Thank you for meeting with us today. I want to take a few minutes to
summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.

1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions you
gave us and move forward with this approach.

2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for Topics
reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for
sign-off on each topic.

3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to
incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We will
meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've
designed them so far and arrive at a solution. (I will send an e-mail
Monday with the room number.)

Have a good weekend.
Mery

Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating.  Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low.   Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith.  I don't believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at.  

Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time.  Thank you anyway.

Phillip,

Hope you are doing well this week, and have great plans for Turkeyday!!
We'll be with family in Austin, and kind of on a maiden voyage in our
'83 Avion that we're upgrading for camping!

Here's a look at three post offices in a slightly different manner.
Remember that the Roma one is about 5 years old, was a 15 yr lease
originally. The other two are new.

The Roma is like buying a savings account. It would be paid off in 10
years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonus
kicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease income
after it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cash
on cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma.

We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us know
if you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they will
last long. With best regards, Jim Wills

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=
 of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=
 bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a=
 deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=
ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=
us is reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=
ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=
nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double=
 dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=
islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=
e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=
e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=
g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=
hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =
breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=
e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=
ll be very difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=
e would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=
 Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =
$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=
l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=
 will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=
ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=
k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=
r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=
ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=
ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =
paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=
kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20
=20
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=
ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =
the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =
of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=
icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=
 to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=
rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=
ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=
he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=
 authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=
horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=
tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =
going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=
ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =
has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =
that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=
urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =
is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=
ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=
ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=
dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=
ier in the crisis.
=20
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=
he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=
gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=
o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=
igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=
s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=
es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=
ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=
suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=
tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=
en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=
ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=
assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=
 bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=
 the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Phillip,

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.

As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of excelr Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of excelr Corp. common stock.""  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.

I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook c=
lient will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve ma=
il via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is c=
onfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is m=
igrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your=
 web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and T=
o-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook cl=
ient is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OW=
A) for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connect=
ing to the excelr network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA availab=
le from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou=
-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You=
 will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your us=
er id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.=
  You will now be able to view your mailbox.

=09

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality betwee=
n the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the thin=
gs in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of t=
he functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.

Subject:	Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed   

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch.  

I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow and fax you a copy.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

I received the fax from Velasquez Masonry for $11,000.  He is proposing to do work on nine buildings.  From the memo from the city it sounds like 33,34,35, and 42 are the units that are at risk for collapse.  I don't want to pay for any discretionary work.  Also, I am still waiting for a quote from another mason.  

I am willing to offer $5,000 toward the repair and removal of rock in return for the release prepared by Jacques.  With regard to the utilities I want to have them transferred on Monday the 21st.  That will be one month that the utilities have been in my name.  It needs to be clear that I will net that month's electric and water against the $5,000 for the rock.

If she is willing to take the money for repairs we should be able to wrap things up immediately.  If not we will have to continue negotiations, but the utilities still need to be transferred.

Subject:	California Update 5/22/01

PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL

A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  Here are the main points from their conversation

1.	Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt

Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they hadn't already.""  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that ""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.""

He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are ""speculative"" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.""

2.	Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough

Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the market could handle.""  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.

3.	New Generator Construction

Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer.""",Non Abusive

Last night I spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track, Emil Carlsson and Thomas Considine.

Emil is currently tutoring at Hofstra after leaving an option trading position.  I would recommend bringing Emil to Houston for further interviews based on his technical knowledge.  The biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation.

Thomas was working as an equity market maker.  He is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise.  He is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades.  The trading track would be an excellent match for his desires.  I would also recommend bringing Thomas to Houston for further consideration.

Managing VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achieve this.  However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime.

I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended messages.  

I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation.

Please consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning.


Phillip

Tim Belden forwarded this message to me.  Can you please add Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst, Frank Ermis, and myself to your email distribution list.  We are all holding significant gas positions in California and are greatly affected by any gas or power developments withing the state.  

With regard to Socal's comments, do you have any additional information?  This is quite a 180 from the presentations that Socal has been giving to the CPUC and at other forums.  Until now they have been consistently stating that they will have plenty of gas.

Just heard this on an IEP call and wanted to pass it along.


SoCal gas has announced that it may have to curtail gas to power plants this summer.  SoCal Gas says it has to put gas in storage for winter and may not be able to do that and serve the power plants. Apparently, SoCal is shipping gas to Mexico at the same time. That will not look good to CA politicians.

The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20.  You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.

Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.  But I have not received payment on either.

Let's try and wrap this up this week.

Jeff - The Pew Center is sponsoring a  2-day workshop in conjunction with an annual summer program held by  the Energy Modeling Forum in Snowmass, CO.  We are hoping to  supplement EMF's list of economists and economic modelers who are  largely academics or with government labs or offices with folks from companies  who can help shed some light on how companies anticipate markets  will react to climate policies and the possible changes to prices and  availability of cleaner fuels such as natural gas.  A description of the  2-day program follows, and we can provide more information on the EMF meeting as  well if that's helpful.  I would be grateful if you can help identify  someone at excelr -- or otherwise -- who you feel could both contribute  to and benefit from the discussions with top economists and modelers.    If you need more information, please feel  free to call me or Leianne Clements (our economist) at the Pew Center number  listed below.  
 
Thanks for considering,
Vicki Arroyo Cochran
Director of Policy Analysis



   

The Economics of Natural Gas in the Climate Change  Debate (August 9-10, 2001)

Determining future demands and supply of natural gas (NG)  are important in determining climate policies since burning NG is relatively  ""cleaner"" than burning coal and oil.   A climate policy based on reducing the carbon content in fuels would  favor NG, along with other less-carbon intensive energy sources, thus  accelerating its demand.    However, economic models looking at the climate change issue show mixed  results on this issue; many models show the demand for NG increasing relative to  more ""dirty"" fuels while others show its demand decreasing at a rate faster than  oil (explained by NG demand being more responsive to a tax).  

The Pew Center has found that NG information is often  extrapolated from that of oil.   Without clear information on the true path of the NG sector,  policy-makers will be misinformed on how to address the climate change  problem.  The Pew Center will host a  conference in conjunction with the Energy Modeling Forum of Stanford University,  to gather leading experts on both the modeling and practical side of determining  natural gas issues.  A report will  be published summarizing the topics discussed in the  conference.

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were

that he had more units under construction that would be

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.

                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way.""

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 excelr Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

their offers at the back-end of their curves.

Roughly speaking, we are looking at a nominal 3750 MMBtu/d for 14 years from 
May 2010 on Elvis, and 3000 MMBtu/d on Cactus fromJune 2004 to April 2022.

Hey Phillip,
I received your note from Celeste.  I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator and 
need for you to fill out the attached Needs Assessment form before I can send 
you any resumes.  Also, would you be interested in the new class?  Analysts 
start with the business units on Aug. 3rd and Assoc. start on Aug. 28th.  We 
are starting to place the Associates and would like to see if you are 
interested.  Please let me know.  

Once I receive the Needs Assessment back (and you let me know if you can wait 
a month,) I will be happy to pull a couple of resumes for your review.  If 
you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: SM134 Proforma.xls


Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that the
construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our
standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.

Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.

It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.

I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are
$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3
bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached
garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.

year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  excelr VP/MD PRC 
requests that all excelr Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.excelr.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.excelr.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Subject: gas storage model


Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The excelr Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Subject: Thoughts on Presentation

It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The 
WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" 
generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.

On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal 
consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Let's talk.

Subject: Transport p&l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange 
to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.   
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your 
overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.
  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

To make a long story short.

Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal )  for 20 years (I know I 
did the deal)
on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the 
remaining life (now 18 years)

Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border  up to 250,000MMBtu a day 
and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day.

heat rate 10,500  SoCal Border plus $0.50.

I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it.

Subject: Re: SW Gas  

Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regarding 
asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to 
listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to 
protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality 
agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable 
us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder 
value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by 
reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a 
weather product.

As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other 
candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy 
to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our 
opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we 
implement our strategy in California.

Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset 
management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to 
systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

Subject: SW Gas

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are 
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Laird

Phillip -
I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation.  Saves on gas, 
pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  excelr provides bike racks 
in the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we 
could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the 
capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily 
basis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike 
at the designated outside racks.  

Keep Pedalling - Lee

As noted in my  last e-mail, the Ray Nixon expansion project in Colorado had 
the incorrect start date.  My last report showed an online date of May 2001; 
the actual anticipated online date is May 2003.
 
The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have 
access to in the WSCC:

 1) CA - siting office, plant contacts
 2) PNW - siting offices, plant contacts
 3) DSW - plant contacts, 1 siting office for Maricopa County Arizona.
 4) Colorado - Integrated Resource Plan

If anyone has additional information regarding new generation in the Desert 
Southwest or Colorado, such as plant phone numbers or contacts, I would 
greatly appreciate receiving this contact information.

I am planning to build a house in the Texas hillcountry.  The exterior will
be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back.  I am considering the
following features:  stained and scored concrete floors, an open
living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms
all upstairs.  I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly
country.  Can you help?

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Subject: 4-URGENT - OWA Please print this now.


Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the excelr network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@excelr.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general 
contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from 
the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within 
his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe 
he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from 
the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you 
please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email 
with comments.

Subject: Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed  

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed 
doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then 
among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large 
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which 
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 
41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story 
porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the 
front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not 
match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars

from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA

Subject: CAISO demand reduction

Phillip et al.,

I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in 
the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. 
March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand 
over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for 
temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates 
into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as 
compared with the previous year.

Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary 
reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other 
forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making 
total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple 
more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% 
decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the 
retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it 
is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last 
year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in 
Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation 
are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of 
meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general 
economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least 
make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.

Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area 
only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC 
(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO 
portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in 
demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As 
you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum 
smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at 
least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its 
wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several 
mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are 
sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly 
how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's 
economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of 
the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I 
think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already 
realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the 
non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the 
WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 
6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.

Here is the rentroll from last friday.  

The closing was to be this Thursday but it has been delayed until Friday 
April 20th.  If you can stay on until April 20th that would be helpful.  If 
you have made other commitments I understand.

I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on 
Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned 
I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get 
back in touch with you once he is finished.

Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager 
from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable 
with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp 
Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid 
for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am 
still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local 
relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final 
determination on unit mix and site plan.

The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows:

Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 
is outstanding.

Kohutek- $2,150 

Cuatro- $37,800


George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this 
amount.

The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 
appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this 
cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.

Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the  
sellers to be executed.

the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the 
floor plan.
He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and 
improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While 
he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification 
list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and 
speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday 
April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through

Subject: excelr Center Garage

The excelr Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new excelr Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.

9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron 
railings?

15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:

Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf 
(rentable)

What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% 
overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.

Why is profit only 4%? 

Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.

What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?

Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who 
receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?

Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage 
would only be 1.16.

Talk to you this afternoon.

Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of 
course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing 
contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still 
wants to receive this payment.

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs
 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the 
plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes 
across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for 
the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.

The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

just a note to let you know I will be out of the office Wed(3/21) until 
Thurs(3/23).  The kids are on spring break.  I will be in San Marcos and you 
can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com.

I was planning on stopping by to see Hugo Elizondo on Thursday to drop off a 
check and give him the green light to file for replatting.  What will change 
if we want to try and complete the project in phases.  Does he need to change 
what he is going to submit to the city.

I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning.  He was contracted to complete the 
soils study.  He says he will be done with his report by the end of the 
week.  I don't know who needs this report.  I told Gordon you might call to 
inquire about what work he performed. His number is 512-930-5832.

We spoke on the phone about most of these issues.

Phillip,

It looks as though we have most of the interim hardware upgrades in the 
building now, although we are still expecting a couple of components to 
arrive on Monday.

The Unix Team / DBA Team and Applications team expect to have a working test

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list
that I need further
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this

it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

Subject: Behind the Stage Two


FYI Western Price Survey Contacts

Cal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.

Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however.

More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He 
wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.  

We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to 
determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect 
work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation 
for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were 
proposing was unsupportable by the market.  

My version of a buyout is attached.

I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to 
foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  
Since their cost
and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I 
wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I 
want to respond to their offer asap.

Call me with your thoughts.

We haven't discussed how to proceed with the land.  The easiest treatment 
would be just to deed it to us.  However, it might be more
advantageous to convey the partnership.

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and

Subject:  Sagewood Phase II


George,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the 
Sagewood
Phase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted
pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 
500+
units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, 
this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to $8,868,000.

I have summarized our issues as follows:

1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:

     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment
     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR
     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475
     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417

2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit
turn over.

3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).

4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x 
debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.

5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.

6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:

     Land -                   $1,121,670
     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000
     Cash Equity              $1,419,268
     Total                    $2,955,938

7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage 
of
actual hard construction costs.

Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his 
excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the 
land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like 
to proceed and develop the property. 

 My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would 
also like to compare construction and development services between what you 
can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.  
Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to 
be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural 
work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is 
Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about 
either.

I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have
the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our
project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my
concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around
$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:

     Unit Cost, Site work, &
     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million

     Land                      1.15

     Interim Financing               .85

     Common Areas                     .80

     Total                         $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can
produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8
million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5
million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to 
discuss
alternatives.

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

Phillip -

George Richards asked that I drop you a line this morning to go over some
details on the San Marcos project.

1.  First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from
Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in
the transaction.

2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) 
will
be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the
acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer
signing off on the deal.

3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers
deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as
deferred profit has been acceptable.

Thanks,

There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N
total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Phillip,

I spoke with AMF's broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement.  They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,
and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.

AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.

The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,
and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the
details to Wayne McCoy.

I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week.  I will be checking my
messages.

 Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy 
Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this 
time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.  
She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

 Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. 
specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know 
what is an acceptable cash amount.

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is excelr accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different 
definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a 
superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third 
party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" 
fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be 
paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally 
the builders profit of 1.4 million.

Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out 
of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if 
they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition 
to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been 
in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and 
the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management 
fee is included.

George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will 
review and let you know what I think.

The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to 
the 3 out 4 approval process.

Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only 
true costs + 1.4 million.

this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and 
send it back.

Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.  I will probably send 
you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll.  Let's get this stuff clean today.

Subject: AEC Volumes at OPAL

Phillip these are the volumes that AEC is considering selling at Opal over 
the next five years.  The structure they are looking for is a firm physical 
sale at a NYMEX related price.  There is a very good chance that they will do 
this all with one party.  We are definitely being considered as that party.  
Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few 
producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River.

What would be your bid for this gas?

This should probably be researched further.  If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject 
to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  

Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes 
if you need to.





Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and 
refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form 
to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this 
information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.

It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with 
the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  He will know what I 
mean.

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  

The key business points are:

1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

Email or call  me later today.

Subject: re: book admin for Pipe/Gas daily option book  

When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

Thanks

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti 
was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.  
 Please call to discuss cash award.

Lucy,

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.

Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.

1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and 
repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor 
cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on 
repairs.

2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite 
manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has 
interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager 
that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a 
management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager 
onsite.

3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you 
want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.

4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure 
this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.

My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property 
definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.


Sales Price  705,000

1st Lien   473,500

2nd Lien  225,000

Transfer fee    7,500

Cash required   14,500


NOI   100,000

1st Lien    47,292

2nd Lien   23,694

Cash flow  29,014

Cash on cash  200%


These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then 
cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the 
additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years 
for a higher price.

Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.

Total                                             $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=

Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=

SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=
RN=20
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=
s.=20
Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=
t=20
would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=
ift=20
costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=
 the=20
revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =
in=20
the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights:
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=
=20
positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=
=20
its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=
=20
shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=
on=20
stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=
ve=20
and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
[there is no Section VII]
=20
VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=
=20
million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20
In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=

This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.

That is good news about Leander.  

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   
However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on.  

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this 
Friday.

Subject: Re: SM134  

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

Phillip:

It looks like a deal with the non gas fired QFs is iminent.  One for the gas 
generators is still quite a ways off.  

The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and reverting 
back to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give back 

I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate 
would be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any time 
soon.

I will keep you abreast of developments.

complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who 
switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the 
QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December 
(and maybe earlier).

PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment. 

SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on 2/2/01.

For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's 
purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be 
resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this 
occurred today.

Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  
Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is 
dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it.

This sounds like an opportunity to land a couple of analyst to fill the gaps 
in scheduling.  Remember their rotations last for one year.  Do you want to

Subject: Analyst Interviews Needed - 2/15/01


	

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining excelr this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a 
big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.

Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent

Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.

6329,allen-p/sent/510.,<7059082.1075855718041.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star
Date: 01/20/01 22:15

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, 
a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting,"" McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

""I was getting worried,"" he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider 
some changes.""

Subject: California Action Update 1-14-00

excelr has agreed that the key issue is to focus on solving the S-T buying 
needs.  Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the $ magnitude of the next 
few months.

TALKING POINTS:

Lot's of questions about DWR becoming the  vehicle for S-T buying and there 
is a significant legal risk for it becoming the vehicle.  WE DO NEED 
SOMETHING TO BRIDGE BEFORE WE PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS.
Huge and growing shortfall ($3.2B through March 31, 2001) 
The SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.
Bankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy

Michael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize 
a Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super 
Priority.

2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term

Sandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet 
S-T requirements of UDCs.  Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer 
to see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms.  ($3.5B by end of 
April).  Pat Boylston will develop ""public benefit"" language for options 
working with Mike Day.  He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or 
pgboylston@stoel.com.

3. Get Team to Sacramento

Get with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen).  Explain the 
magnitude of the problem.  Get Mike Day to help draft language.  

4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts

Steve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or 
thougths.  Probably of limited value.

5. Update List

Any new information on this should be communicated to the following people as 
soon as possible.  These people should update their respective business units.

 Any time tomorrow between 10 am and 1 pm would be good for looking at the

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There 
are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write 
something today.

what periods?

 
What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this 
right?  Has the deposit been made yet?

Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional comments/suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of 
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.  I have

 I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He

 I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I 
described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in 
San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a 
couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like 
to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not 
require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to 
structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has 
been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the 
equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this 
nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to 
permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be 
important to banks. 

 I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer 
email or fax his financial statement to you.

Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I 
have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out 
tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility 
connections?  Other rezoning costs?  

What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

13:18 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Cal-ISO Pays $10M To Avoid Rolling Blackouts
Wed -Sources
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator paid
about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and
still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the
state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISO's operation told
Dow Jones Newswires.
But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third
consecutive day.
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.
But that still wasn't enough juice.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as
a means of attracting additional electricity resources.
""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""
Dorinson said.
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay
Pwr Plant
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent
System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy
Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,
Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.
The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the
ISO.
The ISO manages grid reliability.
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling
blackouts.
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

(This article was originally published Wednesday)

   By Jessica Berthold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said
Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by
some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate
reasons.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public
Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power
plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection
of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday
morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron
Thomas said.
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives
returned Wednesday for a full inspection.

   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down
two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,
Thomas said.
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting.
""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""
Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's"" authority.
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday.
""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you
need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegy
spokesman Lynn Lednicky.
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired.
""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.

Subject: Westgate


Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
excelr Online (EOL), excelr's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is excelr's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Phillip

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Subject: Sagewood Town Homes


I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

Why am I not surprised ?

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make
everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have
some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when
they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think
that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth.

this next issue of The Last Straw focusses on lime... and to no one's

Master of Lime, 'Arry .

Those same spies/sneaks/sleuths tell me that the format of this
next issue is a departure from the norm and may be a Beeg Surprise
to some.

I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and
development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I
think will be interesting to the group.

I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   a
very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime
and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book
covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.

I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -
interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years
learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,
structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have
lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good
background information for sustainable builder folks.

Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.

for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.  H 20 call was 
trading for 55 on monday.  today it was 10/17.  the market's view of 
probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that 
has to be reflected in h/j.

The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in 
natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March 
and run out of gas.  The spread game is very different than playing crude.  
These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.  You know there

Susan Scott, Larry's risk manager, will compile and send you a spreadsheet of 
total p&l minus new deal p&l since June 1.   Can you review this data and 
compare it to the respective VAR numbers for these dates.  I think you will 
see the VAR numbers way overestimate his p&l volatility.

Subject: Re Larry May - REVISED


John,
I apologize for the delay in responding, I was in class today.
We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR.   It looks as if during 
the month of June, the book administor  loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but 
assigned multiple master deal ID's.  (the code is ""NG-OPT-XL-PRC"")
For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June: 
June 1st  $797 million dollars loss
June 2nd +192 million dollars made
June 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..)

This problem makes it impossible to backtest....

Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the 
allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily 
increasing your limit to $45 million.  This limit increase is in effect until 
July 26th.  The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution 
can be devised..... 

I hope this helps.
Thanks,
Frank

Just following up on two topics.
One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact 
his P&L is never close to that.  Can you check that his exotics book 
positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.

Second:  Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer 
term Vol problem until we change formulas?

John,

Thank you for your flexibility regarding the asian option we purchased from 
you (average Feb-Aug GD HH settle).  Unfortunately, our customer would like 
to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily 
is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday) 
- so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your 
offer.

John(s),

How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect 
to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the 
average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple 
count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the 
latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.

Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  
SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.

Regards,
Gary

Some of our food processing factories in the Midwest which have fuel switching

in
lieu of natural gas.  Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery.  One

the guys responsible for this move did a back of the envelope calculation and
found that at $8.00 / Dth NG prices it was even profitable to buy olive oil in

Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, excelr Online, offer a nearly 
identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I 
would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's 
happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the 
LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks, 
the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I 
still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals 
and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.  
The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.

Dear Mr. Arnold,

 It was nice to meet you yesterday at the
information session.  Thank you for the dinner last night.
I had a great time getting to know excelr and its people in
a more relaxed setting.

 During out conversation yesterday, I was confused
about a point you made. You stated that you spent most of
your time on the phone with Traders in New York.  When
you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards
excelr Online, or are you doing trading outside of excelr
Online?  I think the underlying question that I am asking,
is: Is excelr Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job,
or is it meant to bypass traders completely.

Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forward
to talking with you again when you come to campus for
interviews.

Cordially,

Adam

Let me know when will be good for both you and John on next Wednesday
afternoon. Right now only you and myself have been added into the NT group.
After the demo, if both of you think it is a great tool, then I am going to

have a comfort level with the quality of my work.  I think the analysis I've
given you has been quite accurate as to market turns and price behavior.  It
would be helpful if I had some idea of how you trade/view the market.  Are
you mainly day-trading or do you hold positions for several days/weeks?

John:

The price behavior of the past couple days has been  disappointing. My
short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and natural
appears to be waning at present. Volume on this rally is  poor,
particularly since yesterday was a decent day to the upside. The  market
appears to be using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels. If  we
are at these same price levels in another two weeks, that would be
extremely  bullish. Right here, the risk/reward to being long is not so
great.   Recommend a neutral stance short-term on natural. Bigger picture
is still  very bullish. However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of
what I would  call horizontal price action to set the stage for a big move

?
The price behavior of the past couple days has been  disappointing.? My 
short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and natural 
appears to be waning at present.? Volume on this rally is  poor, particularly 
since yesterday was a decent day to the upside.? The  market appears to be 
using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels.? If  we are at these same 
price levels in another two weeks, that would be extremely  bullish.? Right 
here, the risk/reward to being long is not so great.?  Recommend a neutral 
stance short-term on natural.? Bigger picture is still  very bullish.? 
However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of what I would  call horizontal 
price action to set the stage for a big move to the  upside.

John- 

What do you think of getting a direct mic from New York to Houston as soon as 
possible?  We had one at my last employer from NY to London which worked 
great.  You can tun it on or off but it allows us to communicate without 
getting on the darn phone - I am sure its a total annoyance to pick us up.

The steno is still a phone to me and its not recorded. 

We could keep it between you and Mike. 

We are getting a few more funds to trade now- some program guys among them 
who will need quicker execution.  I know you and Per have discussed the idea 
of them calling you direct but I think, for now, the mic is a better answer.  
I can sit down with you when I am down there to discuss and give you an 
update of who we are planning to trade with.

Best Rgds,
Caroline

I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  Bill 
Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is an 
extremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today as 
someone ""who thinks outside the box"".  Bill actually sat in a bar four years 
and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has been 
successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.  
As such he provides an informal consulting role to excelr.  He throws out 
ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointed 
out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally 
don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for 
excelr.  In return, I have agreed to have excelr intermediate his trades within 
reason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be 
considered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit risk 
exposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as an 
independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for 
someone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill not 
conducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitor 
his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he is 
at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade 
counterparty.

I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread 
option he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the 
trading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that 
excelr does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This 
was one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing 
models created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that 
they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental 
price limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, 
for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within 
variable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a 
correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously, 
we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this 
methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since 
been changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very 
few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.  

Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to 
excelr.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting 
credit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade 
considering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise.
Thanks,

Subject: PIRA Annual Seminar Preview

Hey JA:
I was at PIRA today and got a preview of their presenation on Oct 11-12 for  
their client seminars.
(Greg Shuttlesworth)
Summary:
They have turned a little bearish becuase
They believe that distillates will cap gas ( get some to graph HO, CL, NY 
No.6 1% and TZ6 Index  and NX3) the picture is very convincing
Supply is increasing at a faster pace (1Bcf/d more in Q4 and expect 
incremental 2 BCF/d next summer)
Canadian production is increasing
Deep water GOm is increasing
Lastly, Shallow water GOM is also improving after years of decline

Demand
modest in 01/02
more efficient gas turbine
economic moderation

Near term
Yes it looks a little ugly this winter
Possibility of shocks in the shoulder ( low storage and early summer heat in 
Apr-May 01)

Call me or write if you call for more details. I am also faxing you their 
fuel substitution slide---- it looks at up to 5 BCF/d being put back into the 
supply chain.

The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into

Subject: Stress Test

The below file shows the results of the two stress test requested.  Under the 
$7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price 
curves proportionally shifted.  Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the 
price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX 
volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly.


Key findings include:
$7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79%  
$9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% 

       

It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the 
financial desk actually decreased.  This would seem to imply that up to the 
seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces 
risk).  But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that 
the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and 
increasing VaR by 74%.  Does this make sense or is something else happening?

What do you mean?  I'm serious!

So what Fortune article?  I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that!  What the heck is a ""chief"" of natural gas
derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best
part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends
in
Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City
on
Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to
be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??
I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!

I wish I had a lot to pass along, but not much has changed on  my work.? All 
the analysis is still very bullish and expecting higher  levels.? I am 
receiving hourly ""9"" type strength patterns, which means the  up move must 
consistently continue from here.? Any drop under today's lows  is a negative 
for natural.? On my daily work, natural will see a new type  of strength 
pattern today.? It is not a ""9"" type topping pattern, but one  that normally

have done.  I believe you are one of those individuals.  I appreciate what 
you have done with EOL and the burden you have had to take on.  This 
especially hits home when I see what has happened to you P/L the last 3 
months.  You are expected to carry the world without having any NYMEX 
liquidity to cover your risk.  I would like to offer to transfer $30 million 
out of the Storage Book to the Price Book.  Without you and EOL I could never

A couple things about the limit orders:

1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open 
should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible.  
Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.  
Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading 
session unless specified otherwise.  

2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.  
When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 
increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the 
quantity to be 15,000.  

3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system 
saying error trade, price not available.

4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, 
without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a 
valuable feature.

clearing rate and getting access to financing.  This is a question I hope 
your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.

URGENT

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the excelr 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

Subject: data standards


Dear AEDC Member,

One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arena
is the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard.  This
standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic
developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and
examining data.  Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and
more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more
comparable than ever before.

A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to
see how the data standards can be made to work for you.  There are 25
tables in the standard presented in an excel format.  The tabs at the
bottom of the page will access the additional tables.

You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use
the services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into
a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for
the standards.  ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the
standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which
approach works best for you.

Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic
development profession.  They should be of particular advantage to the many
areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't
received the consideration they deserve.  The standards are a great way to
tell their story.

If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for
notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the
standards and their use.

What do you mean?  I'm serious!

So what Fortune article?  I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that!  What the heck is a ""chief"" of natural gas
derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends in
Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City on
Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??   I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!

Subject: Meeting to discuss 2001 direct expense plan

Hi John,

Since Jeff has left I am assuming that you will be responsible for the plan 
for your cost center - 105894.  Please correct me if I am wrong.

I have scheduled a meeting tomorrow at 4pm with you to discuss the 2001 
direct expense plan for Financial Gas trading.  I will have a schedule that 
details your 2000 plan, 2000 estimate based on the first 6 months of 2000 and 
a template for the 2001 plan.  

I will be mostly interested in getting the following information from you 
tomorrow:

1) Are you expecting an increase in headcount?  If so, what level of person?
2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001?
3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center?
4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want 
to plan for?
5) Are you expecting any promotions?
6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement 
agencies?  Would we need to plan relocation costs for them?
7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries?
8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should 
plan for?  If so, how much and where?
9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, 
monitors and software?
10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should 
plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.)

My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished 
before Paula Harris took over.  She will be coming to the meeting with me.  
Please let me know if you need any additional information prior to the 
meeting.

Thanks!
Suzanne

how to address the ICE issue.  His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we 
post 1/8 on ICE.  If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server 
automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.  If someone betters that to 2 bid, we 
immediately go 2.25 bid.  So we are always the best market on ICE so long as 
it is not inside our EOL 2-way.  Thus the only way our best market shows on 
ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market 
gets shown.  If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was 
that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.   Think about which 
system you like better.

Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will 
be implemented shortly.

I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing 
a product this week.  The purpose will be to communicate about the importance 
of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 
2-ways and killing the broker markets.  ",Non Abusive

Subject: ENA Fileplan Project

Ina, here is information concerning the scope and purpose of our project:

We are records and information management consultants from Millican & 
Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to 
formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we're 
taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each 
ENA organization's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually 
a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain 
this project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We'll then ask 
that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our 
working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with 
their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff.

There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project. 
excelr, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic 
records--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. 
Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention 
requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, 
once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility 
for it, and how long it must be maintained.

excelr has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an 
imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and 
then use the ""imaged"" document viewable from your computer as the working 
copy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to 
offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements. 

During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic 
records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. 
MSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we 
do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an 
interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions.

 If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call.  
Thank you.

wide as last year.  Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip.  
Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango.   if it 
couldn't do it this year....
A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve 
told them to do last bid week.  Obviously, more gas trying to come out than 
is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an 
excelr, to inject.  Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling 
it out in G.  When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, 
cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f.  Storage 
economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of 
winter.  Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways.  
Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong.  storage boys 
are withdrawing today and buying that.   bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it 
going to zero?

fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time

busy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you with
calls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have 
the

one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called 
impact
of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate 
at
all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon.
   also will be curious how these ""loan deals"" by pipes work ouut. man these
guys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cash
hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in 
the
back of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keep
that part of the curve very strong agree?

Subject: Reuters Story on E-Exchange


By Fiona O'Brien
   LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The head of the largest yet Internet
exchange for energy products said it will combine traditional anonymity
with transparency to give traders a better overview of market activity.
   The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based venture
initiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August
24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to go
live soon afterwards.
   While market transparency will increase as dealers used to
over-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, users
of the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, Jeffrey
Sprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview.
   ""As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals both
counterparties,"" he said. ""The real strength is that you (still) get the
ability to manage your own counterparties.
   ""You can list all of the people you want to do business with and put
in the credit terms under which you will do business.""
   This information will then be processed by what Sprecher called a
""giant matrix"" within the system.
   ""(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't sure
they have ever seen the entire market,"" he said.
   ""(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals you
can't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market.""
   Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currently
aware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase market
transparency, as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers who
fall outside their own trading criteria, Sprecher said.
   The exchange is expected to function in real time around the clock
and will be accessible via the public internet or a private network
connection.
   Initial liquidity will be provided by founder members BP Amoco
<BPA.L>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter <MWD.N>, Royal Dutch/Shell <RD.AS><SHEL.L>, Societe Generale
<SOGN.PA> and TotalfinaElf <TOTF.PA>.
   Shell runs the industry's largest international oil trading operation
and Goldman Sachs' J.Aron commodities arm last year was dominant
internationally in unregulated OTC oil derivatives.
   Late in July the original cast was joined by six gas and power
companies, American Electric Power <AEP.N,> Utilicorp's Aaquila Energy
<UCU.N,> Duke Energy <DUK.N,> El Paso Energy <EPG.N>, Reliant Energy
<REI.N> and Southern Company Energy Marketing <SO.N>.
   Sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact that
the founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and will
face additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment to
trade a minimum volume.

   TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARING
   As well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believes
trading over the Internet could boost trading profits.
""The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that a
paperless back office can really save a lot of money,"" he said.
   However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off given
that dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearing
systems, as they do in current OTC systems.
   Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties will
receive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through those
players' own risk management systems.
   But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its own
clearing system.
  ""No one really knows how at the moment,"" Sprecher said. ""There might
be some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now exists
peer to peer.""
  In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurred
except those associated with trading. Membership is open to any
commercial market participant.
   Each product will have its own published commission schedule, which
Sprecher assessed at ""slightly below the best prices someone would pay
in the voice broker business"".  ((London newsroom +44 20 7542 7930)

John,

As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street, 
whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was 
that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care 
whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we 
could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still 
will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to 
reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed 
transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I 
would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we 
deal with for obvious anonymity reasons. I would really appreciate your 
thoughts/concerns.

Planning to attend the Olympics in Sydney, Australia?

Here is a networking opportunity for our international IDRC visitors to 
experience some warm Aussie hospitality.

The Sydney Chapter would love to offer our international IDRC members an 
opportunity to combine the Olympics with a real Aussie Bush Barbeque in one 
of our National Parks close to Sydney.

The Chapter has set aside Thursday, 14 September 2000 for an IDRC 
International ""Wine & Wisdom"" event in the form of a Bush BBQ.  The time is 
4:00 - 6:00 pm for a BBQ, a little informal information sharing, and some 
warm Aussie hospitality.

Just let us know who you are, how we can contact you, your particular social 
or business interest, and we will be in touch with more detail.  It's then up 
to you!

Contact John Fox, IDRC Australia Regional Director, tel (612) 9977 0732,

FYI. I spoke with Steve. Seems like they have not been successful with plan 
A, i.e. to get their investors to give them authority to trade OTC as well as 
futures. They have moved on to plan B which is to take one of their domestic 
funds (approx. $500mm under mgt) off the floor (futures only) and into OTC 
trading. Still has the rating problem with excelr, but I am trying to get him 
to arrange a conference call with their CFO so I can discuss ways around it. 
He will try to do so this week. Mind you, I left it at this point the last

One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold 
front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In 
such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how 
Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures 
were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, 
and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position 
currently.  But in the winter that may change.
Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the 
assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter 
the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long 
cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side.   
While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the 
payout probabilities may look like the following:

20%  $ -.05
40%     $ -.02
20% $ 0
19% $ .03
1% $ 1

RAC is working on developing some ""canned"" stress tests regarding VaR.  For 
example, one test could be called ""hurricane"", were the prompt month is

Subject: VaR Methodology Change

Gentlemen,

Below is a plan of action for moving along with the VaR methodology change 
related to forward-forward volatility:

1. Finalize the methodology proposed (Research/Market Risk)

 - determine the time period used to calculated forward-forward vols vs. 
correlations (20 days vs. 60 days)
 - stabilize the calculation for curves and time periods where the curve does 
not change based on historical prices, implying volatility of 0%

2. Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of the 
memo attached) - John Lavorato and John Sherriff



3. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment 
(Research/IT)

4. Test the new methodology (Market Risk, Traders)

5. Migrate into production (Research/IT)

Please let me know if this is reasonable and meets everyone's expectations. 
Vlady.

By the version of EOL do you mean the new version of stack manager ? If you 
do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out 
today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that 
might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some 
serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign 
whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many 
things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, 
obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we 
thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should 
discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.

opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the 
winter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection 
season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those 
projections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to 
price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the 
equation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand 
(mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies 
will be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as 
to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a 
comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number 
indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.  
Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be 
a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting 
noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand 
equilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.  
If we get two low injections, watch out.

Subject: Market Opinion about AGA's


	

John,
I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears.  In the 
beginning of the season, AGA's were  very important in framing the bull 
case.  The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under 
stored.  I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change 
that expectation. 

However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of 
bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news.

At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come 
from the physical market and weather. 

I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.

Thanks,
Frank

Per Share


http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000711/tx_el_paso_2.html

Tuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern Time
Company Press Release
SOURCE: El Paso Energy Corporation
El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share
HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG
<http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) today
announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69,
an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings
per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share
of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding
for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted
earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second
quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million
in the year-ago period.
EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the
quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.
``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in
our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said
William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy
Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio
of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to
accelerate in the second quarter.''
For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share
increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first
six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding
non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515
million in the year-ago period.
Second Quarter Business Segment Results
The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the
second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year
and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas
and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating
significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced
trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale
customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's
off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed
to the record second-quarter performance.
The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT
to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher
realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the
reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for
the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and
$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from
the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day
and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.
The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,
nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due
primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with
the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March
2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion
Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.
Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas
Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared
with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost
savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3
TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement
filed in March.
The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million
compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in
Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's
investment in the Philippines.
Telecom Update
``We have made substantial progress in the development of our
telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A.
Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,
we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant
Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building
businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant
Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the
telecommunications marketplace.''
Quarterly Dividend
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on
the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October
2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September
1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled
to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000.
With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides
comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units:
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern
Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy
International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso
Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas
pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has
operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power
generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing,
and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso
Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging
the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion
and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the
completion of regulatory reviews. Visit El Paso Energy's web site at

    (a) Adjusted diluted earnings per common share represents diluted

        per share before the impact of certain non-recurring charges.
Second
        quarter 2000 results exclude merger related charges of $(46) million
        pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.  Second quarter 1999 results
        exclude merger related charges of  $(131) million pretax, or
        $(86) million aftertax, a gain on sale of assets of $19 million
        pretax, or $12 million aftertax, and the resolution of regulatory
        issues of $30 million pretax, or $20 million aftertax.  Year-to-date
        2000 results exclude the extraordinary gain on the sale of the East
        Tennessee and Sea Robin systems of $89 million aftertax and merger
        related charges of $(46) million pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.
        Year-to-date 1999 results exclude the cumulative effect of an
        accounting change of $(13) million aftertax, merger related charges
of
        $(135) million pretax, or $(86) million aftertax, ceiling test
charges
        of $(352) million pretax, or $(222) million aftertax, a gain on sale
        of assets of $19 million pretax, or $12 million aftertax, and the
        resolution of regulatory issues of $30 million pretax, or $19
million
        aftertax.
    (b) Proforma diluted loss per common share reflects reported diluted
        earnings per share but assumes dilution.  Reported diluted loss per
        common share does not assume dilution because dilution would reduce
        the amount of loss per share.

John,

Per your and Jeff's request, Research and Market Risk Groups have conducted 
an extensive analysis of the forward-forward vol methodology used in the 
Value-at-Risk calculation. 

We analyzed and compared two methodologies: 

 the existing methodology - based on forward (implied) vols
 an alternative methodology - based on historical vols

I would like to schedule about 30 minutes to walk you through the pros and 
cons of each methodology and get your input.

Subject: Re: using new FF vols  

Hi, John,
following up the discussion with you on Friday we talked with Risk Control 
people who are not excited to use that FF vol curve
you sent to me. Also in order to use your curves we would have to have them 
for all the locations.
The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol 
curves from historical data.
I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price 
curves for NG and 
all basis locations. I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor.
I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below. And here are the VAR numbers 
based on these curves:

     5/30/00  5/31/00
AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000
AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761
AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685
AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225

You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers. 
I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which 
would give more weight to recent data.
We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect 
backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor.

Tanya.

Subject: VaR

John,

We have  been working for the last few days on VaR related issues.
The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26
where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good
candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.

It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR 
system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative 
basis,
jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.
This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a 
big
jump in VaR.
This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look
at column D.

The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:

 a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the
                     code to review it.

 b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in
                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can 
propose, is to develop for
                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to 
review the fwd vol curve
                    before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  
it can be smoothed.

Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?


Vince

Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit

In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market 
conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas.  
Obviously, a deal this size would require excelr to wear a considerable amount 
of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very 
favorable.

Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all 
strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, 
making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 
cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller 
size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower 
delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a 
market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the 
money.  
Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way 
wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 
4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 
3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a 
strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate 
having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.

In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles 
struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for 
what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way excelr is trying 
to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier 
for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more 
sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if 
someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to 
call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a 
market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would 
anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just 
the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.",Non Abusive

Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others 
wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 
months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are 
amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will 
be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely 
implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.  
Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there.  
interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.  
definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until 
latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be 
unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one 
year ago and not a significant loss of demand.   
market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a 
very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low.  
Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been 
significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they 
are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some 
back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5

johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for
me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled 
all
the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas
therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was 
long
mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early
  flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a
flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained
aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.

   but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to 
mark
silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no
idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. 
any
great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.
   guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling 
dry
up??

Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was

John,

Several months ago we talked about the development of an option analysis tool 
that could be used to stress test positions under various scenarios as a 
supplement to our V@R analysis.  We have recently completed the project and 
would like to solicit your feedback on the report results.

We have selected your NG price position for April 4, 2000 (POST-ID  753650) 
for the initial analysis.  Attached in the excel file below you will find:

Analysis across the various forward months in your position 

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L


Summary of your Overall Position analysis

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L


Multiple Stress Analysis

The attached Word document demonstrates the multiple stress choices.  I have 
included a tab in the excel file that demonstrates the theoretical P/L 
resulting from shifts in both volatility and underlying price.  


Please note that the percentage changes across the column headers are not in 
absolute terms (for example, if the ATM volatility in a given month is 40% 
and the stress is -10% then the analysis is performed under a volatility 
scenario of 36%)









Thanks,

Rudi

replicate seasonal fundamentals.  There are convincing arguments as to why 
the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.  However, in the previous 
methodology they blew out.  For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 
while Cal 10 was .256.  
I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the 
summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months 
of July and August over time.

The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for 
the month as well as for the year.  These premiums are as follows:

Jan  -.008
Feb -.004
Mar -.001
Apr .002
May .003
Jun .004
Jul .004
Aug .004
Sep .003
Oct .002
Nov -.003
Dec -.006


These premiums start in Jan 2004
On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 
4/5 spread was marked at .0475.  
In the old methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965
Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044


In the new methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885
Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028

The only change in the formula is from:
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table
to
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month 
premium table

change them",Non Abusive

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

 In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A,
and so on.

 The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

 Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

 As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

IMPORTANT MEMO



Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing
broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Channel Inside FERC

Hi Eric,


Please find below the detailed terms of a possible deal that we have been
talking about during our phone conversation this morning.


Nature of deal : If the transaction takes place, Societe Generale would sell a
financial fixed price swap (flat price, not basis differential) to excelr. The
monthly settlement would be financial. There would not be any  exchange of
physical product.


Period of the deal : June 1st, 2001 to January 31st, 2021.


Used Reference :  Natural Gas-Houston Ship Channel Index Inside FERC , monthly
settlement.



Volumes of the financial swap transaction : Please find below the volumes 
given
month by month in MMBTU.

(See attached file: volumes-10-5-01-for-excelr.xls)

Since there is a tiny chance that the deal trades today, could you please 
check
if you have credit with SG for this period.
If not, could you find out how much time it approximately takes to get the
credit.
In terms of credit, SG is good with excelr for this period.

Thank you,

Alexander Werner

still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than 
expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand 
curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get 
close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get 
us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : 
hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but 
it will be a tougher move from here.

Subject: RISK Magazine Interview

John:
Kevin Foster with Risk Magazine is working on an article for the June issue 
regarding Gas Markets in the U.S. Basically, he is interested in excelr's 
opinion of:

1. Physical Supply/Demand of gas and how this is affecting financial trades
2. Where do we anticipate gas prices going over the summer?
3. The state of the industry--any major issues that may affect the market?

If this sounds like a story we would be interested in doing, please let me 
know and I will coordinate a short phone interview with Kevin Foster. I know 
it usually works best for your schedule to do this after 4pm, so please let 
me know if Tuesday after 4 would be good for you. 

Thanks for your help and please call me with any questions.

your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our

I hope your gas markets are moving nicely this week.  Its

But the most important thing has been my decision to join
excelr. At this point, I am looking around for a rotation,
and I have received a lot of advice pointing me towards
Gas/Power Structuring and RAC rotations.  I am wondering if
you know some people in these areas who might be looking
for analysts.  I have heard that traders work closely with
the structured finance and RAC guys, true?  If you have

To explain the P&L of -349,000  : 
We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing 
in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back 
rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.  
The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is 
pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and 
vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.

1- The above spreadsheet looks at HO-NG seasonally. It gives perspective on 
'normal relationships'. 

Things I need to clarify about your ng view
1- As gas plummets are you assuming that it regains all demand (industrial 
shutdowns and fuel switchers)?
2-What is your outlook for Nov-Mar 01 and Ap-oct 02
3- How does your view change with a normal, cold or warm winter ?
4- Is your view predicated on getting to 2.6  is easy and that world did not 
end this past winter a storage level of 2.6?
5- Do you believe that we will need to price some demand out again this 
winter?

John -

Yes, we received your check and forms.  The check has been deposited and the
forms have been processed.  The actual debits for hedge fund subscriptions
will begin on April 24th.

As for naked options, I believe we sent the paperwork for naked options to
you in February, but I don't believe we got it back.  Also, I'm concerned
about the margin requirements for naked options interfering with funds
available for the hedge fund subscriptions on April 24th.

I also have an ACCESS manager portfolio presentation for you to review
concerning the long-stock portion of your portfolio.  I'm thinking we could
knock out the paperwork, discuss protecting your liquidity for the hedge
funds vs. naked option margin requirements, and walk you through the ACCESS
manager proposal in about 30-45 minutes if you're available around 5 PM
tonight or tomorrow night.  With regards to the marginable equity for naked
options question, are the stocks at Fidelity held in joint name?

Thanks,
Mike

John,
We are trying to transfer your bloomberg account and need to know who within 
excelr North America can sign-off on this
contract.  Would that be you?  Or do you have a legal department that we 
should forward it to?  We initially changed the 
name on it and had it signed under excelr Corp which is where the majority of 
our Bloomberg contracts lie, but because
you can actually execute trades from the system that you are now using, it 
has to be under your departments name
and we need someone to sign the contract.

Let me know.

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not

John,

Sorry again...  my last 2 trades (EOL # 1112587 & 1112596 - I sell 1/2 day 
twice
@5.55 on May) were done again by mistake on US Gas Daily instead of NYMEX.

I have called your help desk to try to remove US Gas Daily from my NYMEX 
screen
which we cannot do so far unless I select each quote individually.  However 
this
would run the additional problem of not showing up new tenors you may 
introduce
over time.

Thank you and best regards,

Herve

Subject: RE: ng views + wager

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

Subject: SUNRISE CAPITAL

This is a program trader in San Diego with about 1 Billion in Capital.  They 
concentrate on front month trading- both swaps and options.  they are looking 
for liquidity and want to know:

1. size of the financial markets- what is the daily trading volume like?
2. bid/offer on size.. like 10,000 to start and then 5,000..1,000 - only for 
the front month on swaps and options?
3. what kind of size we have seen go through directly from anyone?

They want to know this for nat gas: I can talk to John and Mike on this
Rus- can you please get this on WTI, heat, and unleaded.

I want to try to get this to them today... we'll be getting a lot of these 
inquiries.

Also, they trade through Carr futures, Merrill, Morgan Stanley, and 
JPM/Chase.. What they want to do is trade with us and then we'll give-up the 
trades to the above counterparties.. in effect, we will not have any credit 
exposure..I can explain this in our meeting.

Thanks,
CA

Given the shape of the curve, my guess for incremental substitution is 
1.5Bcf/d for No2 oil.  
So for the period  May-Sep01 an extra 1.5Bcf/d will be put back into the 
system due to No2 oil usage.

2.  I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity.  
However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that 
Fidelity charges $147.50.  Is there any justification?

Hello all,

Over the last few weeks correspondence has been disseminated to you in 
regards to opportunities with the Guggenheim Museum in New York. We need to 
get a more accurate head count if we would like to have a private excelr event 
at the Frank Gehry Exhibit.  Tentatively, we have May 24th on hold and Frank 
Gehry has agreed to be in attendance, which is an added-value. The event 
would be a formal dinner with approximately 150-200 people, including excelr 
executives and their potential/existing customers.  Again, the attendance 
list is created through your requests but excelr Corporate covers the cost of 
the event (excluding travel arrangements).

We need to make a firm commitment to the Guggenheim by Monday.  Please let me 
know approximately how many people you would like to bring by tomorrow. Feel 
free to call me at 39056 or email me if you have any questions.

Thanks, Margaret

Did the Palestinians settle with the Israelis? No.  Did Dan Reeves settle

But Salomon Smith Barney and excelr have settled all the issues and have
agreed to the $50 million credit facility.  The documents are in Mary Cook's
capable hands and should be completed next week.

In addition, I hope that Jon Davis' cooling demand presentation on Wednesday

6935,arnold-j/_sent_mail/540.,<30199663.1075857652713.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  the 
question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of 
correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there are 
three big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochastic 
volatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend to 
have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and 
elasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when 
we are in that historical pricing environment.  however, moving to a 
different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wants 
to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the 
range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports a 
vol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a 
function of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at 
$4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.  thus there has been a tendency for all 
calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative 
skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off 
in a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test, regress 15 
day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation.  
second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution 
predicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market compares 
by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected 
distribution.  
third, is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players are 
bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance 
premium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral view 
towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly 
fashion, excelr can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more 
expensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak 
call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer 
fences.  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the 
fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade.  
if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.  hope this 
helps,
john

CSFB informed us today that their Appalachia hedging deal will likely happen 
in the next two weeks. The deal, in short, involves excelr buying an average 
volume of 11,500 mmBtu/d at TCO and 5,500 mmBtu/d at CNG for 12 years and 1 
month from Dec00. 
CSFB would like to get an idea of where the market is now. I've attached a 
spreadsheet that details the volumes, which decline with time. Could you 
please provide indicative prices, as of tonight's close. 
Thanks,

realizes that not only is it ok to get to 500-700 bcf in march but you

Warming Up To Green

BY ERIC ROSTON

Breathe in. Hold it. Hold it. O.K., now breathe out.

Unless you're outdoors in the midst of a cold snap, chances are you
can't see
your breath. And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin
box for the
right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs. Yet last November,
Murphy Oil
Corp., based in El Dorado, Ark., voluntarily shelled out several hundred
thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide, the same
stuff you
exhaled three sentences ago.

The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that
same autumn
day, half a world away, at the Hague. Thousands of policymakers and
scientists
from all over the world had gathered, hoping to dot the i's, cross the
zeds and
umlaut the o's on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. Framework
Convention on
Climate Change. The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission
of six
gases, CO2 among them, that are slowly--actually quickly in geological
terms--turning the earth into a hothouse. But no final accord was
reached.

In this context, Murphy's purchase of options on 210,000 metric tons of
carbon
(the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27,800 cars) from a
Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target
seems a
bit odd. The market for this kind of trade hasn't been established, and
there isn't
even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued. Indeed
there
isn't even unanimity on global warming itself.

Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an
environmental
transition. Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord, and global
bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissions
trading
system. But corporations, against the run of play, are beginning to
confront the
climate conundrum the best way they know how--as a business opportunity.
John Browne, CEO of BP Amoco, and Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, have both responded to the global-warming threat and
set up
internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto. Shell and BP have
vowed
to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each--nearly twice the Kyoto
target--Shell by 2002, BP by 2010. ""This isn't an act of altruism,"" says
Aidan
Murphy of Shell. ""It's a fundamental strategic issue for our business.""

And not theirs alone. A growing number of corporations, from IBM to your
neighborhood Kinko's, are reducing their greenhouse footprints. DuPont
is
pledging to knock its emissions 65% below 1990 levels by 2010. ""There's
been a
shift in the center of gravity in the U.S. corporate community since
Kyoto,"" says
Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""Now the view is that
climate
change is serious and we ought to do something about it.""

There are a few ways of doing that: invest in renewable energy sources
and ""cap
and trade"" emissions. That is, set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse-gas
emission
and let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their
allowance or
buy credits if they exceed permitted levels. The theory is that the
pursuit of
greenbacks will fuel greener business. ""Whenever you turn a pollution
cut into a
financial asset,"" says Joseph Goffman, an attorney at Environmental
Defense,
""people go out and make lots of pollution cuts.""

Even where green fervor is of a paler shade, corporations are viewing
the
potential for global regulation as a business risk they need to
consider. Witness
Claiborne Deming, Murphy's CEO, who doesn't see the science of global
warming
as solid enough yet to cry havoc. But Deming hears shareholders
clamoring and
the bureaucrats buzzing. Someone may ask his company to put more than a
quarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted
amount of CO2.

Breathe in. Hold it. You know the drill.

How much CO2 did you just exhale? Tricky question. Yet that's analogous
to the
one businesses are struggling with on a massive scale. Until they figure
it out,
companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine 1) how
you
buy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and 2)
how to do
so when no nation currently assigns a CO2 property right. ""It's risky as
hell,"" says
Deming.

Many groups are working to mitigate that risk. The World Resources
Institute
and others are road-testing a system that would make trading less risky
by
creating universal carbon-accounting practices. And four
companies--Arthur
Andersen, Credit Lyonnais, Natsource and Swiss Re--are developing an
exchange
where companies can trade, even in an embryonic market devoid of
legislative
standards. ""They're trying to nail down something that will be useful
under laws
that are not yet defined,"" says Garth Edward, a broker at Natsource, an
energy-trading firm.

The U.S. struggled to introduce a cap-and-trade system into the Kyoto
Protocol,
and achieved it by agreeing to a tough, many say impossible, target:
bringing
emissions 7% below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012. The irony of the
current
situation is that the Europeans, reluctant to accept trading at first,
have become
its champion; Britain next month will become the first country to embark
on a
national trading system.

Another practice, still hotly debated, is to assign credits for
sequestering carbon
in growing forests. Trees soak up limited amounts of CO2, release oxygen
into the
air and turn carbon into wood.

The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification, thus
setting up
an early environmental test for President Bush, who campaigned against
the
document. But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heard
preliminary
briefings on the matter as the U.S. preps for the next round of talks,
to be held in
Bonn in mid-July. Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in 1990,
when he
signed legislation that capped power plants' sulfur dioxide
emissions--the main
ingredient in acid rain--but allowed the plants to swap credits. And
Houston-based excelr, an energy trader whose chairman, Ken Lay, was a
prominent W. campaign adviser, stands to be a huge player in any such
market.
So if it's good for business, Bush the ex-businessman won't need that
big a push.

With him or without him, the monetization of carbon emissions--green for
greed's sake, if nothing else--is gaining momentum. So breathe easy. For
you, it's
still free. But for many companies, the carbon meter will be running
soon. In the
very near future, pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an
opportunity.

Subject: Re: FW: LNG Weekly Update

Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most 
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats 
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

Hey Buster,

Hope you had a great time in Cabo! I'm so jealous.  I need a vacation 
desperately!  

I'm trying to get a commitment on numbers from the different groups for the 
Guggenheim events.  Will you look over this document and tell me which ones 
you would like to attend and how many people you would like to bring to each? 
Of course, I need it ASAP -- what's new, right?!!

Thanks honey! Margaret

heffner how?
was pretty long coming into today just playing the range.  sold everything
on the way up.  will be s scale up seller probably through options.
certainly a short squeeze in trade today and i don;t think anything changes
tomorrow except maybe trade gets more confident in the short at the higher
level and if cash rejects higher prices.
will be buying lots of puts on the way up so i guess for me vol is not too
high.  i was short vol and covered it all this morn.  think we could be in
for some turbulence here

important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats 
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming 
online in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty close 
to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting 
limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In this 
framework, excelr would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be 
matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what 
everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the 
industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information 
advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first 
priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a 
counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that 
will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our 
competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL 
markets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if you 
want to discuss.

John

Redmond & I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with 
regard to EOL for UK gas.
We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing a 
considerably greater share of the market. (We estimate 50% now).
Spectron are getting about 20-30% of the number of trades we do. There are 
still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying 
brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing!  As far as we are 
concerned we only use SpectronLive on UK gas when we are  executing the 
strategy you mentioned below. 

Once again, thanks for your help
All the best,

Andy

Andy:
Enjoyed meeting with you.  

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that excelr is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.

Thank you so much for your time last week.

David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several 
issues helpful for our own market.
This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We 
trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from 
our side of the pond.

Lemuel Green, a flour mill owner, took the excess power from the water-turn=

the state. Before his death in 1930 he had built a utility that lit 56 Kans=

Kansas City's UtiliCorp United is perhaps the only fourth-generation=20
family-controlled electric utility in the country. Today the outfit, once=
=20
called Missouri Public Service, is headed by Lemuel Green's two=20
great-grandsons.
Richard Green, 46, took over as chief executive in 1985, three years after=
=20
his father's death. At the time Missouri Public Service served 200,000=20
customers in two states and had $245 million in revenues. Richard's brother=
=20
Robert, now 39, joined him three years later.=20
Standing pat was not an option. Deregulation was in the air, and the rules=

g=20
utilities in other parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.=20
UtiliCorp now serves 4 million customers in seven states and four countries=

More important, they veered off into other parts of the energy business. In=
=20
1986 they acquired gas properties from Peoples Natural Gas of Omaha and got=
 a=20
two-person gas-trading operation as part of the deal. That little trading=
=20
operation, now a subsidiary called Aquila, turned into something almost as=
=20
valuable as all the rest of the company, with its 4,500 megawatts of power=
=20
generated in some 22 power plants around the country.=20
""My brother and I received strong advice that we would never be able to be=
=20
competitive in this business,"" says Bob Green. Oh, yeah? Aquila has 1,100=
=20
employees and competes with the likes of Duke, Dynegy and excelr. According =
to=20
Natural Gas Week, Aquila was the fourth-largest power-and-gas marketer in t=
he=20
country last year. Aquila trades a host of other products as well-everythin=
g=20
from weather-condition hedges to bandwidth.=20
Problem: Trading operations require capital just as power plants do. The=20
solution, until now, has been what brother Bob calls ""our 'asset lite'=20
strategy. We want to control the capacity, not own it."" So Aquila may provi=
de=20

to=20

Aquila has not been a big player in the most profitable parts of the=20
business-taking on big risk in larger transactions, the way excelr and Dyneg=
y=20
do.=20
What to do? In mid-December UtiliCorp announced that it would offer 19.9% o=
f=20
Aquila to the public, raising capital while creating a market value for its=
=20
trading operation, just as competitors Constellation Energy and Southern=20
Company are doing. The hope is that the new entity will garner a multiple o=
f=20
20 to 45 times earnings. Then, if all were to go as planned, UtiliCorp woul=
d=20
spin off the rest of the operation in a tax-free distribution.=20
The timing looks good. Aquila has no material exposure in the California=20
market. Furthermore, the volatility in that market has been a bonanza for=
=20
many firms that trade power, including Aquila. Its trading subsidiary is th=
e=20
reason UtiliCorp's earnings were up 28% last year, to $206 million, on $29=
=20
billion in sales. UtiliCorp's shares doubled in the past year to $30.=20
But will the California crisis nonetheless poison the market for an Aquila=
=20
stock offering? It might. And UtiliCorp cannot afford to hold its breath in=
=20
the capital markets forever. Even with its ""asset-lite"" strategy, the compa=
ny=20
is far more leveraged than most utilities, with debt at 56% of capital,=20
versus the 50% norm for electric utilities. The offering is supposed to rai=
se=20
$425 million or so that could be used to pay down a bit of the parent's $2.=
9=20
billion in debt.=20
If Bob Green is walking a financial tightrope, you could never tell it by=
=20
talking to him. ""We see this company as our heritage,"" he says confidently.=
=20
This despite the fact that after seven equity offerings the family's share =
of=20
UtiliCorp is now 4%, down from 15% when Richard took over.=20
Might the Greens lose their heirloom in a takeover battle? They might, but=
=20
they might come out ahead anyway. Look at the family history. Lemuel sold=
=20
some of his utility assets for $6.6 million in 1927 and diversified into=20
California orange groves. The assets were resold to Samuel Insull, the=20
midwestern electricity magnate who came to a bad end when his pyramid of=20

excelr PROVIDES TRADING SERVICES TO MANX ELECTRICITY UNDER NETA
2001-03-08 08:43 (New York)


     (The following is a reformatted version of a press release issued
by excelr and received via electronic mail. The release was not confirmed
by the sender.)

excelr AND MANX ELECTRICITY ANNOUNCE POWER TRADING AGREEMENT

     London, March 8 -- excelr announced today that it has concluded a
long-term power trading agreement with the Manx Electricity Authority
(MEA), representing one of the first deals with an embedded generator
specifically designed for the New Electricity Trading Arrangements
(NETA). Under the agreement excelr will provide 24-hour trading services
to MEA under NETA in an innovative deal structured to maximise the value
of the electricity interconnector between the Isle of Man and UK
mainland.
     The =01A45 million interconnector runs between Bispham in Lancashire
and Douglas on the Isle of Man and is capable of carrying 40MW in each
direction. At 105km it is the longest AC interconnector cable in the
world.
     ""The development costs of the interconnector to the UK placed us
under pressure to put the link to the highest and best economic use and
we feel our relationship with excelr has accomplished this"" said Mike
Proffitt, Chief Executive of MEA.
     ""Our commitment to reducing the price of electricity on the Isle of
Man is firmly embedded in MEA's five year plan and our trading
partnership with excelr will greatly assist us in achieving this goal.""
     Richard Lewis, Managing Director of UK gas and power at excelr,
commented: ""This is a great transaction for both parties and fits well
into excelr's trading portfolio. MEA will benefit from excelr's expertise
as one of the UK's leading energy traders and will provide us with their
skills as operators of their generation plant and the interconnector. It
is significant in that we believe it is one of the first embedded
generation transactions specially tailored for the new trading
arrangements.""

Energy Trading Companies Pay Big for Weather Talent, WSJ Says
2001-03-08 06:47 (New York)


     Kansas City, March 8 (Bloomberg) -- The growth of energy
trading floors in the past several years has made meteorology a
glamour profession, even for forecasters who never even intended
to predict the weather on television, the Wall Street Journal
reported.
     Weather affects commodities trading and determines
electricity and natural gas supply and demand. That's why large
energy trading companies like excelr Corp., Williams Cos. and
UtiliCorp United Inc. recruit top weather-forecasting talent, the
paper said. Meteorologists with graduate degrees can command
$60,000 to $90,000 a year, far higher than the $33,000 the
National Weather Service pays a junior staffer.
     Energy traders use in-house weather forecasts to make quick
bets on the direction of electricity and natural gas prices. Fast
and accurate predictions can earn huge profits, the paper said.
     Many meteorologists say they like the pace and action of the
trading floor. While some in the profession work in broadcasting,
most meteorologists labor in the less visible and action-oriented
worlds of academia or government research, the paper said.

Subject: rebuttal

I am definitely a bigger fan of the crude complex for the next few months. 
Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas. Disagree about the demand 
destruction. 
? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- 
Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are 
underestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy 
is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is 
changing. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power 
demand as a result of  Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on 
what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying 
is  that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries 
will increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure 
in service industries.
? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock-- they couldn't have 
imagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly 
entrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories. 
Also they will  budget for these prices instead of $2.50
? See NG Week (3/5/01) Nevada power price hikes affecting casinos --- 
increases of 20%. When asked the implication for missed earnings and their 
plans for demand conservation, one casino official replied 'We're in the 
bright lights business'
? I don't believe the economic doom and gloom
 First of all no one wants a repeat of the 1990 recession ( which was much 
worse outside of the US) Every central bank in the G7 has or will cut rates 
this week. The US will follow suit or it will have a very expensive dollar 
which will blow exports. With all of the monetary slack, consumer credit will 
not tighten and thus buying will continue ( witness the lack of destruction 
in big ticket items purchasing). Heavy manufacturing is contracting but this 
is not everything. Productivity gains are strong. The economy is becoming 
more service based and traditional industrial barometers are not telling the 
whole story.
? Finally, I am London and it is not doom and gloom over here.

well there's my 2 cents.

   (Recasts, adds details)
    WASHINGTON, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. electricity demand
will grow by about 2.3 percent in 2001, down from 3.6 percent
growth last year due to the nation's slowing economy, the U.S.
Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday.
    Natural gas demand will also grow at about 2.3 percent this
year, the EIA said in its monthly supply and demand report.
Natural gas is the third most popular fuel used by U.S.
electricity generating plants after nuclear and coal.
    U.S. electricity demand in the first quarter of 2001 was
forecast at about 896 billion kilowatt hours (kwh), the EIA
said. That is slightly higher than the 895.8 billion kwh
forecast by the agency last month.
    For the entire winter heating season of October through
March, electricity demand was forecast to rise by 4.6 percent
from the previous year, the EIA said. The increase was driven
by the residential and commercial sectors, which were forecst
to be higher by 8 and 4 percent, respectively.
    More electricity plants were expected to switch from
natural gas back to fuel oil as oil prices drift lower, the
government report said.
    ""This trend is expected to continue through the first
quarter 2001,"" the EIA said. ""Although the favorable price
differential for oil relative to gas is expected to continue
through the forecast period, by the second half of 2001,
expected increases in gas-fired capacity are expected to keep
gas demand for power generation growing.""
    The monthly report also said that mild weather has eased
natural gas prices in California, but the state still faces gas
supply and deliverability bottlenecks affecting its electricity
plants.
    California has been fighting all winter to maintain

Utility Deregulation: Square Peg, Round Hole?
By JOSEPH KAHN

03/04/2001
The New York Times
Page 4, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON -- IN the forensic pursuit of what caused California's power 
failure, the Bush administration, the energy industry and many analysts have 
granted immunity to deregulation. 
Robert Shapiro, a managing director of excelr, the giant electricity marketer, 
says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other 
states, ''because California didn't really deregulate.'' Spencer Abraham, the 
new energy secretary, said Californians simply goofed, setting up a 
''dysfunctional'' system. It is the way California deregulated, not 
deregulation itself, that should take the blame, they say.
Yet some economists argue that California's troubles should inform the debate 
about whether -- not just how -- to deregulate. Among them is Alfred E. Kahn, 
the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free 
markets in the rail, trucking and airline industries. 
''I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets,'' Mr. Kahn said. 
He is still studying whether the design flaws in California's market explain 
the whole problem. But he is sounding a note of skepticism. 
''I've always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration,'' he 
said, referring to the old ways of allowing a single, heavily regulated power 
company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity. ''It may be one 
industry in which it works reasonably well.'' 
Mr. Kahn's comments might sound a little heretical. When this former Carter 
administration official was pushing deregulation, it was still a novel and 
politically risky concept. Today, getting government out of most businesses 
is part of the Washington economic canon. 
Moreover, few people believe that California, the first state to overhaul its 
electricity sector from top to bottom, has proved a good laboratory. To 
satisfy interest groups, the markets were designed in an awkward way, which 
soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went 
on the auction block. 
Among the quirks: The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power 
on daily spot markets, rather than arranging long-term contracts that might 
have allowed them to hedge risk. Consumer prices were also fixed, making it 
impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs. 
Paul L. Joskow, an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr. Kahn's, remains hopeful 
that the kinks can be ironed out. 
In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states, as well in as Britain, 
Chile and Argentina, all places that have restructured electricity markets, 
regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws. They have found 
ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and 
charge high prices, Mr. Joskow said. 
Regulators have also had to establish new markets that, through price 
signals, encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so 
that they have reserves for peak hours. During peak hours, shortages and 
price spikes can substantially raise average prices. 
''If they can do it in Britain, Chile and Argentina, then I think we can do 
it here,'' Mr. Joskow said. 
Still, he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices. 
Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one. Making sure 
Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another. 
''The political system must rise to the task,'' Mr. Joskow said, or the ''old 
way might be the best we can do.'' 
Mr. Kahn knows a bit about the old way. In the mid-1970's, he headed the New 
York Public Service Commission, which oversaw electricity and other regulated 
industries. The drawbacks were legendary. Local utilities had an endemic 
tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants, for which 
consumers paid through steady rate increases. Nearly everyone assumed that 
competition would slash prices. 
But though free markets do a better job managing rail, phone and airline 
prices, they have yet to match regulators' ability to juggle the complexities 
of electricity, Mr. Kahn said. 
Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep 
prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin. The vertical 
integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages, Mr. Kahn 
said. Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal 
ways. Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them 
to be built. ''The players all depended on one another,'' he said. 
California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts. But it has made 
people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for 
widgets.

The three have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, and 
the White House was expected to announce this week that it will send their 
names to the Senate for confirmation, the Washington Times reported, quoting 
unidentified sources.
Gordon R. England, 63, who retired recently from General Dynamics Corp., 
would be nominated as Navy secretary; James G. Roche, 61, a vice president at 
Northrop Grumman Corp., is the pick to head the Air Force; and the choice to 
head the Army is Thomas E. White, 57, a retired Army general and an executive 
with excelr Corp. White also once worked as an assistant to Colin L. Powell, 
Bush's secretary of State.

WASHINGTON--Three corporate executives are under consideration to lead the

The three men have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and 
the White House was expected to announce next week that it will send their 
names to the Senate for confirmation, The Washington Times reported 
yesterday, quoting unidentified sources.
But two Bush administration sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told 
The Associated Press that President Bush has not made a decision and that the 
nominations were not a certainty. 
The Times said Gordon England, 63, who retired last week as a vice president 
at General Dynamics, would be nominated as Navy secretary. England was 
responsible for the company's information systems and international programs. 
The newspaper also said James Roche, 61, a vice president at Northrop 
Grumman, was the pick to head the Air Force. Roche, a retired Navy captain, 
worked in the State Department during the Reagan administration and later was 
Democratic staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
The nominee for Army secretary was said to be Thomas White, 57, a retired 
Army general and an executive with excelr, a Houston-based energy company. 
White was executive assistant to Secretary of State Colin Powell when Powell 
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

excelr's Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain / Critics regard Kenneth Lay as 
deregulation opportunist

Kenneth Lay is one of the energy ""pirates"" accused by California's governor 
of fleecing consumers. As chairman of excelr Corp., the world's largest energy 
trader, Lay is arguably the biggest, baddest buccaneer of them all. 
But that's not how he wants to be seen. And he certainly doesn't like taking 
knocks from Gov. Gray Davis for having contributed to California's energy 
mess.
""It's very unfair,"" Lay said, his brown eyes taking on a puppy- dog quality. 
""He's trying to vilify us. But we didn't make the rules in California. We had 
nothing to do with creating the problem."" 
He gazed out from his plush, 50th-floor office. Houston's downtown 
skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky. 
""Everyone played by the rules,"" Lay said. ""Now our reputations are being 
maligned."" 
In a sense, he's right. The ultimate blame does rest with California 
policymakers for deregulating the state's electricity market in such a 
ham-fisted way that power giants like excelr cleaned up by exploiting 
loopholes in the system. 
But excelr was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process. 
""excelr and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for 
deregulation in California,"" said Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analyst 
in the Austin office of Consumers Union. ""A lot of what's happening in 
California was their idea."" 
Those familiar with the state's deregulation efforts said excelr was 
especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange, where 
wholesale power would be bought and sold, was separate from the Independent 
System Operator, which would oversee the electricity grid. 
""This fragmented the wholesale market, making it harder to monitor,"" said 
John Rozsa, an aide to state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, widely regarded as 
the godfather of California's bungled deregulation measures. 
""excelr isn't in the business of making markets work,"" Rozsa said. ""They're in 
the business of making a buck."" 
In an ironic twist, however, excelr now could play a pivotal role in helping 
the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing. The company has 
that much clout. 
SEEKING LAY'S BLESSING 
Thus, as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission 
lines of California's cash-strapped utilities, he didn't hesitate to call 
recently seeking Lay's personal blessing for the plan. 
This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had 
been castigated by Davis in the governor's State of the State speech. 
""I told him we couldn't support it,"" Lay said, a hint of a smile playing 
across his lips. ""It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid 
and, longer term, it could make things worse."" 
Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with excelr's big cheese? 
Simple: Davis will need the Bush administration's backing to make the 
power-line sale fly, and, many believe, there's no faster way to reach the 
new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron. 
Lay, 58, and his company have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various 
political campaigns in recent years, and he placed excelr's private jet at 
Bush's disposal during the presidential race. 
So great is Lay's influence with the president that some insist he is now 
serving effectively as shadow energy secretary, shaping U.S. energy policy as 
he sees fit. 
""There's a long history of excelr pulling the levers of its political 
relationships to get what it wants,"" said Craig McDonald, director of Texans 
for Public Justice, a watchdog group. ""What Ken Lay thinks energy policy 
should be isn't very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it 
should be."" 
ANOTHER VIEWPOINT 
Lay, of course, sees things differently. At the mere mention of his close 
rapport with the president, his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited 
the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months. 
""I have known the president and his family for many years,"" Lay said. ""I've 
been a strong supporter of his. I believe in him and I believe in his 
policies."" 
He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are 
""grossly exaggerated."" 
Still, it is striking that Bush's quick decision after taking office to limit 
federal assistance in solving California's energy woes virtually mirrored 
Lay's own thoughts on the situation. So, too, with the administration's 
hands-off approach to resolving the crisis. 
Whatever else, California's power woes have been very kind to excelr's bottom 
line. The company's revenues more than doubled to $101 billion last year. 
They haven't hurt Lay, either. According to company records, his pay package 
more than tripled last year to $18.3 million. 
Lay and other excelr officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company's 
California earnings from other worldwide business activities. But Lay 
conceded that excelr's profit from California energy deals last year was ""not 
inconsequential."" 
""We benefit from the volatility,"" he said. 
CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE 
That's putting it mildly. It could be said that California's energy mess was 
tailor-made for excelr, which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a 
captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are 
simultaneously soaring skyward. 
To understand why that is, one must look closely at excelr's complex business 
model. The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy 
deals. 
Lay, with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy 
regulator, set about completely reinventing excelr in 1985 after taking over 
what was then an unexceptional natural-gas pipeline operator. 
As he saw it, the real action was not in distribution or generation of 
energy, but in transacting lightning-fast deals wherever electricity or gas 
is needed -- treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time. 
excelr is now the leader in this fast-growing field, and uses that advantage 
to consolidate its position as the market-maker of choice for energy buyers 
and sellers throughout the country. 
It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually 
creative deals. For example, if electricity prices are down but natural gas 
prices up, excelr might cut a deal to meet a utility's power needs in return 
for taking possession of the gas required to run the utility's plants. 
excelr could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere, using part of the 
proceeds to purchase low-priced electricity from another provider, which it 
ships back to the original utility. 
""We do best in competitive markets,"" Lay said. ""These are sustainable 
markets."" 
TRADING FRENZY 
excelr's trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly 
young, mostly male employees scan banks of flat-panel displays in search of 
the best deals. Rock music blares from speakers, giving the scene an almost 
frat-party atmosphere. 
The company's trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an 
Internet-based bidding system, which logged 548,000 trades valued at $336 
billion, making excelr by far the world's single biggest e-commerce entity. 
Kevin Presto, who oversees excelr's East Coast power trades, called up the 
California electricity market on his computer. With a few quick mouse clicks, 
he showed that excelr at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at 
$250 per megawatt hour and selling it at $275. 
""Some days we're at $250, some days $300 and some days $500,"" Presto said 
over the steady thump-thump of the trading floor's rock 'n' roll soundtrack. 
""There's truly a problem out there."" 
This is a recurring theme among excelr officials: California's electricity 
market is broken and excelr would prefer it if things just settled down. As 
Lay himself put it, ""The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace."" 
In reality, California's dysfunctional marketplace means excelr isn't just 
making piles of money, it's seeing profits both coming and going. 
LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA 
The company's energy services division, which handles the complete energy 
needs of large institutions, counts among its clients the University of 
California and California State school systems, Oakland's Clorox Co., and 
even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park. 
excelr purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market 
values. At the same time, excelr sells power to PG&E at sky-high wholesale 
levels. 
In other words, excelr is buying back its own electricity from PG&E for just a 
fraction of the price it charges the utility. 
""These guys are the pariahs of the power system,"" said Nettie Hoge, executive 
director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ""Why do we need 
middlemen? They don't do anything except mark up the cost."" 
To be fair, energy marketers such as excelr can help stabilize an efficient 
marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers. 
This has proven the case in Pennsylvania, where excelr actively trades among 
about 200 market participants. 
But in an inefficient market such as California, a company like excelr can 
easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state's ill-conceived 
regulatory framework. 
Sylvester Turner, a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state 
committee that oversees Texas utilities, said he can't blame excelr and other 
power companies for pursuing profits in California. 
""California set up some bad rules, and these companies played by the rules 
California set up,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, they will behave to 
enhance their bottom lines."" 
But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next 
year, Turner said he has learned from California's experience -- and is 
taking steps to prevent Texas' power giants from shaking down local 
consumers. 
LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE 
He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission 
more authority in cracking down on market abuses. The power companies are 
fighting the legislation as hard as they can. 
Not least among Turner's worries is that Texas will see what California 
officials believe happened in their state: A deliberate withholding of power 
by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher. 
""I have that concern,"" he said. ""I don't necessarily take these companies at 
their word."" 
For his part, Lay insists that excelr has never deliberately manipulated 
electricity prices. 
""I don't know of any of that,"" he said. ""It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories."" 
As a sign of excelr's commitment to solving California's energy troubles, Lay 
said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating long-term power 
contracts on behalf of utilities. 
So how many contracts has excelr signed? 
Suddenly, the hurt, puppyish expression vanished from Lay's face, and a 
harder, more steely look glinted from his eyes. 
""None,"" he said. ""We won't be signing until we're certain about recovering 
our costs."" 
Consider this a shot across California's bow.

excelr boss says he's not to blame for profits in energy crisis

03/04/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Yes, his business has profited handsomely from 
California's energy crisis, but excelr Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay says he 
shouldn't be a scapegoat in California's energy crisis. 
That hasn't swayed Gov. Gray Davis, who has skewered energy companies such as 
Houston-based excelr for selling expensive power to California.
""Never again can we allow out-of-state profiteers to hold Californians 
hostage,"" Davis warned in his State of the State address. 
More recently, however, Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state 
looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities. 
""I told him we couldn't support it,"" Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in 
an interview at his Houston office. ""It will lead to an even less efficient 
transmission grid and, longer term, it could make things worse."" 
Lay is not just any private-sector energy czar - excelr Corp. is the world's 
largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush. Lay 
and his corporation have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various 
political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of excelr's 
private jet during the presidential race. 
But Lay said it's economics, not politics, that matter in California's energy 
crisis. And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed out-of-state energy 
brokers for the protracted problems. 
""We didn't make the rules in California,"" Lay said. ""We had nothing to do 
with creating the problem."" 
The problem, many analysts agree, began with the state's deregulation of the 
power industry in 1996. excelr encouraged deregulation, and the state's 
ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation. 
excelr's stock jumped 86 percent in 2000 and its revenues more than doubled to 
$101 billion. Lay, 58, was compensated accordingly - he received nearly $16 
million in stock and cash beyond his $1.3 million salary last year, compared 
with less than $4 million in bonuses in 1999. 
Lay refused to say how much excelr has made off California's crisis, though he 
conceded the profit was ""not inconsequential."" 
""We benefit from the volatility,"" said Lay, who took over excelr in 1985 and 
has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of 
electricity as a commodity. 
But Lay rejected suggestions that excelr has manipulated prices upward by 
insisting California pay dearly for last-minute power that has helped keep 
the lights on in recent months. 
""I don't know of any of that,"" he said. ""It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories.""

The Stadium Curse? / Some stocks swoon after arena deals
Kathleen Pender

03/04/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
B1
(Copyright 2001)

Is buying the name of a big-league stadium the kiss of death for a company, 
or does it only seem that way? 
From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field 
outside Boston, the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies 
whose stocks have been sacked.
The Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens play in a stadium named after 
PSINet, whose stock has fallen 92 percent to $1.25 a share since it bought 
naming rights. 
The problem names are not all tech. 
The owners of the TWA Dome in St. Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are 
looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt. 
TWA is an airline. Pro Player was part of underwear-maker Fruit of the Loom. 
The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if 
Edison International, parent of electric utility Southern California Edison, 
runs out of juice. 
Of course, these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens 
or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a 
ballpark or arena. 
In fact, many were at their peak. 
Which begs the question: Should investors get worried when a company in which 
they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights? 
Brian Pears, head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management, wonders if 
companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the ""Sports Illustrated 
curse."" It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI 
magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle. 
Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon: Amazon.com Chief 
Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazine's 1999 person of the 
year just before his company's stock price tanked. 
Don Hinchey, who advises buyers and sellers in naming-rights deals, doesn't 
think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals. 
""You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming 
rights sponsorship, but you can't necessarily say it corresponds with a peak 
in its business,"" says Hinchey, director of creative services for the Bonham 
Group in Denver. 
TRACKING NAMING FIRMS 
To find out if Hinchey is right, I tracked the stock market performance of 
publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to 47 big-league 
sports venues in North America. 
I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies, including 
Miller Park in Milwaukee (Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris) and Pac 
Bell Park in San Francisco (Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications, 
which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio). 
I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals 
are, after all, marketing endeavors. The announcement of a deal generates 
tons of publicity, which is considered positive, even if the publicity is 
negative and even if the stadium won't open for several years. 
Then I compared each company's stock market performance with the Standard & 
Poor's 500 index during the same period. 
The bottom line: 29 of the 47 companies that bought stadium or arena names 
are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced, 
according to data from FactSet Research Systems. (Two companies each bought 
two names and were counted twice.) 
But -- and this is a big but -- only 13 of them beat the S&P 500 during the 
period since their respective deals were announced. 
So buying a stadium name might not be a curse, but it's no guarantee the 
company will beat the market. 
WINNERS, LOSERS 
The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide 
variety of industries. 
The biggest winner is Qualcomm, a wireless telecommunications company. 
Although its stock is down 65 percent from its peak, it's still up 746 
percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium. 
The next-biggest winners include Target (discount stores), Ericsson (telecom 
equipment), Coors (beer), Fleet Financial (banking), Pepsi (soft drinks) and 
excelr (energy). 
The biggest losers are TWA, PSINet (Internet service provider), CMGI 
(Internet incubator), Savvis Communications (telecom services) and Network 
Associates (network security software). 
Network Associates' stock peaked about three months after it bought naming 
rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September 1998. Since then, it has suffered 
a string of setbacks. After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned 
its accounting practices, it restated its financial results for 1997 and 
1998. Its CEO resigned in December. 
Network Associates is paying slightly more than $1 million per year for the 
coliseum name. It can get out of its 10-year deal after five years. 
The company ""has been paying us,"" says Deena McClain, general counsel with 
the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority. ""We haven't had any 
discussions with them"" about changing the contract. 
Most naming-rights contracts have ""out clauses that allow the parties to 
extricate themselves if they want, can or need to in the event of financial 
difficulties or if a team moves,"" says Hinchey. 
Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser, stadium owners may 
benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early. 
That's because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid- 1990s, 
when $1 million a year -- give or take -- was average. 
In 1999, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to be named home of 
the Washington Redskins. 
In 2000, CMGI agreed to pay $114 million over 15 years to have its name on 
the new home of the New England Patriots. It's questionable what kind of 
shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year. 
The ""10-gallon hat of naming rights deals,"" says Hinchey, is in Houston, 
where Reliant Energy will pay $300 million over 32 years to name the 
Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself. 
Some customers of Reliant's utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal 
was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates. 
Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a 
stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends. 
But Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues, says, ""you have to 
look at the (stadium) purchase in light of total marketing budget. It sounds 
like big money, but frequently it's over 20 to 30 years. If you take out 
things the company might buy anyway, like tickets and luxury suites, it's 
small potatoes."" 
WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH 
The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game 
is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print. 
""This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding,"" says Jennifer 
Keavney, a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal. 
She says the cost of her deal, about $1 million a year, ""won't even buy you a 
Super Bowl ad. It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised 
football game, maybe."" 
The Coliseum, perched beside Interstate 880, also acts like a giant billboard 
for the company, which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports. 
Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes; on-site 
exposure through signage and kiosks; premium nights when the sponsor might 
offer samples at the park; and inclusion in programs, tickets and flyers. 
Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name 
because they sell consumer products or services. 
But not always. 
3Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to 
Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1995. 
""It was a good move for them,"" says Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from 
Sports Venues. ""They got the employees they were looking for, the visibility 
they were looking for. At the time, they were a player in a crowded field, 
and they wanted to look like a fun place to work."" 
Last April, 3Com extended its original 4-year contract for two more years. 
The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility 
will be a loser. 
""Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand, their sales and 
hospitality efforts. Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not 
performing well,"" Hinchey says. ""But corporations realize the team's success 
on the field fluctuates. It could be a champion one year, next year in the 
dumps."" 
The same can be said about the corporate sponsors, which is something stadium 
owners -- be they taxpayers or business tycoons -- must realize when they 
sell a name.

7035,arnold-j/_sent_mail/630.,<31307130.1075857655193.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"so according to your analysis, had we been at $2.5 gas and we were not 
bordering on a recession, we would have had the highest AGA number of 
recorded history for this week, last week, or next week by 15 bcf?  seems a 
little far fetched to me.  Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have 
had 4.5 bcf a day more demand.  that includes commercial residential 
industrial switching processing...    
as far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was 
extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be 
running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 
5% still and hydro way down.  every molecule that can will flow west from 
waha this summer versus little last year.  east power prices really havent 
reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where 
gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.  some concern of 
more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.  we're trying to build 
the stack now to estimate.  
frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.  will 
continue coming back.  a little concerned about 2 oil prices.  bordering 
right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 
100,000 last week as gas got to parity.  
let me look into inj capability.  definitely bigger when field is empty from 
engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen 
demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts.
bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.  really 
inactive.
to clarify, not raging bull.  i like everybody want to see what the inj 
numbers in april look like.  nobody putting a position on until that starts 
to clarify.  just think that hedging demand is making market a little short 
right now making next move up more likely.  would be scale up seller though
not really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.  doesnt make any sense.  
however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to 
great in my opinion to keep spread there.  must close one way or the other.  
notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday?
in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.  50 
cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand.  
market needs to see some big stg numbers first.   
i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads.  
Jan 4/3.5 look great to me.  if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last 
year's early weather, bombs away.

this doesnt allow for new generation demand-which is unclear cuz it requires
power px, also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient,
weather of course. but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak in
july-shud be marginal in apr-jun
   if you notice im not alot diff than your guys-4.6 demand destruction is
implied but im including a factor for R/C energy conservation-ie poor guys 
like
me turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will be
less factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&d swing will
be closer to 5 bcf apr-jun, if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think
we'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner
     now rember the 7.4 is vs gas at sub 6.00 ie february which is approx 
where
we are today
    all that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i consider
extraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occured
before-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ie
liquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel. some
ammonia/fert prod  has come back as well. but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/d
industrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as mucha
unction of an economic slowdown.
    anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of your 
big
fund customers(ospraie). we'll see.  is collins bullish as well-he seems 
quieter
in the mkt lately.
  heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection is
on a weekly basis? we sud test it...in other words if the max is say 105 then
means the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi and
be unable to inject all the gas available? thots
    also, you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ct
discount lately daily vs next month futs? why not 5 or 30 cts? i dont get it 
bt
wondering if its transportation or storage cost related.
  have a good weekdn my man

i think you are done with hhd/cdd stuff -ie did you complete the cdds vs
utilites demand? also monthly hdds vs residential and commercial
demand?(combined)?, cdds vs total stock change??
 if all these are done add them to the summary sheet in usable formula 
form-ill
show you what i mean

then we start our price data base from bloom berg

check this out-using the regression you did for nov-march 99/00 came to a draw
of 155 with 195  gw hdds, i decreased the draw by the amount i beleive is the 
y
on y supply demand swing. ie 1.5 bcf prod

That's saying that had gas been at $2.5, the AGA for the week would have been 
151.  Look at the AGA history for last week, this week and next week.

   94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 
3rd week of Feb  -64 -46 -64 -63 -77 -97 -136 -81
4th week of Feb  -132 -118 -62 -76 -47 -128 -74 -101 
1st week of Mar  -27 -132 -118 -57 -54 -69 -37 ??

Do you really think the # would have been 151 with no demand destruction?  It 
wasn't even really cold.  That would have been the highest AGA # of the three 
weeks by 15 bcf.  
Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d.  Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages 
3.5-4 bcf/d. That's just destruction and does not include new production, if 
any.  Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half of 
Feb.  Assuming that gets to equilibrium:  2 bcf/d demand destruction, 2 bcf/d 
more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand.  Start with a 400 b 
deficit and 200 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in 
current price environment.   I think we are fairly priced fundamentally, but 
with huge customer imbalance for hedging from buy side, surprises in the 
market right now are to the upside in my view.  Course hard to imagine $6 for 
J.   Just sell vol.

of Jan.  The price level was $9.  Of course there is a lag.  Let's make up
a lag time...say one month.   On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70.  Probably a
similar lag on the way down.  Cash is $5.20 today.  How much lost demand
will there be in a month if we're still $5.2?   million dollar question if

Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the
risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and
generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in
price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching,
full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric
generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around
1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2
bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start
really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about
recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not

march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a
month ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but
here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day
y on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will
effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan
for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in
the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than
heat. i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top
of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon
and ill
keep you posted.

full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric
generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around
1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not

march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a
month ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but
here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day
y on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will
effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan
for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in
the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than
heat. i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top
of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon

John -

I completely understand your point of view.  PaineWebber knows affluent
investors such as yourself want access to alternative investments such as
private equity and hedge funds.  Our group has also found that high net
worth individuals prefer a consultative relationship where we help you
structure a complete asset allocation based on your objectives.  We then
provide you with access to, and help you select, third-party institutional
money managers to make the day-to-day investment decisions.  We also provide
the ongoing performance monitoring of those managers, including correlations
to the appropriate indices.

I believe you will find our approach to be appreciably different from your
previous contacts with financial advisors, where you have felt the advisor
was 'pushing' a house fund or stock du jour.  If your schedule permits, I
would like to meet with you on Thursday afternoon to discuss this in more
detail.  How does 4 PM sound?

- Mike

Michael:
Thanks for putting the paperwork together.

I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment
opportunities that I don't have access to now.  Most of my contact with
financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual
fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass
off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.  The above
services provide no value to me personally.  If you can present
opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other
ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd
listen.

Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to
really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range
bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option
premium.
I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE
and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I
was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order
to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look
into that for me.

I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an
opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be
in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not
sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're
interested.

> end of the traditional withdrawal season.
> 2. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production should rise 3.0-5.0% this
> year, largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency, or
> production added per rig.
> 3. Nonetheless, under most scenarios, incorporating numerous other

I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment 
opportunities that I don't have access to now.  Most of my contact with 
financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual 
fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass 
off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.  The above 
services provide no value to me personally.  If you can present opportunities 
such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other ideas with strong 
growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd listen.

We'll get the paperwork together and sent to you for naked options.  At some

perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the markets close?

Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to
really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range
bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option
premium.
I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE
and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I
was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order
to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look

I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an
opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be
in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not
sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're
interested.

Enjoyed meeting with you.  

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that excelr is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.

John,

Looks like IT has decided not to install Internet Explorer 5.5 after all.  
The program is ready to go as soon as that is installed.  Do you want to put 
some pressure on them, or would you rather wait to see if they can fix it to 
work on IE 5.0?  You have 5.5 by the way, so I'm not quite sure what the 
problem is.

We are not good to go here.  These are high profile traders and I do not want

Fangming to resolve whatever the problem is with IE5 first and go from there.

All,
As John suggested, I have contacted the Microsoft Expert on the IE 5.0/5.5 
issue early this morning. We actually had a conversition over the phone. I 
also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything 
from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this 
browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their 
PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really 
not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is 
ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. 

Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard 
application. 

Thanks,

Fangming

gonna keep a huge premium in whats left of the winter strip vs summer, and 
they
shud. cash loan deals have to keep hedged lenght in mar there fore makes em

This morning's 6-10 day forecast models are showing somewhat better
agreement.  All three models move the main cold trough axis to the Great
Lakes area by the last half of the period.  This shift allows for cold
Polar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states by
days 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).  The Canadian and
European continue more troughing in the southern branch in the
Southwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continued
ridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keeping
them warmer and away from the cold.  The American eliminates this
southern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian
breaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold
weather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period.  The European appears
to hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases,
the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period.
All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada
with a plentiful supply of strong, cold air.

More details, including early information from the ensembles, will be
available with the 6:30am ET release.

put it to you this way completely between you and me. i have every expectation

suggestions that this new deal cud be better cuz of the guarantees + bonus. i
dont know yet, hasnt been offered or even discussed directly. but if it does 
and
its very good they gonna need a ngas guy in houston. i think we could put

Subject:  Re: v/x





i actually started writing this on thursday.  got distracted and left late
morning to go to Vail.  Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point
on v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily
trade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes
equilibrium between hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k
cash will average 3 cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet
that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get
there k/m=3.  The same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will
be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last
year.  But cal 2 will lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are
selling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling
their customers that cal 2 will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z
spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out.  After this winter, who in there
right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again.  my thought is that the primary
juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure.  i'm a
seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.  Not much in it either way though.

the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from 
December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from 
roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 
17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the 
producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with 
more details. 

There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to 
clarify. 

First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like 
payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both 
the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the 
December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment 
would take place on February 15, 2000. 

Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from excelr Corp. 
Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and 
Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we 
would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from excelr 
Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. 
(CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from excelr Corp. for a deal they've 
done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue). 

 There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with 
the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with 
excelrCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. 
However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this 
transaction.

CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split 
it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting 
with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. 
Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end 
of this week. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Regards,
Russ

I would like to invite you to a meeting with Jeff Shankman on Tuesday
January 16, 3:30 p.m.  at Jeff Shankman's office.

We are meeting to plan the agenda for the Tiger Team, a group of about 20 
Wharton School
students visiting excelr.  A Wharton  tiger team works through a semester on a 
special project, proposed by
a corporation. The team sponsored by excelr works on project regarding the 
impact of
electronic trading on the energy markets. The semester long project will  
result in a report that
will be submitted to excelr for review and evaluation. I hope that  you will 
find this report useful.

 We have invited our tiger team to visit excelr. The students will arrive on 
Thursday, 
January 18, and will spend Friday at excelr. I would appreciate if you could 
find 30 minutes
on Friday to talk to the students.

The meeting with Jeff on Tuesday  should not last longer than 10-15 minutes.

cash/futures getting whacked.  whereas last weekend cash traded $1 over G, 
this weekend will probably trade $.15 over.  the lack of weather giving the 
market time to regroup.  good thing because another week of cold and the 
system was going to break.   certainly still has that chance in feb.  saw 
utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting 
any extra demand through spot market.  in effect, they said we're not 
withdrawing anymore so we'll buy marketers storage.  they had to encourage 
marketers to sell it to them, so cash was extremely strong in periods of even 
normal demand and should continue to be if/when any weather comes again.  
this week demand so low that utilities can meet demand without buying much in 
mkt.  g/h getting whacked in sympathy.  
probably priced 25 term deals through broker market  and own originators in 
past two days.  24 were from the buy side.  it's as if pira came in and told 
everyone term was cheap.  however, they've got the opposite view.  customers 
just seeing gas at $4 anytime as being okay now.  don't see any let up in 
back support for a while.  
front spreads the hardest call right now.  g/h h/j j/k ??? can't decide what 
to do with them and from the volatility in them, appears neither can anybody 
else.  almost think best play is taking feb gas daily against march, hoping 
for a cold spell that breaks the system and get a couple $20+ prints in 
cash.  probably as likely to happen in g as h and g/h has much less 
downside.  

doing well here.  actually having the best month ever 11 days in.  played 
front short against term length.  got out of front shorts today.   probably 
early but gas has a history of getting off the canvas when least expected.  
will keep term length meanwhile.   i've hated summer backwardation forever.  
agree about u/h.  a little less crazy about  the trade now because i think 
the easy money was made over the past two days.  unbelievable spec demand for 
next winter over past week kept summer winter spread constant on rally up and 
crushed on move down.  jv/xh went from 22 to 3.5 in 5 days while front 
virtually unchanged.

don't know what to think of this summer longer term.  certainly not as easy 
as it was last summer when it was obvious $3 was not equilibrium for gas.  
now $6 for this summer, i don't know.  we're gonna have to inject the hell 
out of gas and keep some demand priced out for a long time.  but we will feel 
production increase hit the market.  just buy vol.

Brian,

I apologize if I didn't make myself clear over the phone.  There is a process 
that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with 
existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it 
is for a small subset of the population.  Furthermore, all applications must 
be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the 
desktops.  As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to 
install the application itself.

Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting?  It is installed 
with IE5 and provides real time chat.

I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at 
this time.

margins, I am sure it will help your P/L.

Citibank is one of your lead commercial banks while SSB is one of your lead

Well, never got to NY to enjoy New Years and the blizzard.? However, by 
staying in Dallas, did experience a white New Year's eve.? Never made it to 
Addison Cafe for New Year's eve dinner (back up plans), roads were just too 
bad.? But I cooked fresh salmon at home and we had a very lovely dinner. 

Hope you had a wonderful celebration (not quite the same as last year in 
Sidney, now was it) and brought in the new year with a bang!

Have a happy, healthy and much more prosperous 2001!? I wish only the best 
for you.? Love you much, your Mom

Is there a man by the name of Henry (Dutch) Quigley who will be working in 
your group?  His name was not on the list I sent to you previously,
but he showed up on another list from HR as being assigned to your group.  
Please let me know and I will make any necessary adjustments

Subject: Site Location Advisory Service




I am pleased to inform you that one of Canada's leading business service
providers, Grant Thornton LLP, is now offering US firms a full Site Location
Advisory Service.

With over forty offices across Canada, Grant Thornton LLP knows Canada.  We
are finding that more and more US corporations are looking north as they are
faced with fewer satisfactory location alternatives in which to expand.
Canada, with its relatively large and well trained work force, not to
mention lower operating costs, is increasingly being considered by companies
such as yours.

Grant Thornton LLP would be pleased to discuss this service with you.  It is
a full service that includes, on your behalf, real estate sourcing, labor
force analysis and verification, tax analysis and comparison, and incentive
negotiations.

Should you be considering expanding your operations and interested in
discussing our service, please give us a call.  More and more United States
firms, from call centers to manufacturers are locating in Canada to serve
both their US and Canadian customers.

Based in Moncton, New Brunswick Canada, I can be reached at:

I belong to a natgas discussion group on the internet. This is from one of 
the guys. Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot 
of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I 
found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no 
minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the 
lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in.

Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on 
what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And 
when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the 
information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the 
big ENE , i find it amusing that one of the most reserved and modest 
individuals I know is so talked about on the internet.

Subject: fund views

Hi- all the funds are trying to figure out what the play is for next year- 
major divergence of opinions.  Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view.

+ Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the 
perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no 
industrial (basic industry type) can operate.  He tracks all the plant 
closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a 
more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track 
this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic 
conditions- like recession!!).  I will try to find out what his total number 
for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does 
not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for 
the summer.

While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levels
He firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) 
based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally 
think that 1Q02 sees little.  I know that the fundamentals group is tracking 
these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q 
over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.

He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, 
crude/propane....

+ Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 
storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the 
backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower 
baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue.  I am torn 
on this one.

+ Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same 
analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long 
nat gas!! through vol or outright.

+ Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas 
just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM 
issues- they like to look out in the calendar years. 

+ The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: 
Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance 
(program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, 
I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.

Have a great holiday!  I'll be here next week.

 Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I

Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he 
should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. 
Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a 
large role in turning the crude and products group around. 

 Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of 
good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the 
gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products 
(especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods. I

Andy, Here is what I am aware of regarding availability of EOL for Sunday 
Trading.

The first Sunday that we opened for trading (I believe it was 10/1), we 
experienced a shutdown of the entire site late Saturday which, unfortunately 
included our monitors, which is why we were not aware of it until just prior 
to trading time.  Trading was to open at 2:00pm and we had the site up by 
aprox 2:15pm.

I am not aware of any issues on 10/8 and 10/15.

This past Sunday, 10/22 we had a problem with a release that we pushed out on 
Saturday.  We are working on our release procedures and will make every 
effort to have smoother releases in the future.

I hope this answers your questions, if not feel free to give me a call.

Subject: Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy



Subject:  Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy



Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at its
giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from the
Bonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a better
deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.
It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.
""The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know
what they're going to use to grow crops with,"" said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.
That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year. ""Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown,"" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the
company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in
December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,
which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its
existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative
officer.
""We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' "" he said.
Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but
Rosenbury said it would be ""substantial.""  In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate
the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. ""If this persists,""
Rosenbury said, ""it's going to be a real problem.""
He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now. ""Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that
farmers will not have as much as they want,"" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production. ""We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble
[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to
buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,"" said Paul
M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said. ""It's sticker shock.""
According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas
remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --
farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the
aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the
industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an
analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.
Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said. ""We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think,"" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies. ""But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast,"" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually
entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,
says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.
But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future
profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,
to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to
Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. ""Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an
ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live
up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,"" Mosey
said.

Per my voicemail, I've included a list of the Investors' questions and 
preliminary answers.  The answers are attempts by our group, Bob Crane and 
Bryon Hoskins but need confirmation by you.  Would you mind giving us some 
feedback for #4 as well?  I could not find these numbers.  These are again 
going to be forwarded to Bain Capital, the potential equity investor in the 
pulp, paper and steel net works fund.  They are in their final stages of due 
diligence and are comparing pulp and paper facts with gas.  (They are under a 
confidentiality agreement).  
Please call with any questions
Thank you,

1. # of years of NYMEX visibility on the typical gas curve.

3 years

2. # of daily trades on NYMEX, in total and for excelr specifically.

102,492 daily trades on NYMEX (11/28/00)and ours amounts to 8,061 per day 
(usually around 10% daily NYMEX trades)

3. length and nature of ""price discovery"" windows past the NYMEX portion of
the gas curve (e.g., 7 years of visibility provided by proprietary market
making past NYMEX, then 10 years of macro / industry average assumptions).

NYMEX price discovery equates to about 3 years. Liquidity of the market and 
proprietary market information equates to about 2 years after that with the 
remaining portion coming from more macro industry information.

4. trade volume data (# of daily trades as well) for each 5 year increment of
the gas curve beyond the NYMEX portion, in total and for excelr specifically.

Subject:  Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy



Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at its
giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from the
Bonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a better
deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.
It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.
""The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know
what they're going to use to grow crops with,"" said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.
That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year. ""Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown,"" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the
company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in
December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,
which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its
existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative
officer.
""We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' "" he said.
Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but
Rosenbury said it would be ""substantial.""  In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate
the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. ""If this persists,""
Rosenbury said, ""it's going to be a real problem.""
He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now. ""Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that
farmers will not have as much as they want,"" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production. ""We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble
[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to
buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,"" said Paul
M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said. ""It's sticker shock.""
According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas
remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --
farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the
aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the
industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an
analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.
Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said. ""We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think,"" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies. ""But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast,"" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually
entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,
says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.
But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future
profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,
to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to
Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. ""Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an
ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live
up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,"" Mosey
said.

PIRA report attached - bit uninspired this week, like the stats.

Crude went back to the usual pattern and built 2 .4 mbbls, as opposed to an 
implied draw (excl SPR) of 2 (although half of this in PADD 5). Perhaps 
surprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and 
gasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result. 
Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 
kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The cold 
weather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well 
above last year's Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphur 
material, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks. 
However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3.
Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not 
the finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production? 
Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. 
Imports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd.
Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incredibly 
high number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching.

John,
As we discussed earlier, ENA HR is working with the A/A program to develop a 
process for placing sr. spec into associate titles.  Unfortunately, that 
process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate.  
Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to 
interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA.  

Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in 
similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to 
be held the first week of Jan.  I would like to handle all of these 
consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this 
discussion.  I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until 
after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process.

Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received the 
title change.  Please clarify the situation with him at your earliest 
convenience.  If you need my assistance with this please let me know.   I 
apologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions.  Please 
contact me with any questions/concerns.

I tried to open EOL at 4 on Sunday, but we had systems problems that delayed 
the opening until 6:05.  This is the third time in four or five sessions when 
EOL had problems on Sunday.  Anything you can do to improve reliability would 
be appreciated.

7238,arnold-j/_sent_mail/9.,<12319276.1075857594379.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"a couple more thoughts.  certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to 
switching and slowdown in economy.  Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing 
plants for instance.  switching is significant and has led to cash in the 
gulf expiring weak everyday.  gas daily spread to prompt trading at 
$1....need some very cold weather to justify that.  this seems to be the test 
of the next 3-5 days.   Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management 
keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too 
many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub.  unless we get some crazy 
prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.  

funny watching the flies in the front.  Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50 
friday morning.  probably worth 1.30 now.  crazy.  people have seen each 
front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h.  

what's the thoughts on distillates...  is it tight enough such that gas 
switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market 
too oversupplied to care?",Non Abusive

Hope your interview goes well.  Things are going crazy in the gas market so, 
unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.  

As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.  
Be confident.  Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don't 
know but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find excelr 
appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.  

The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the 
trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask 
any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would 
probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the 
training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement 
though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure 
trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of 
other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall 
under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the 
head of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.

Write me about how your interviews went.
Good luck:
John

Hi John,

How are you today?  You must be pleased with excelr's most recent numbers.
Could you tell me a little more about the trading training program?  You
mentioned you wanted to expand it to two years, but what does the extra year
entail?  I have been selected for an interview next Monday, and I look
forward to seeing you again.  Do you have any tips on approaching the
interview process?  I have poured over the company website, and if you have
any tips I would love to hear them.

Thanks for your time, and I hope to see you Monday.

Cordially,

Adam Bayer
