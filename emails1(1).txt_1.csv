Subject: FW: Shut In Now and Generate Cash Flow


 
Morning.. this was produced by our marking desk in Houston who deals with small to midsize independent E&Ps who are small and predominately unhedged
 
The idea originated from statements by Mark Pappa at EOG.. that EOG could possibly shut in some production at certain price levels.  It is a response to their intent NOT a suggestion.
 
This is not excelr's TRADING view.. we do not think there will be shut-ins the near term because:
 
The producers are looking to shut in at $1.75 levels.. this would have to occur for several months.. cash is currently at this level but contangos are at all time highs..Nov01 is 42 cents above this level, Dec01 is 83 cents above this level. CY02..$1.05 and CY03 $1.525!!!
 
so.. no one is shutting in now.  as soon as we hear of anyone doing so, we will let you know..
 
So from a trading perspective we still advocate being short Nov, Dec, and 1st 6 months of CY02..
 
Please call me with questions.. I am in Houston this week (713-853-4759) and can set up discussions with John Arnold, Julie Gomez (our fundy specialist) or Jim Schweiger our Texas storage operator.
 
Coming... Rockies/ Canadian shut in thoughts..

A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly
speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous
on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water
glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning
of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He
proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he
found the following note on the door:

1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not
referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.
8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he
said,""Take this and eat it for it is my body.""  He did not
say, Eat me""
12.  The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,""
13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub
thanks for the grub, yeah God.
14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at
St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.


The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings
good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the
chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.
Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You
will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain
is not broken.

that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's 
tax cuts going to the ""wealthiest one percent"".   That is the biggest load of 
garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the 
math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to 
the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut, 
obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.

10. I have plenty of talent and vision.  I just don't give a damn.

11. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.

12. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely

13. I'm not being rude.  You're just insignificant.

14. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.

15. You sound reasonable.  Time to up the medication.

16. And your crybaby whiny-butt opinion would be...?

17. Do I look like a people person?

18. This isn't an office.  It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.

19. I started out with nothing & still have most of it left.

20. You!... Off my planet!

21. Does your train of thought have a caboose?

22. Errors have been made.  Others will be blamed.

23. Not all men are annoying. Some are dead.

24. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.

25. Can I trade this job for what's behind door 1?

26. Too many freaks, not enough circuses.

27. How do I set a laser printer to stun?

28. If I throw a stick, will you leave?

Eric,

Could you find some time to look at the new Southern Union contract for 
Galveston and Port Arthur?  Pricings are wrong in Sitara so my system 
invoices are being understated/overstated each month.

If you want, we could sit down and go over it to see what needs to be done.  

Let me know.

Thanks.

3. How about never? Is never good for you?

5. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.

6. I don't work here. I'm a consultant.

7. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit.

8. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid.

9. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.

10. I have plenty of talent and vision.  I just don't give a damn.

11. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.

12. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely
coincidental.

13. I'm not being rude.  You're just insignificant.

14. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.

15. You sound reasonable.  Time to up the medication.

16. And your crybaby whiny-butt opinion would be...?

17. Do I look like a people person?

18. This isn't an office.  It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.

19. I started out with nothing & still have most of it left.

20. You!... Off my planet!

21. Does your train of thought have a caboose?

22. Errors have been made.  Others will be blamed.

23. Not all men are annoying. Some are dead.

24. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.

25. Can I trade this job for what's behind door 1?

26. Too many freaks, not enough circuses.

27. How do I set a laser printer to stun?

28. If I throw a stick, will you leave?

Dear Santa,
You must be surprised I am writing you today, the 26th of
December. Well I would very much like to clear up certain things that have
occurred since the beginning of the month! While filled with illusions, I
wrote you a letter.  I asked for a bicycle, an electric train set, a pair of
roller blades, and a football uniform.  I destroyed my brain studying the
whole year!  Not only was I
first in my class, but I had the best grades in the whole school. I'm not
going to lie to you Santa; there was no one in the entire neighborhood that
behaved better than me. With my parents, my brothers, friends and my
neighbors, I would go on errands and even help the elderly across the
street.  There was virtually nothing I wouldn't do for humanity! WHAT BALLS
YOU HAVE LEAVING ME A FUCKING YO-YO, A STUPID ASS WHISTLE,AND A PAIR OF
SOCKS!!!What the FUCK were you THINKING, YOU FAT SON OF A BITCH!?!?!That
you've taken me for a SUCKER THE WHOLE FUCKING YEAR, to come out with some
SHIT LIKE THIS under the damn tree.  AS IF YOU HADN'T FUCKED ME ENOUGH,YOU
GAVE THAT LITTLE SHITHEAD ACROSS THE STREET SO MANY FUCKING TOYS, HECAN'T
EVEN WALK INTO HIS DAMN HOUSE! Please don't let me see you trying to fit
your BIG ASS DOWN MY CHIMNEY NEXT YEAR! I'LL FUCK YOU UP! I'll throw rocks
at those STUPID ASS REINDEERS OF YOURS, AND SCARE THEM THE FUCK AWAY, SO
YOU'LL HAVE TO WALK YOUR BIG FAT ASS EVERYWHERE, JUST LIKE I HAVE TO DO
SINCE YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT FUCKING BIKE, YOU PUNK BITCH. You know what
Santa, FUCK YOU!!  Next year you'll find out HOW BAD I CAN REALLY FUCKING
BE...YOU'VE BEEN STEPPING ON THIS MOTHERFUCKER FAR TOO LONG!
SO WATCH YOUR BACK NEXT YEAR, YOU FAT BITCH!

Sincerely,
Johnny

114,bass-e/all_documents/619.,<4773951.1075854592515.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Hey Guys,  I just typed a small novel (below) about JRTC and thought I send
it out, it's answerin a question a friend asked about how the simulated
comabt stuff works and has an example at the end.




Excellent question (about what makes the bad guys run away during an
exercise).


The Army paid Grumman a shitload of cash to make ""laser tag"" stuff for us.

It's called MILES and if you ever see a picture of an army unit on an
exercise you will see that the soldier is wearing a harness over his normal
Load Bearing Vest(LBV), the harness has four receptors on the front and four
on the back, in addition there is a doughnut shaped belt of receptors that
goes on the kevlar helmet.  Vehicles also have receptors mounted to them,
every thing from HMMV's to the tanks to the helicopters.

Our weapons systems have transmitters on them, it'll look like a little box
mounted on the front of the weapon, the box has a pressure sensor so every
time the gas from a blank round firing hits it it fires a laser beam down
range.  If the laser beam strikes a receptor the guys harness will emit this
God awful high pitched whine that lets everyone know he is down/dead.
AT-4's and Dragons (bazooka like anti-armor weapons) are simulated by what
are called Vipers, same weight, same size, except it fires a big powerful
laser that will be strong enough to activate an enemy tanks MILES.  The
armor vehicles MILES game is pretty neat.  There are two types of kills on a
tank, a Mobility kill, and a critical kill.  If the Viper or other weapon
doesn't have a solid hit on a sensor in a critical area, a mobility kill
will result which means the explosion just blew the trak of the vehicle but
its' radios and weapons still work.  A critical kill means, the vehicle and
all inside are dead dead dead.  If a tank gets a critical kill the MILES
gear will actually shut the vehicle down and kill its radios.  The guy will
just be drivin along and then he will hear over his radio a females voice
say, ""Critical kill"" and the only thing that will work on the vehicle after
that are the brakes.

So, direct fire weapons systems are pretty easy to replicate, target wears a
receptor, shooter fires a transmitter.

Indirect fire weapons though are a bit more difficult,  whereas before the
shooter always had eyes on the target and thus could directly place a laser
beam on target, artillery often shoots targets that no one directly see.

There are two ways around this.   At the National Training Center (NTC)
where they do all the armor against armor training, they have the MILES 2000
system.  You have an armored motorized rifle company(MRC) sitting at point
X,  I have an observer 15Km away who, with optics can see your
MRC, my FO calls in a fire mission, based on the target description a Bn 3
will be fired (54 rounds fired in 3 volleys as there are only 18 tubes in a
Bn.  The Observer-Controllers (OCs), kinna like referees, will monitor the
Call for Fire from the observer to the tubes, and the OCs will take the fire
mission data and plug it into their big MILES computer which will take into
account any errors the observer may have made and any errors the gun
batteries (instead of Artillery Companies we have artillery Batteries (6
guns)) may have made.  When the gun batteries tell the observer that they
have pulled the trigger, the OCs, who are always listening, will pull the
Miles trigger.  What happens then is a satellite hovering above NTC will
blast down a laser with a footprint large enough to simulate the area 18
artillery rounds would take up, it will do this 3 times to simulate all 3
volleys landing.  Any vehicles caught in this footprint will be assessed as
damaged/destroyed.

At JRTC where the Light Fighters (i.e. no armor assets organic to them)
learn to play,  we don't get no stinkin satellites.  What we do there is,
when a fire mission is called to the guns, the OCs will monitor it and enter
the data in their computers, the computer will take into account any errors
made by the FO and the guns and will spit out a grid coordinate,  this grid
will be passed to a ""Fire Marker"" which is a crazy guy with a four wheeler,
a GPS, and a god gun (a hand held transmitter that fires a universal kill
laser i.e. men to tanks and aircraft).  I say crazy because these guys are
civilians who get bonuses based on how fast they can get to the target grid.
  Their average response time is 4 1/2 minutes, which is about 3 minutes
longer then it would be in real life so it's not as cool as MILES 2000.  So
you'll see these guys haulin ass through the woods on theses 4 wheelers
tryin to get to their target grids on time, and God help you if he pulls up
into your position and no you can't haul ass if you see one comin your way
cause your OC who is walkin with your unit will zap you on the spot if he
sees you runnin from a fire marker.  I'll close this bad boy with a little
story.

""Oh shit, there I was"" (all good 'war' stories gotta start with this).
We had started the first phase of the rotation, ""Entry into the Box"" (the
box is the JRTC engagement area) at 2300hrs the previous night and had
fought our way 7 Km SW hand railing a road, identifying mine/wire obstacles
and eliminating the Observers over watching them.  It was 0800 the next
morning and we were dead f-kin tired and had finally reached our main
objective which was a road inter-section in a semi wooded area just to the
south of the main air field that the rest of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT)
was gonna use to lift in the rest of the support assets.  There was a BIG
triangular berm area just off the road, basically the dirt walls were 10 ft
tall 50 yard long.  We moved out of the tree line and occupied it cause at
the time it looked like it would be super easy to defend, which was good
cause we needed to hole up for a bit and catch out breath, plus our COLT
team (Combat Observer Laser Team = mounted (on a HMMVV) FO's with Laser
designators to guide Copperheads and Hellfire missiles, basically vehicle
killers) and Bradley support vehicles had just 'discovered' (BOOM) a mine
field at the intersection, this was happening as we were occupying the berm.
  So we detached a small element to go evac the Casualties from the
vehicles, the 1SG and a couple of joes. 3 min later the 1SG and his team
were nailed by anti-personnel mines surrounding the mine field while trying
to aid the wounded inside the vehicles.  At the same time a ""Civilian"" truck
with two redneck lookin females showed up like they were fixin to drive
right on through the road so we had to send a few guys out of the berm to
stop/search the vehicle (at JRTC they employ real civilian actors to portray
Civilians on the Battlefield or COBs, because in real life there are COBs
and we gotta know how to deal with them and accomplish our mission at the
same time).  So we got the 1SG and a couple of guys down at the obstacle, a
COB truck right outside the berm when the CO decides to go check on the
obstacle.  By this time we had been in this BIG berm (read TRP (Target
Reference Point or somethin the enemy probably has his guns laid on just
waitin for some morons to park their sad tired asses in there long enough to
get a mission off)) for like 15 minutes when sure enough off in the distance
we hear this vrrrrrm getting steadily louder and louder.  We were so tired
we were basically denying the obvious, ""there's no way he's headed for us,
please God don't let him be headed for us"" basically you had an entire
company in a 100 yard radius which is about the same size as a 82mm mortar
impact area.  So there we are listening to this 4 wheeler get closer and
closer and basically all we can do is start to get all our gear back on and
get ready to HAUL ass.  Of course we can't legally run until the first round
impacts.  So this guys comes tearin down the road, shoots off the road and
pulls SMACK DAB into the middle of the berm, jumps off his bike and starts
UNLOADING with air burst Arty Simulators (basically a little flare gun that
pops 1/4 sticks of TNT up 40 ft into the air to simulate incoming rounds.
Note: these are only used when the grid is so accurate that using ground
burst simulators would pose a hazard to troops).  Basically what this told
us is that we were setup, the baddies were just waitin for us cause the
rounds were accurate on the first volley and needed no adjustment.  So yeah,
this joker is poppin off airburst TNT, after the first burst I yelled
INCOMING and got up and hauled ASS.  Luckily I was close to the exit and
started movin out FAST, because between airbursts the Fire Marker was just
sweeping left to right with the God gun as guys were scramblin tryin to get
out.  I got out of the Berm and just kept runnin a good 200M because I'm
Artillery and I know what the burst radius is on these suckers.  I looked
back and saw the Infantry guys stoppin at a tree just outside the berm.
Since there were no visible Real life ground bursts they thought they were
safe.  As I was yellin at them to keep movin an OC came out and just whacked
em all (16 guys).  As the rest of the people who made it out were still
runnin, about 25 of us and we were all now 150-200M North of the berm,
scattered all over hell.  Little bunches of 5-6 guys runnin to trees and
collapsing.  Just as the last of the living made it out of the berm, we hear
this vehicle come tearing outta the trees about 50M to our left and from
lower ground.  Sure enough it's a DsHKA (read Dishka, basically a 50 Cal on
a friggin truck bed),  so there this fucker is lighting us up from the left
and enemy 82mm Mortar fire blastin our tail ends.  Since the DsHKA was a
high payoff TGT I was immediately on my net sreamin ""Holy Shit we got a
DsHKA here, Grid 785436 HELLLLPPPP!!!""  At the same time we got Infantry
guys tryin to suppress the joker on the back of truck with their M4's while
trying to get two Vipers together (we were told by the OC's that the only
thing they've ever seen kill vehicle here with was two Vipers fired at the
same section of the vehicle at exactly the same time)  but the Viper teams
were scattered all over hell.  All this happened within about 30 seconds,
the CO had seen us come tearin outta the Berm and heard the DsHKA light up
so he was on his net talkin to the Kiowa's (scout helicopters but they're
armed).  So we're pinned down, trying to suppress this truck while dodgin 50
Cal laser blasts (since its just MILES a blade of grass can deflect the
laser).  FINALLY the Kiowas show up (actually they got there respectably
fast only 2-3 minutes) chase the bastard down and smash him with their
hellfires.  With 30 of 65 guys dead, and one DsHKA down, we were ready to
get a little rest and then start huntin the mortar and other 2 DsHKAs that
were supposed to be in the area.

Basically we got the shit ambushed outta us, it was really a pretty nice
setup on the enemies part.  We were stupid enough to setup in an obvious
terrain feature, one that was no doubt on the Enemy's target lists.  So when
the mortar rounds started droppin and we started pouring out of the berm
there the 50 cal was waitin to mow down whoever didn't get killed by the
Arty.

Anyways, that's one of my JRTC stories and subsequently one of the largest
e-mails I've ever written. So I'm gonna forward it to the rest of the guys.

Welp, its about time to go get my drink on, talk to y'all later.

A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly
speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous
on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water
glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning
of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He
proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he
found the following note on the door:

1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not
referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.
8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he
said,""Take this and eat it for it is my body.""  He did not
say, Eat me""
12.  The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,""
13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub
thanks for the grub, yeah God.
14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at
St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.


The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings
good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the
chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.
Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You
will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain
is not broken.

Subject:  Johnny Christmas Letter

Dear Santa,
You must be surprised I am writing you today, the 26th of
December. Well I would very much like to clear up certain things that have
occurred since the beginning of the month! While filled with illusions, I
wrote you a letter.  I asked for a bicycle, an electric train set, a pair of
roller blades, and a football uniform.  I destroyed my brain studying the
whole year!  Not only was I
first in my class, but I had the best grades in the whole school. I'm not
going to lie to you Santa; there was no one in the entire neighborhood that
behaved better than me. With my parents, my brothers, friends and my
neighbors, I would go on errands and even help the elderly across the
street.  There was virtually nothing I wouldn't do for humanity! WHAT BALLS
YOU HAVE LEAVING ME A FUCKING YO-YO, A STUPID ASS WHISTLE,AND A PAIR OF
SOCKS!!!What the FUCK were you THINKING, YOU FAT SON OF A BITCH!?!?!That
you've taken me for a SUCKER THE WHOLE FUCKING YEAR, to come out with some
SHIT LIKE THIS under the damn tree.  AS IF YOU HADN'T FUCKED ME ENOUGH,YOU
GAVE THAT LITTLE SHITHEAD ACROSS THE STREET SO MANY FUCKING TOYS, HECAN'T
EVEN WALK INTO HIS DAMN HOUSE! Please don't let me see you trying to fit
your BIG ASS DOWN MY CHIMNEY NEXT YEAR! I'LL FUCK YOU UP! I'll throw rocks
at those STUPID ASS REINDEERS OF YOURS, AND SCARE THEM THE FUCK AWAY, SO
YOU'LL HAVE TO WALK YOUR BIG FAT ASS EVERYWHERE, JUST LIKE I HAVE TO DO
SINCE YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT FUCKING BIKE, YOU PUNK BITCH. You know what
Santa, FUCK YOU!!  Next year you'll find out HOW BAD I CAN REALLY FUCKING
BE...YOU'VE BEEN STEPPING ON THIS MOTHERFUCKER FAR TOO LONG!
SO WATCH YOUR BACK NEXT YEAR, YOU FAT BITCH!

Sincerely,
Johnny

143,bass-e/discussion_threads/655.,<1643240.1075854639001.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Hey Guys,  I just typed a small novel (below) about JRTC and thought I send
it out, it's answerin a question a friend asked about how the simulated
comabt stuff works and has an example at the end.




Excellent question (about what makes the bad guys run away during an
exercise).


The Army paid Grumman a shitload of cash to make ""laser tag"" stuff for us.

It's called MILES and if you ever see a picture of an army unit on an
exercise you will see that the soldier is wearing a harness over his normal
Load Bearing Vest(LBV), the harness has four receptors on the front and four
on the back, in addition there is a doughnut shaped belt of receptors that
goes on the kevlar helmet.  Vehicles also have receptors mounted to them,
every thing from HMMV's to the tanks to the helicopters.

Our weapons systems have transmitters on them, it'll look like a little box
mounted on the front of the weapon, the box has a pressure sensor so every
time the gas from a blank round firing hits it it fires a laser beam down
range.  If the laser beam strikes a receptor the guys harness will emit this
God awful high pitched whine that lets everyone know he is down/dead.
AT-4's and Dragons (bazooka like anti-armor weapons) are simulated by what
are called Vipers, same weight, same size, except it fires a big powerful
laser that will be strong enough to activate an enemy tanks MILES.  The
armor vehicles MILES game is pretty neat.  There are two types of kills on a
tank, a Mobility kill, and a critical kill.  If the Viper or other weapon
doesn't have a solid hit on a sensor in a critical area, a mobility kill
will result which means the explosion just blew the trak of the vehicle but
its' radios and weapons still work.  A critical kill means, the vehicle and
all inside are dead dead dead.  If a tank gets a critical kill the MILES
gear will actually shut the vehicle down and kill its radios.  The guy will
just be drivin along and then he will hear over his radio a females voice
say, ""Critical kill"" and the only thing that will work on the vehicle after
that are the brakes.

So, direct fire weapons systems are pretty easy to replicate, target wears a
receptor, shooter fires a transmitter.

Indirect fire weapons though are a bit more difficult,  whereas before the
shooter always had eyes on the target and thus could directly place a laser
beam on target, artillery often shoots targets that no one directly see.

There are two ways around this.   At the National Training Center (NTC)
where they do all the armor against armor training, they have the MILES 2000
system.  You have an armored motorized rifle company(MRC) sitting at point
X,  I have an observer 15Km away who, with optics can see your
MRC, my FO calls in a fire mission, based on the target description a Bn 3
will be fired (54 rounds fired in 3 volleys as there are only 18 tubes in a
Bn.  The Observer-Controllers (OCs), kinna like referees, will monitor the
Call for Fire from the observer to the tubes, and the OCs will take the fire
mission data and plug it into their big MILES computer which will take into
account any errors the observer may have made and any errors the gun
batteries (instead of Artillery Companies we have artillery Batteries (6
guns)) may have made.  When the gun batteries tell the observer that they
have pulled the trigger, the OCs, who are always listening, will pull the
Miles trigger.  What happens then is a satellite hovering above NTC will
blast down a laser with a footprint large enough to simulate the area 18
artillery rounds would take up, it will do this 3 times to simulate all 3
volleys landing.  Any vehicles caught in this footprint will be assessed as
damaged/destroyed.

At JRTC where the Light Fighters (i.e. no armor assets organic to them)
learn to play,  we don't get no stinkin satellites.  What we do there is,
when a fire mission is called to the guns, the OCs will monitor it and enter
the data in their computers, the computer will take into account any errors
made by the FO and the guns and will spit out a grid coordinate,  this grid
will be passed to a ""Fire Marker"" which is a crazy guy with a four wheeler,
a GPS, and a god gun (a hand held transmitter that fires a universal kill
laser i.e. men to tanks and aircraft).  I say crazy because these guys are
civilians who get bonuses based on how fast they can get to the target grid.
  Their average response time is 4 1/2 minutes, which is about 3 minutes
longer then it would be in real life so it's not as cool as MILES 2000.  So
you'll see these guys haulin ass through the woods on theses 4 wheelers
tryin to get to their target grids on time, and God help you if he pulls up
into your position and no you can't haul ass if you see one comin your way
cause your OC who is walkin with your unit will zap you on the spot if he
sees you runnin from a fire marker.  I'll close this bad boy with a little
story.

""Oh shit, there I was"" (all good 'war' stories gotta start with this).
We had started the first phase of the rotation, ""Entry into the Box"" (the
box is the JRTC engagement area) at 2300hrs the previous night and had
fought our way 7 Km SW hand railing a road, identifying mine/wire obstacles
and eliminating the Observers over watching them.  It was 0800 the next
morning and we were dead f-kin tired and had finally reached our main
objective which was a road inter-section in a semi wooded area just to the
south of the main air field that the rest of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT)
was gonna use to lift in the rest of the support assets.  There was a BIG
triangular berm area just off the road, basically the dirt walls were 10 ft
tall 50 yard long.  We moved out of the tree line and occupied it cause at
the time it looked like it would be super easy to defend, which was good
cause we needed to hole up for a bit and catch out breath, plus our COLT
team (Combat Observer Laser Team = mounted (on a HMMVV) FO's with Laser
designators to guide Copperheads and Hellfire missiles, basically vehicle
killers) and Bradley support vehicles had just 'discovered' (BOOM) a mine
field at the intersection, this was happening as we were occupying the berm.
  So we detached a small element to go evac the Casualties from the
vehicles, the 1SG and a couple of joes. 3 min later the 1SG and his team
were nailed by anti-personnel mines surrounding the mine field while trying
to aid the wounded inside the vehicles.  At the same time a ""Civilian"" truck
with two redneck lookin females showed up like they were fixin to drive
right on through the road so we had to send a few guys out of the berm to
stop/search the vehicle (at JRTC they employ real civilian actors to portray
Civilians on the Battlefield or COBs, because in real life there are COBs
and we gotta know how to deal with them and accomplish our mission at the
same time).  So we got the 1SG and a couple of guys down at the obstacle, a
COB truck right outside the berm when the CO decides to go check on the
obstacle.  By this time we had been in this BIG berm (read TRP (Target
Reference Point or somethin the enemy probably has his guns laid on just
waitin for some morons to park their sad tired asses in there long enough to
get a mission off)) for like 15 minutes when sure enough off in the distance
we hear this vrrrrrm getting steadily louder and louder.  We were so tired
we were basically denying the obvious, ""there's no way he's headed for us,
please God don't let him be headed for us"" basically you had an entire
company in a 100 yard radius which is about the same size as a 82mm mortar
impact area.  So there we are listening to this 4 wheeler get closer and
closer and basically all we can do is start to get all our gear back on and
get ready to HAUL ass.  Of course we can't legally run until the first round
impacts.  So this guys comes tearin down the road, shoots off the road and
pulls SMACK DAB into the middle of the berm, jumps off his bike and starts
UNLOADING with air burst Arty Simulators (basically a little flare gun that
pops 1/4 sticks of TNT up 40 ft into the air to simulate incoming rounds.
Note: these are only used when the grid is so accurate that using ground
burst simulators would pose a hazard to troops).  Basically what this told
us is that we were setup, the baddies were just waitin for us cause the
rounds were accurate on the first volley and needed no adjustment.  So yeah,
this joker is poppin off airburst TNT, after the first burst I yelled
INCOMING and got up and hauled ASS.  Luckily I was close to the exit and
started movin out FAST, because between airbursts the Fire Marker was just
sweeping left to right with the God gun as guys were scramblin tryin to get
out.  I got out of the Berm and just kept runnin a good 200M because I'm
Artillery and I know what the burst radius is on these suckers.  I looked
back and saw the Infantry guys stoppin at a tree just outside the berm.
Since there were no visible Real life ground bursts they thought they were
safe.  As I was yellin at them to keep movin an OC came out and just whacked
em all (16 guys).  As the rest of the people who made it out were still
runnin, about 25 of us and we were all now 150-200M North of the berm,
scattered all over hell.  Little bunches of 5-6 guys runnin to trees and
collapsing.  Just as the last of the living made it out of the berm, we hear
this vehicle come tearing outta the trees about 50M to our left and from
lower ground.  Sure enough it's a DsHKA (read Dishka, basically a 50 Cal on
a friggin truck bed),  so there this fucker is lighting us up from the left
and enemy 82mm Mortar fire blastin our tail ends.  Since the DsHKA was a
high payoff TGT I was immediately on my net sreamin ""Holy Shit we got a
DsHKA here, Grid 785436 HELLLLPPPP!!!""  At the same time we got Infantry
guys tryin to suppress the joker on the back of truck with their M4's while
trying to get two Vipers together (we were told by the OC's that the only
thing they've ever seen kill vehicle here with was two Vipers fired at the
same section of the vehicle at exactly the same time)  but the Viper teams
were scattered all over hell.  All this happened within about 30 seconds,
the CO had seen us come tearin outta the Berm and heard the DsHKA light up
so he was on his net talkin to the Kiowa's (scout helicopters but they're
armed).  So we're pinned down, trying to suppress this truck while dodgin 50
Cal laser blasts (since its just MILES a blade of grass can deflect the
laser).  FINALLY the Kiowas show up (actually they got there respectably
fast only 2-3 minutes) chase the bastard down and smash him with their
hellfires.  With 30 of 65 guys dead, and one DsHKA down, we were ready to
get a little rest and then start huntin the mortar and other 2 DsHKAs that
were supposed to be in the area.

Basically we got the shit ambushed outta us, it was really a pretty nice
setup on the enemies part.  We were stupid enough to setup in an obvious
terrain feature, one that was no doubt on the Enemy's target lists.  So when
the mortar rounds started droppin and we started pouring out of the berm
there the 50 cal was waitin to mow down whoever didn't get killed by the
Arty.

Anyways, that's one of my JRTC stories and subsequently one of the largest
e-mails I've ever written. So I'm gonna forward it to the rest of the guys.

Welp, its about time to go get my drink on, talk to y'all later.

LAWLER,OUT.

Eric,

Could you find some time to look at the new Southern Union contract for 
Galveston and Port Arthur?  Pricings are wrong in Sitara so my system 
invoices are being understated/overstated each month.

If you want, we could sit down and go over it to see what needs to be done.  

Let me know.

Thanks.

A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.

bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.",Abusive

        Story With A Moral 

        A boy rode on a donkey and the old man walked.  As they went along they passed some people who remarked it was a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, so they changed positions. 

        Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a shame, he makes that little boy walk.""They then decided they both would walk! 

        Soon they passed some more people who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a decent donkey to ride. So,they both rode the donkey. 


        Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy and man said they were probably right, so they decided to carry the donkey. 

        As they crossed the bridge, they lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river and drowned. 

        The moral of the story? 

        If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss your ass good-bye.

If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the

my tongue in it. I am thirsty.

the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black

I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When

I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.",Abusive

Subject:  Johnny Christmas Letter

Dear Santa,
You must be surprised I am writing you today, the 26th of
December. Well I would very much like to clear up certain things that have
occurred since the beginning of the month! While filled with illusions, I
wrote you a letter.  I asked for a bicycle, an electric train set, a pair of
roller blades, and a football uniform.  I destroyed my brain studying the
whole year!  Not only was I
first in my class, but I had the best grades in the whole school. I'm not
going to lie to you Santa; there was no one in the entire neighborhood that
behaved better than me. With my parents, my brothers, friends and my
neighbors, I would go on errands and even help the elderly across the
street.  There was virtually nothing I wouldn't do for humanity! WHAT BALLS
YOU HAVE LEAVING ME A FUCKING YO-YO, A STUPID ASS WHISTLE,AND A PAIR OF
SOCKS!!!What the FUCK were you THINKING, YOU FAT SON OF A BITCH!?!?!That
you've taken me for a SUCKER THE WHOLE FUCKING YEAR, to come out with some
SHIT LIKE THIS under the damn tree.  AS IF YOU HADN'T FUCKED ME ENOUGH,YOU
GAVE THAT LITTLE SHITHEAD ACROSS THE STREET SO MANY FUCKING TOYS, HECAN'T
EVEN WALK INTO HIS DAMN HOUSE! Please don't let me see you trying to fit
your BIG ASS DOWN MY CHIMNEY NEXT YEAR! I'LL FUCK YOU UP! I'll throw rocks
at those STUPID ASS REINDEERS OF YOURS, AND SCARE THEM THE FUCK AWAY, SO
YOU'LL HAVE TO WALK YOUR BIG FAT ASS EVERYWHERE, JUST LIKE I HAVE TO DO
SINCE YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT FUCKING BIKE, YOU PUNK BITCH. You know what
Santa, FUCK YOU!!  Next year you'll find out HOW BAD I CAN REALLY FUCKING
BE...YOU'VE BEEN STEPPING ON THIS MOTHERFUCKER FAR TOO LONG!
SO WATCH YOUR BACK NEXT YEAR, YOU FAT BITCH!

Sincerely,
Johnny

158,bass-e/notes_inbox/519.,<12578352.1075854679564.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Hey Guys,  I just typed a small novel (below) about JRTC and thought I send
it out, it's answerin a question a friend asked about how the simulated
comabt stuff works and has an example at the end.




Excellent question (about what makes the bad guys run away during an
exercise).


The Army paid Grumman a shitload of cash to make ""laser tag"" stuff for us.

It's called MILES and if you ever see a picture of an army unit on an
exercise you will see that the soldier is wearing a harness over his normal
Load Bearing Vest(LBV), the harness has four receptors on the front and four
on the back, in addition there is a doughnut shaped belt of receptors that
goes on the kevlar helmet.  Vehicles also have receptors mounted to them,
every thing from HMMV's to the tanks to the helicopters.

Our weapons systems have transmitters on them, it'll look like a little box
mounted on the front of the weapon, the box has a pressure sensor so every
time the gas from a blank round firing hits it it fires a laser beam down
range.  If the laser beam strikes a receptor the guys harness will emit this
God awful high pitched whine that lets everyone know he is down/dead.
AT-4's and Dragons (bazooka like anti-armor weapons) are simulated by what
are called Vipers, same weight, same size, except it fires a big powerful
laser that will be strong enough to activate an enemy tanks MILES.  The
armor vehicles MILES game is pretty neat.  There are two types of kills on a
tank, a Mobility kill, and a critical kill.  If the Viper or other weapon
doesn't have a solid hit on a sensor in a critical area, a mobility kill
will result which means the explosion just blew the trak of the vehicle but
its' radios and weapons still work.  A critical kill means, the vehicle and
all inside are dead dead dead.  If a tank gets a critical kill the MILES
gear will actually shut the vehicle down and kill its radios.  The guy will
just be drivin along and then he will hear over his radio a females voice
say, ""Critical kill"" and the only thing that will work on the vehicle after
that are the brakes.

So, direct fire weapons systems are pretty easy to replicate, target wears a
receptor, shooter fires a transmitter.

Indirect fire weapons though are a bit more difficult,  whereas before the
shooter always had eyes on the target and thus could directly place a laser
beam on target, artillery often shoots targets that no one directly see.

There are two ways around this.   At the National Training Center (NTC)
where they do all the armor against armor training, they have the MILES 2000
system.  You have an armored motorized rifle company(MRC) sitting at point
X,  I have an observer 15Km away who, with optics can see your
MRC, my FO calls in a fire mission, based on the target description a Bn 3
will be fired (54 rounds fired in 3 volleys as there are only 18 tubes in a
Bn.  The Observer-Controllers (OCs), kinna like referees, will monitor the
Call for Fire from the observer to the tubes, and the OCs will take the fire
mission data and plug it into their big MILES computer which will take into
account any errors the observer may have made and any errors the gun
batteries (instead of Artillery Companies we have artillery Batteries (6
guns)) may have made.  When the gun batteries tell the observer that they
have pulled the trigger, the OCs, who are always listening, will pull the
Miles trigger.  What happens then is a satellite hovering above NTC will
blast down a laser with a footprint large enough to simulate the area 18
artillery rounds would take up, it will do this 3 times to simulate all 3
volleys landing.  Any vehicles caught in this footprint will be assessed as
damaged/destroyed.

At JRTC where the Light Fighters (i.e. no armor assets organic to them)
learn to play,  we don't get no stinkin satellites.  What we do there is,
when a fire mission is called to the guns, the OCs will monitor it and enter
the data in their computers, the computer will take into account any errors
made by the FO and the guns and will spit out a grid coordinate,  this grid
will be passed to a ""Fire Marker"" which is a crazy guy with a four wheeler,
a GPS, and a god gun (a hand held transmitter that fires a universal kill
laser i.e. men to tanks and aircraft).  I say crazy because these guys are
civilians who get bonuses based on how fast they can get to the target grid.
  Their average response time is 4 1/2 minutes, which is about 3 minutes
longer then it would be in real life so it's not as cool as MILES 2000.  So
you'll see these guys haulin ass through the woods on theses 4 wheelers
tryin to get to their target grids on time, and God help you if he pulls up
into your position and no you can't haul ass if you see one comin your way
cause your OC who is walkin with your unit will zap you on the spot if he
sees you runnin from a fire marker.  I'll close this bad boy with a little
story.

""Oh shit, there I was"" (all good 'war' stories gotta start with this).
We had started the first phase of the rotation, ""Entry into the Box"" (the
box is the JRTC engagement area) at 2300hrs the previous night and had
fought our way 7 Km SW hand railing a road, identifying mine/wire obstacles
and eliminating the Observers over watching them.  It was 0800 the next
morning and we were dead f-kin tired and had finally reached our main
objective which was a road inter-section in a semi wooded area just to the
south of the main air field that the rest of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT)
was gonna use to lift in the rest of the support assets.  There was a BIG
triangular berm area just off the road, basically the dirt walls were 10 ft
tall 50 yard long.  We moved out of the tree line and occupied it cause at
the time it looked like it would be super easy to defend, which was good
cause we needed to hole up for a bit and catch out breath, plus our COLT
team (Combat Observer Laser Team = mounted (on a HMMVV) FO's with Laser
designators to guide Copperheads and Hellfire missiles, basically vehicle
killers) and Bradley support vehicles had just 'discovered' (BOOM) a mine
field at the intersection, this was happening as we were occupying the berm.
  So we detached a small element to go evac the Casualties from the
vehicles, the 1SG and a couple of joes. 3 min later the 1SG and his team
were nailed by anti-personnel mines surrounding the mine field while trying
to aid the wounded inside the vehicles.  At the same time a ""Civilian"" truck
with two redneck lookin females showed up like they were fixin to drive
right on through the road so we had to send a few guys out of the berm to
stop/search the vehicle (at JRTC they employ real civilian actors to portray
Civilians on the Battlefield or COBs, because in real life there are COBs
and we gotta know how to deal with them and accomplish our mission at the
same time).  So we got the 1SG and a couple of guys down at the obstacle, a
COB truck right outside the berm when the CO decides to go check on the
obstacle.  By this time we had been in this BIG berm (read TRP (Target
Reference Point or somethin the enemy probably has his guns laid on just
waitin for some morons to park their sad tired asses in there long enough to
get a mission off)) for like 15 minutes when sure enough off in the distance
we hear this vrrrrrm getting steadily louder and louder.  We were so tired
we were basically denying the obvious, ""there's no way he's headed for us,
please God don't let him be headed for us"" basically you had an entire
company in a 100 yard radius which is about the same size as a 82mm mortar
impact area.  So there we are listening to this 4 wheeler get closer and
closer and basically all we can do is start to get all our gear back on and
get ready to HAUL ass.  Of course we can't legally run until the first round
impacts.  So this guys comes tearin down the road, shoots off the road and
pulls SMACK DAB into the middle of the berm, jumps off his bike and starts
UNLOADING with air burst Arty Simulators (basically a little flare gun that
pops 1/4 sticks of TNT up 40 ft into the air to simulate incoming rounds.
Note: these are only used when the grid is so accurate that using ground
burst simulators would pose a hazard to troops).  Basically what this told
us is that we were setup, the baddies were just waitin for us cause the
rounds were accurate on the first volley and needed no adjustment.  So yeah,
this joker is poppin off airburst TNT, after the first burst I yelled
INCOMING and got up and hauled ASS.  Luckily I was close to the exit and
started movin out FAST, because between airbursts the Fire Marker was just
sweeping left to right with the God gun as guys were scramblin tryin to get
out.  I got out of the Berm and just kept runnin a good 200M because I'm
Artillery and I know what the burst radius is on these suckers.  I looked
back and saw the Infantry guys stoppin at a tree just outside the berm.
Since there were no visible Real life ground bursts they thought they were
safe.  As I was yellin at them to keep movin an OC came out and just whacked
em all (16 guys).  As the rest of the people who made it out were still
runnin, about 25 of us and we were all now 150-200M North of the berm,
scattered all over hell.  Little bunches of 5-6 guys runnin to trees and
collapsing.  Just as the last of the living made it out of the berm, we hear
this vehicle come tearing outta the trees about 50M to our left and from
lower ground.  Sure enough it's a DsHKA (read Dishka, basically a 50 Cal on
a friggin truck bed),  so there this fucker is lighting us up from the left
and enemy 82mm Mortar fire blastin our tail ends.  Since the DsHKA was a
high payoff TGT I was immediately on my net sreamin ""Holy Shit we got a
DsHKA here, Grid 785436 HELLLLPPPP!!!""  At the same time we got Infantry
guys tryin to suppress the joker on the back of truck with their M4's while
trying to get two Vipers together (we were told by the OC's that the only
thing they've ever seen kill vehicle here with was two Vipers fired at the
same section of the vehicle at exactly the same time)  but the Viper teams
were scattered all over hell.  All this happened within about 30 seconds,
the CO had seen us come tearin outta the Berm and heard the DsHKA light up
so he was on his net talkin to the Kiowa's (scout helicopters but they're
armed).  So we're pinned down, trying to suppress this truck while dodgin 50
Cal laser blasts (since its just MILES a blade of grass can deflect the
laser).  FINALLY the Kiowas show up (actually they got there respectably
fast only 2-3 minutes) chase the bastard down and smash him with their
hellfires.  With 30 of 65 guys dead, and one DsHKA down, we were ready to
get a little rest and then start huntin the mortar and other 2 DsHKAs that
were supposed to be in the area.

Basically we got the shit ambushed outta us, it was really a pretty nice
setup on the enemies part.  We were stupid enough to setup in an obvious
terrain feature, one that was no doubt on the Enemy's target lists.  So when
the mortar rounds started droppin and we started pouring out of the berm
there the 50 cal was waitin to mow down whoever didn't get killed by the
Arty.

Anyways, that's one of my JRTC stories and subsequently one of the largest
e-mails I've ever written. So I'm gonna forward it to the rest of the guys.

Welp, its about time to go get my drink on, talk to y'all later.

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.",Abusive

A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time

10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.",Abusive

Texas stinks!  As I said before, Chris Simms is the best 5 yard passer in college football history.  When the game is on the line, he chokes!  After he turned the ball over 4 times, he had to fake like he sprained his pinky so that he could go and cry on the sideline.  Texas had to call on their savior from Baton Rouge, but it was a little too late for Major to erase the mistakes of Sissy Simms.

Well, we blew it last night. We should have won that game. Let's try and get 
together on the weekend of July 8th. Ask around and let's all try and find a 
gym so we don't have to play outside. Let me know what you hear and when you 
would like to get together.

Some phrases you wish you could say at work:

1. Ahhh...I see the fuck-up fairy has visited us again...

2. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce.

3. How about never? Is never good for you?

4. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself
in  public.

5. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.

6. I don't work here. I'm a consultant.

7. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit.

8. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid.

9. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.

10. I have plenty of talent and vision.  I just don't give a damn.

11. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.

12. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely
coincidental.

13. I'm not being rude.  You're just insignificant.

14. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.

15. You sound reasonable.  Time to up the medication.

16. And your crybaby whiny-butt opinion would be...?

17. Do I look like a people person?

18. This isn't an office.  It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.

19. I started out with nothing & still have most of it left.

20. You!... Off my planet!

21. Does your train of thought have a caboose?

22. Errors have been made.  Others will be blamed.

23. Not all men are annoying. Some are dead.

24. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.

25. Can I trade this job for what's behind door 1?

26. Too many freaks, not enough circuses.

27. How do I set a laser printer to stun?

28. If I throw a stick, will you leave?

Could you find some time to look at the new Southern Union contract for

If you want, we could sit down and go over it to see what needs to be done.

A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly
speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous
on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water
glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning
of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He
proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he
found the following note on the door:

1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not
referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.
8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he
said,""Take this and eat it for it is my body.""  He did not
say, Eat me""
12.  The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,""
13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub
thanks for the grub, yeah God.
14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at
St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.


The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings
good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the
chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.
Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You
will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain
is not broken.

hourly group I took it upon myself to make something as easy as OATI even 
easier.  It seems that every time I log on lately I get booted off.  I know I 
ain't doin nothin but it is still very frustratin so I did some thinkin and 
labeled all da desk with their own excelr Oati address.  If you look to your 
far left screen, notice how I made this simple for us, you will find an excelr 
label i.e. excelr 2.  This means your user id is excelr 2 and your password is 
8ball2. For those of you who don't know what I just typed or if I am not 
smart enough to explain it correctly let me try this way.  

Where I sit in da window I be excelr1 8ball1
Where Dandy Don sits he be excelr2 8ball2
Where Jumpin Juan sits he be excelr3 8ball3
Where Mumblin Miguel sits he be excelr4 8ball4
Where Roadhouse Rudy sits he be excelr5 8ball5

Where Ricky Ricardo sits and I guess maybe Tom May or Batman or Maybe Mark

Let's look at  their lifestyle: 
No premarital sex. 
No oral sex.  Giving or  receiving.  Never. 
No booze.  None. 
No TV.  No cable TV.  
No Spice channel.  No Playboy channel. 
No Hooters. ""What is this  Hooters of which you speak ?!?"" 
No titty bars. 
No organized sports of  any kind.  That's right-no sports. 
The women have to wear baggy dresses  and veil's.  Women have 
to cover up everything! 
Very, very, very  few cars.  Camels.  Many camels. 
Sand.  Fucking sand  everywhere! 
More sand. 
Ever fish at an oasis? 
Rags for clothes and  hats. 
Bar-B-Q's are cooked over burning camel dung chips. 
Eating with  your right hand only-because you wipe your ass 
with your left hand.  
Constant wailing from the asshole next door ... no wait, 
is that  music?  Shit!  I can't tell. 
Oh, by the way, when you die it all  gets better! ",Abusive

Subject: Isn't  it Funny
Do you  think YOU will pass it on??? 
  
  
One day Satan and  Jesus were having a conversation. Satan had just come from the Garden  of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting. ""Yes, sir, I just caught  the world full of people down there. Set me a trap, used bait I knew  they couldn't resist. Got 'em all!"" 
""What are you going to do with  them?"" Jesus asked. 
Satan replied, ""Oh, I'm gonna have fun!  I'm gonna teach them how to marry and divorce each other, how to hate  and abuse each other, how to drink and smoke and curse. I'm gonna  teach them how to invent guns and bombs and kill each other. I'm  really gonna have fun!"" 
""And what will you do when you get done  with them?"" Jesus asked. 
""Oh, I'll kill 'em,"" Satan glared proudly.  
""How much do you want for them?"" Jesus asked. 
""Oh, you don't  want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll take them and  they'll just hate you. They'll spit on you, curse you and  kill you!! You don't want those people!!"" 
""How much?"" He asked  again. 
Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, ""All your tears, and all  your blood."" 
Jesus said, ""DONE!""   Then He paid the price.  
  
Isn't it funny how simple it is for people to trash God  and then wonder why the world's going to hell.  
Isn't it funny  how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible  says.  
Isn't it funny how everyone wants to go to heaven  provided they do not have to believe, think, say, or do anything  the Bible says. Or is it scary? 
Isn't it funny how someone can  say ""I believe in God"" but still follow Satan (who, by the way, also  ""believes"" in God). 
Isn't it funny how you can send a  thousand jokes through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when  you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice  about sharing. 
Isn't it funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar  and obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but the public  discussion of Jesus is suppressed in the school and  workplace. >  Isn't it funny how someone can be so fired  up for Christ on Sunday, but be an invisible Christian the rest of the  week. 
Are you laughing? 
Isn't it funny how when you go to  forward this message, you will not send it to many on your  address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they  will think of you for sending it to them. 
Isn't it funny how I can  be more worried about what other people think of me than what God  thinks of me. 
  
 Will YOU pass this on?

This was on the editorial page on Sunday, October 28, 2001 of the Denton 
Record Chronicle (by Dwight Crawford Sr., Sanger, Tx) 
The Immunity of Texas 
I get a big laugh at the dialogue of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, 
politicians, and the news media. They say terrorists will hit us again in 
the oncoming weeks and months. What a joke! You have a better chance of 
getting killed on Interstate 35 E than by a terrorist. 
Osama has probably seen 100 degree plus summers in Afghanistan, but he 
doesn't have fire ants to go with it. If he did he wouldn't be sleeping on 
the ground in his cave. He talks of pain and suffering he is going to 
inflict on us. He doesn't know what pain is, until he gets kicked by a green 
broke, two-year-old colt in freezing rain. Germ war fare? Texas ticks will 
give you Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Lyme disease, Blister Beetles kill 
your horse, Green Bugs destroy a wheat crop, and termites eat your house. 
Anthrax has killed Texas cattle for over 125 years. So, what's new? 
Our prairie dogs carry the plague, armadillos harbor leprosy, and our bats 
and skunks threaten rabies. We have rattlesnakes, copperheads, and water 
moccasins. Ho hum. 
They talk of gas and biological warfare. They have never pulled in behind a 
cattle truck while its raining, or ridden in the front seat of a pickup 
between two cowboys, after they just eaten a big bowl of Texas Red. 
Texas ain't for sissies! We have posted signs all over the state that says, 
""Don't mess with Texas!"" Osama, consider yourself warned!

We slapped them all over the Pacific and  roasted about 2 million of them in
their own back yard. That's what we in  America call a big ass barbecue. Ever
seen Texas on a map? Ever wonder why  it's so big? Because we wanted it that
way, Mexico started jacking around  with the Alamo and now they cut our
lawns. England? We sent them packing. Ask  your buddy Saddam about fucking
with the good 'ole USA. The only reason he  got away the first time is
because it's too hard to shoot someone when you're  doubled over laughing at
them. Our soldiers aren't trained to laugh and shoot  at the same time. Now
he couldn't stop a pack of cub scouts from taking over  his shitty little
country.

Hey, here is another wonderful group of facts about women.  I don't
normally like to pass these on but it has too much importance.  Even if
your a skeptic read to the bottom.



Did you know that it's Beautiful Women Month? Well, it is and that means
you.


There are 3 billion women who don't look like supermodels . . .and only
eight who do. Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14. If Barbie was a real woman,
she'd have to walk on all fours due to her proportions. The average woman
weighs 144 lbs and wears between a 9-14. One out of every four college aged
women has an eating disorder. The models in the magazines are airbrushed --
not perfect!

A psychological study in 1995 found that three minutes spent looking at a
fashion magazine caused 70% of women to feel depressed, guilty, and
shameful.  Models twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
Today they  weigh 23% less.
 *****

Beauty of a Woman -

The beauty of a woman
Is not in the clothes she wears,
The figure she carries
Or the way she combs her hair.

The beauty of a woman
Must be seen from her eyes,
Because that is the doorway to her heart,
The place where love resides.

The beauty of a woman
Is not in a facial mole,
But true beauty in a woman
Is reflected in her soul.

It is the caring that she lovingly gives
The passion that she shows,
The beauty of a woman
With passing years - only grows.
 *****

An English professor wrote the words, ""Woman without her man is nothing,"" on
the blackboard and directed the students to punctuate it correctly.  The men
wrote: ""Woman, without her man, is nothing.""   The women wrote: ""Woman!
Without her, man is nothing.""

The Images of Mother -
4 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mommy can do anything!
8 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mom knows a lot!  A whole lot!
12 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mother doesn't really know quite everything.
14 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either.
16 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned.
18 YEARS OF AGE  ~ That old woman? She's way out of date!
25 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.
35 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.
45 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about it?
65 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.

History Month.  If you do, something good will happen...  You will Boost

Hey, here is another wonderful group of facts about women.  I don't
normally like to pass these on but it has too much importance.  Even if
your a skeptic read to the bottom.



Did you know that it's Beautiful Women Month? Well, it is and that means
you.


There are 3 billion women who don't look like supermodels . . .and only
eight who do. Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14. If Barbie was a real woman,
she'd have to walk on all fours due to her proportions. The average woman
weighs 144 lbs and wears between a 9-14. One out of every four college aged
women has an eating disorder. The models in the magazines are airbrushed --
not perfect!

A psychological study in 1995 found that three minutes spent looking at a
fashion magazine caused 70% of women to feel depressed, guilty, and
shameful.  Models twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
Today they  weigh 23% less.
 *****

Beauty of a Woman -

The beauty of a woman
Is not in the clothes she wears,
The figure she carries
Or the way she combs her hair.

The beauty of a woman
Must be seen from her eyes,
Because that is the doorway to her heart,
The place where love resides.

The beauty of a woman
Is not in a facial mole,
But true beauty in a woman
Is reflected in her soul.

It is the caring that she lovingly gives
The passion that she shows,
The beauty of a woman
With passing years - only grows.
 *****

An English professor wrote the words, ""Woman without her man is nothing,"" on
the blackboard and directed the students to punctuate it correctly.  The men
wrote: ""Woman, without her man, is nothing.""   The women wrote: ""Woman!
Without her, man is nothing.""
*****

The Images of Mother -
4 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mommy can do anything!
8 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mom knows a lot!  A whole lot!
12 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mother doesn't really know quite everything.
14 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either.
16 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned.
18 YEARS OF AGE  ~ That old woman? She's way out of date!
25 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.
35 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.
45 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about it?
65 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.

Please send this to five phenomenal women today in celebration of Women's
History Month.  If you do, something good will happen...  You will Boost
another woman's self-esteem.",Abusive

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."" 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

Sandra,

My cousin sent me this.  It is so stupid but it made me laugh.

By the way the orthodontist called me last night.  What is he thinking?  I
was not home thank goodness.  SOLD!!!!!

I am not signed onto instant messenger.  I am doing some research this
morning.  I am really nervous about my interview today.

How was the massage?

Sandra,

My cousin sent me this.  It is so stupid but it made me laugh.

By the way the orthodontist called me last night.  What is he thinking?  I
was not home thank goodness.  SOLD!!!!!

I am not signed onto instant messenger.  I am doing some research this
morning.  I am really nervous about my interview today.

How was the massage?

Sandra,

My cousin sent me this.  It is so stupid but it made me laugh.

By the way the orthodontist called me last night.  What is he thinking?  I
was not home thank goodness.  SOLD!!!!!

I am not signed onto instant messenger.  I am doing some research this
morning.  I am really nervous about my interview today.

How was the massage?

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."" 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."" 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

Sandra,

My cousin sent me this.  It is so stupid but it made me laugh.

By the way the orthodontist called me last night.  What is he thinking?  I
was not home thank goodness.  SOLD!!!!!

I am not signed onto instant messenger.  I am doing some research this
morning.  I am really nervous about my interview today.

How was the massage?

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."" 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

You are going to love this one!  From a friend in California.

Akhmed came to the United States from Afghanistan, and he
was only here a few months when he became very ill.  He went
to doctor after doctor, but none of them could help him.

Finally, he went to an Arab doctor.  The doctor said,
""Take dees bucket, go into de odder room, shit in de bucket,
piss on de shit, and den put  your head down over de bucket
and breathe in de fumes for ten minutes.""

Akmed took the bucket, went into the other room, shit
in the  bucket, pissed on the shit, bent over and breathed
in the fumes for ten minutes.

Coming back to the doctor he said, ""It worked. I feel
terrific!   What was it?""

The doctor said, ""You were homesick.""

     COPIED FROM A NEWSGROUP POSTING - (the author is responding to a
woman who accidentally walked into the men's restroom):

     Please don't feel bad. It wasn't you entering the men's washroom
that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the
time. It's rare us guys ever hit what were aiming for.

     Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start
spinning around; just so I'll make sure I hit something.

     You see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men's
penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because
all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his
penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his
left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I'm telling 'ya those little buggers can't
be trusted.

     After being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I'm no longer
allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee.
She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she had
gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee soaked
toilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat
down, she was going to kill me in my sleep.

     Now another thing us guys don't usually like to talk about, but
because you and I have become such good friends and you think I'm a classy
guy, I might as well be candid with you because it's a real problem, and you
ladies need to be understanding. It's the dreaded ""morning wood"".

     Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire
to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter
how hard you try, you can't get that thing to bend, and if it won't bend you
can't aim, well hell, if you can't aim you have no choice but to piss all
over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on
putting on the toilet.

     And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers,
the friggin' toilet seat won't stay up by itself. So that means we have to
use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control
our less than perfect aim.

     Now sometimes, when you're newly married, (and I know the guys in
here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with
that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy
thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that
compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet
seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys will
not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it's just not safe.

     I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I
told her... look, it won't bend. She said, ""so sit down like I told you to
do all the rest of the time."" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with
""morning wood"".

     Well it's is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and
before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on
the wall across the room.

     Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down
under the toilet seat, when you start to pee the pee shoots out from the
crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You
piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs
on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor
in front of the toilet.

     I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning
urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position laying over the
toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split
time precision but it's the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl
during the first morning pee.

     So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to
blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom
cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control.

     It's not our fault, it's just Mother Nature.

     Now, if it was Father Nature, there wouldn't have been a problem!!!

Chickens are misled into believing there is a road by the evil
tiremakers. Chickens aren't ignorant, but our society pays tiremakers to
create the need for these roads and then lures chickens into believing
there is an advantage to crossing them.  Down with the roads, up with
chickens.

PAT BUCHANAN
To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.

JERRY FALWELL
Because the chicken was gay!  Isn't it obvious? Can't you people See the
plain truth in front of your face?  The chicken was going to the ""other
side."" That's what ""they"" call it-the ""other side."" Yes, my friends, that
chicken is gay.  And, if you eat that chicken, you
will become gay too.  I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out
this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless
phrases like ""the other side."" That chicken should not be free to cross the
road.  It's as plain and simple as that.

DR.  SEUSS
Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes!  The
chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told!

ERNEST HEMINGWAY
To die.  In the rain.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross without having
their motives called into question.

GRANDPA
In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  Someone told us
that the chicken crossed the road,and that was good enough for us.

ARISTOTLE
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

KARL MARX
It was a historical inevitability.

SADDAM HUSSEIN
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in
dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

RONALD REAGAN
What chicken?

CAPTAIN JAMES T.  KIRK
To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

FOX MULDER
You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens
have to cross before you believe it?

FREUD
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road
reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES
I have just released eChicken 2000, which will not only cross roads, but
will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook
-and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.

EINSTEIN
Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the
chicken?

BILL CLINTON
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken.  What do you mean by
""chicken""? Could you define ""chicken"" please?

GEORGE BUSH
I don't think I should have to answer that question.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN
The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed
the ""black man"" in order to trample him and keep him down.

10. Keep telling the same person they have bad breath
      even if they don't, and then punch them in the face.

  9. Announce in a meeting that you have AIDS. After
      everyone gives you the sympathy remarks, tell everyone
      you were kidding and call them a bunch of queers.

  8. Before a meeting, fill your mouth with custard. In the
     meeting pretend you're hocking up a loogie, spit it into
      a glass and hand it to the person next to you and say
      ""BEAT THAT!""

  7. Inform a male co-worker that he would make a good
      hooker, then piss in his coffee and tell him he needs a
      good ass fucking.

   6. Always walk around with a big smile and keep one hand
       down the front of your pants.

   5. Answer every question with "" Fucked if I know..."",
       then call the person a racial slur that doesn't even match
       their race

   4. Brag about the fact that you carry a gun, and keep
       playing with your nuts. Get them really sweaty and go
       around shaking everyone's hand.

    3. Run down the hall with your dick out spraying piss
        everywhere yelling ""It wont stop! God help me it wont
        stop!"" Then when it does, look down and say, ""Oh! I must have
        broke it.""

     2. Ask to borrow a co-worker's expensive pen- Bring it
         to the bathroom and stick it up your ass- return it to
         the person and tell them that it smells bad and tell them to
         smell it- when they say that it smells, say ""It should - - I
had it up
         my ass!""

     1. Shit on your office floor and when someone comes in
         and sees it tell them it's the fake rubber kind. When they try
         to pick it up and realize that their hand is full of real shit
- - laugh

Approximately 10 gallons of liquid came in with the pigs but, for the most

hopefully some of the photos will show enough detail to give you all an idea 
of the extent of the wear.  Samples (both wipe and liquids/sludge) were 
collected as per your direction.  Wipes on the top and bottom of the leading

When Ryan and I got to the ranch, the guide gave us both a bull tag instead 
of a cow tag and said we had the run of the ranch and we could shoot anything 
we wanted, bulls or cows.  I took your word and didnt shoot your gun, which 
was a duel mistake, trusting your word and trusting your gun.  I saw several 
big bulls during our 4 day stay on the ranch and am reporting to you that due 
to my trust in you, and that jap junk rifle,  I never hit anything. Have you 
had anything in your life that would compare to the emptiness and frustration 
of shooting at monster bulls for four days and not hitting anything but dirt 
and trees?  Not only that, but on the way home, I wreaked my truck and died 
on the way to the hospital.  Im in heaven now, and spending my time putting

     COPIED FROM A NEWSGROUP POSTING - (the author is responding to a
woman who accidentally walked into the men's restroom):

     Please don't feel bad. It wasn't you entering the men's washroom
that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the
time. It's rare us guys ever hit what were aiming for.

     Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start
spinning around; just so I'll make sure I hit something.

     You see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men's
penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because
all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his
penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his
left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I'm telling 'ya those little buggers can't
be trusted.

     After being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I'm no longer
allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee.
She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she had
gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee soaked
toilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat
down, she was going to kill me in my sleep.

     Now another thing us guys don't usually like to talk about, but
because you and I have become such good friends and you think I'm a classy
guy, I might as well be candid with you because it's a real problem, and you
ladies need to be understanding. It's the dreaded ""morning wood"".

     Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire
to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter
how hard you try, you can't get that thing to bend, and if it won't bend you
can't aim, well hell, if you can't aim you have no choice but to piss all
over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on
putting on the toilet.

     And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers,
the friggin' toilet seat won't stay up by itself. So that means we have to
use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control
our less than perfect aim.

     Now sometimes, when you're newly married, (and I know the guys in
here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with
that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy
thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that
compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet
seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys will
not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it's just not safe.

     I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I
told her... look, it won't bend. She said, ""so sit down like I told you to
do all the rest of the time."" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with
""morning wood"".

     Well it's is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and
before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on
the wall across the room.

     Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down
under the toilet seat, when you start to pee the pee shoots out from the
crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You
piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs
on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor
in front of the toilet.

     I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning
urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position laying over the
toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split
time precision but it's the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl
during the first morning pee.

     So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to
blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom
cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control.

     It's not our fault, it's just Mother Nature.

     Now, if it was Father Nature, there wouldn't have been a problem!!!

I fight for the chickens and I am fighting for the chickens right now. I
will not give up on the chickens crossing the road!  I will fight for the
chickens and I will not disappoint them.

GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH
I don't believe we need to get the chickens across the road.  I say give
the road to the chickens and let them decide.  The government needs to let
go of strangling the chickens so they can get across
the road.

SENATOR LIEBERMAN
I believe that every chicken has the right to worship their God In their
own way.  Crossing the road is a spiritual journey and no chicken should be
denied the right to cross the road in their own
way.

SECRETARY CHENEY
Chickens are big-time because they have wings. They could fly if they
wanted to.  Chickens don't want to cross the road.  They don't need help
crossing the road.  In fact, I'm not interested in crossing the road
myself.

RALPH NADER
Chickens are misled into believing there is a road by the evil
tiremakers. Chickens aren't ignorant, but our society pays tiremakers to
create the need for these roads and then lures chickens into believing
there is an advantage to crossing them.  Down with the roads, up with
chickens.

PAT BUCHANAN
To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.

JERRY FALWELL
Because the chicken was gay!  Isn't it obvious? Can't you people See the
plain truth in front of your face?  The chicken was going to the ""other
side."" That's what ""they"" call it-the ""other side."" Yes, my friends, that
chicken is gay.  And, if you eat that chicken, you
will become gay too.  I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out
this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless
phrases like ""the other side."" That chicken should not be free to cross the
road.  It's as plain and simple as that.

DR.  SEUSS
Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes!  The
chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told!

ERNEST HEMINGWAY
To die.  In the rain.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross without having
their motives called into question.

GRANDPA
In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  Someone told us
that the chicken crossed the road,and that was good enough for us.

ARISTOTLE
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

KARL MARX
It was a historical inevitability.

SADDAM HUSSEIN
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in
dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

RONALD REAGAN
What chicken?

CAPTAIN JAMES T.  KIRK
To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

FOX MULDER
You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens
have to cross before you believe it?

FREUD
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road
reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES
I have just released eChicken 2000, which will not only cross roads, but
will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook
-and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.

EINSTEIN
Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the
chicken?

BILL CLINTON
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken.  What do you mean by
""chicken""? Could you define ""chicken"" please?

GEORGE BUSH
I don't think I should have to answer that question.

mainline in section 4.  These are pigs Coastal oversized per piping specs.  
Approximately 10 gallons of liquid came in with the pigs but, for the most 
part it was in a sludge form.  The pigs are worn as you would expect and 
hopefully some of the photos will show enough detail to give you all an idea 
of the extent of the wear.  Samples (both wipe and liquids/sludge) were 
collected as per your direction.  Wipes on the top and bottom of the leading 
rubber on both the first and second pigs.  One liquid sample collected in 
front of first pig and a second liquid sample collected in front of the 
second pig.  This pigs ran fast (approximately 85 miles in 7 hours).  We had 
920 mmcfd flow half of which was flowing in the loop and the other half in 
the main line.

BAD AMERICAN
Date: Fri, 29 Jun 2001 Written by Ted Nugent, the rock singer
and hunter/naturalist, upon hearing that California
Senators B. Boxer and D. Feinstein denounced him for being a
""gun owner"" and a ""Rock Star"".
This was his response after telling the senators about his past
contributions to children's charities and scholarship foundations
which have totaled more than $13.7 million in the last 5 years!!
""I'm a Bad American-this pretty much sums it up for me. I like
big trucks, big boats, big houses, and naturally, pretty women.
I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not
some midlevel governmental functionary with a bad comb-over
who wants to give it away to crack addicts squirting out babies.
I don't care about appearing compassionate. I think playing
with toy guns doesn't make you a killer. I believe ignoring
your kids and giving them Prozac might.
I think I'm doing better than the homeless.
I don't think being a minority makes you noble or victimized.
I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are
different, weird or make me mad. This is my life to live, and
not necessarily up to others expectations.
I know what SEX is and there are not varying degrees of it.
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa. But if you want to that's fine;
I just don't feel like everyone else should have to.
I believe that if you are selling me a Dairy Queen shake, a
pack of cigarettes, or hotel room you should do it in English.
As of matter of fact, if you are an American citizen you should
speak English. My uncles and forefathers shouldn't have had
to die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born
in to come disrespect ours, and make us bend to your will.
Get over it.
I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry butt if
you're running from them after they tell you to stop. If
you can't understand the word 'freeze' or 'stop' in English,
see the previous line.
I don't use the excuse ""it's for the children"" as a shield for
unpopular opinions or actions.
I know how to count votes and I feel much safer letting a
machine with no political affiliation do a recount when needed.
I know what the definition of lying is, and it isn't based on
the word ""is""-ever.
I don't think just because you were not born in this country,
you qualify for any special loan programs, gov't sponsored
bank loans, etc., so you can open a hotel, 7-Eleven, trinket shop,
or any thing else, while the indigenous peoples can't get past
a high school education because they can't afford it.
I didn't take the initiative in inventing the Internet.
I thought the Taco Bell dog was funny.
I want them to bring back safe and sane fireworks.
I believe no one ever died because of something Ozzy Osbourne,
Ice-T or Marilyn Manson sang, but that doesn't mean I want to
listen to that crap from someone else's car when I'm stopped at a 
red light. But I respect your right to.
I think that being a student doesn't give you any more enlightenment
than working at Blockbuster or Jack In The Box.
I don't want to eat or drink anything with the words light, lite
or fat-free on the package.
Our soldiers did not go to some foreign country and risk their
lives in vain and defend our Constitution so that decades later
you can tell me it's a living document ever changing and is open
to interpretation. The guys who wrote it were light years
ahead of anyone today, and they meant what they said - now
leave the document alone, or there's going to be trouble.
I don't hate the rich. I help the poor.
I know wrestling is fake.
I've never owned, or was a slave, and a large percentage of
our forefathers weren't wealthy enough to own one either.
Please stop blaming me because some prior white people were
idiots - and remember, tons of white, Indian, Chinese, and
other races have been enslaved too - it was wrong for every
one of them.
I believe a self-righteous liberal Democrat with a cause is
more dangerous than a Hell's Angel with an attitude.
I want to know exactly which church is it where the
""Reverend"" Jessie Jackson preaches; and, what exactly is
his job function.
I own a gun, you can own a gun, and any red blooded American
should be allowed to own a gun, but if you use it in a crime,
then you will serve the time.
I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made
and continue to make more. If it makes you mad, then invent
the next operating system that's better and put your name on
the building. Ask your buddy that invented the Internet to
help you.
I don't believe in hate crime legislation. Even suggesting
it makes me mad. You're telling me that someone who is a
minority, gay, disabled, another nationality, or otherwise
different from the mainstream of this country has more value
as a human being that I do as a white male. If someone
kills anyone, I'd say that it's a hate crime. We don't need
more laws! Let's enforce the ones we already have.
I think turkey bacon, turkey beef, turkey fake anything sucks.
I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child-it
takes a parent with the guts to stand up to the kid and spank
his butt and say ""NO!"" when it's necessary to do so.
I'll admit that the only movie that ever made me cry was Ole Yeller.
I didn't realize Dr. Seuss was a genius until I had a kid.
I will not be frowned upon or be looked down upon or be made
to keep silent because I have these beliefs and opinions.
I thought this country allowed me that right.
I will not conform or compromise just to keep from hurting
somebody's feelings.
I'm neither angry nor disenfranchised, no matter how desperately the
 mainstream media would like the world to believe otherwise.
Yes, I guess by some people's definition, I may be a bad American. But that's tough.""

At risk of sounding like a pain in the arse, we do need to get that damn 
boat out of here for this weekend's festivities. It's fine to have a Zodiac 
in the living room, if you live in a place like Medecino, but in a city as 
sophisticated as SF, it really does look declasse.

Everyone probably pitched in, right?  Sounds American as...

That's scary about Annie- I guess she is OK now.

I want the huckles - I would have made a sauce with them like I was going to
do last time (but you guys forgot and made other plans with Tom & Karen).

Neapolitan Pork Roast with Potatoes 

6 - 8 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
2 Tbs (30 ml) chopped fresh sage leaves or 2 tsp (10 ml) dried sage 
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 
1 boneless pork loin roast, 2 to 3 pounds (1 to 1.5 Kg)
2 lbs (1 Kg) potatoes, cut into 1-inch (3 cm) cubes 
2 Tbs (30 ml) olive oil 

Combine the garlic, sage, salt and pepper in a small bowl.? Make holes 
in the pork roast with a small paring knife and stuff the garlic 
mixture in the holes with your finger, reserving about 1 teaspoon (5
ml) of the garlic mixture.? Rub any remaining garlic mixture on the 
outside of the roast.? Toss the potatoes with the reserved garlic 
mixture and the olive oil.? Place the roast and the potatoes in a 
roasting pan and place in a preheated 425F (220C) oven.? Remove from 
the oven and stir the potatoes after 30 minutes.? Baste the roast with 
the pan juices and return to the oven.? Lower the heat to 325F (160C) 
and continue to cook, stirring the potatoes and basting the roast 
about every 15 minutes.? Begin checking the internal temperature of 
the roast after about 1 1/4 hours total cooking time.? Remove the 
roast when the internal temperature is 140F (65C) for meat that is 
still slightly pink.? Let the roast rest for 15 minutes before carving.? 
Return the potatoes to the oven if
they are not crisp and golden. Serves 6 to 8.

Peter Granoff:

moment like a fine wine.=20

Maire Murphy:
When we describe wine, we describe its body, texture, taste, and=20
experience. That, in itself, is romantic.=20

Diana Jacklich:
Ever wonder why wine language is rife with such adjectives as sexy,=20
seductive, smooth, velvety, and lush? Because wine is one of the last=20
legal sybaritic pursuits.=20

Carolyn Dempsey:
Wine evokes sensory pleasure and sustenance, which lift the spirit=20
and return us to what really matters. Whether it's the nourishment of=20
breaking bread and sharing stories, or simply the nurturing nature of=20
wine itself (which eases the mind and soothes the soul), it's about=20

Maire Murphy:
There exist some dessert wines that must be sipped only from a=20

and when you bring it to your lips....=20

Taking Peter's cue, Tim Gaiser provides further dining advice:
If Champagne is our most romantic wine, there's no better occasion=20
than Valentine's Day for a Champagne dinner. It enables you to (1)=20
serve everything at the same time and (2) not do any cooking=20
whatsoever. Just pick up a bottle or two of your favorite bubbly,=20
plus an assortment of caviar, cheeses, pates, fresh shellfish, smoked=20
trout/salmon/scallops, chocolates, and any other finger food that=20
strikes your fancy. Invite that special someone to the table, open=20

		 Subject: Re-cap of Rep Caucus Briefing

The Republican Caucus briefing Thursday was well attended, and members were
appreciative of the fact that Jan and other members of IEP took the time to
brief them.  The feedback we've heard from Republican Leader Bill Campbell's
office and others is that the handouts IEP provided were great, and the
presentations very informative.  In fact, several members acknowledged that
they had never heard the message communicated in such a clear, concise way.

Just fyi, one issue that is on the radar screen of Republicans is the fact
that generators have not been paid -- yet they still continue to supply
electricity to California.

We have offered to brief the Democrat Caucus, but they have not expressed
interest thus far.  We will continue trying!

Below is a list of those who attended the meeting.

Thanks,
Jean

easy too and uses our beautiful sage.? It was in my e-mail this morning.

Neapolitan Pork Roast with Potatoes 

6 - 8 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
2 Tbs (30 ml) chopped fresh sage leaves or 2 tsp (10 ml) dried sage 
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 
1 boneless pork loin roast, 2 to 3 pounds (1 to 1.5 Kg)
2 lbs (1 Kg) potatoes, cut into 1-inch (3 cm) cubes 
2 Tbs (30 ml) olive oil 

Combine the garlic, sage, salt and pepper in a small bowl.? Make holes 
in the pork roast with a small paring knife and stuff the garlic 
mixture in the holes with your finger, reserving about 1 teaspoon (5
ml) of the garlic mixture.? Rub any remaining garlic mixture on the 
outside of the roast.? Toss the potatoes with the reserved garlic 
mixture and the olive oil.? Place the roast and the potatoes in a 
roasting pan and place in a preheated 425F (220C) oven.? Remove from 
the oven and stir the potatoes after 30 minutes.? Baste the roast with 
the pan juices and return to the oven.? Lower the heat to 325F (160C) 
and continue to cook, stirring the potatoes and basting the roast 
about every 15 minutes.? Begin checking the internal temperature of 
the roast after about 1 1/4 hours total cooking time.? Remove the 
roast when the internal temperature is 140F (65C) for meat that is 
still slightly pink.? Let the roast rest for 15 minutes before carving.? 
Return the potatoes to the oven if
they are not crisp and golden. Serves 6 to 8.

Wine and Romance

Everybody seems to agree that wine and romance go hand in hand, so we=20
asked our Wine Team - a seasoned group of experts boasting 150 years=20
of collective experience - exactly why and how love and wine are=20
linked. Here are their professional observations.=20

Lee Codding:
Wine is made with care and passion, which can't help but transmit=20
itself to the drinker. It's only natural for wine to have a central=20
place in romance, because love is an essential ingredient in=20
its production.=20

Peter Granoff:
Candy may be dandy and liquor quicker, but nothing extends a romantic=20
moment like a fine wine.=20

Maire Murphy:
When we describe wine, we describe its body, texture, taste, and=20
experience. That, in itself, is romantic.=20

Diana Jacklich:
Ever wonder why wine language is rife with such adjectives as sexy,=20
seductive, smooth, velvety, and lush? Because wine is one of the last=20
legal sybaritic pursuits.=20

Carolyn Dempsey:
Wine evokes sensory pleasure and sustenance, which lift the spirit=20
and return us to what really matters. Whether it's the nourishment of=20
breaking bread and sharing stories, or simply the nurturing nature of=20
wine itself (which eases the mind and soothes the soul), it's about=20
taking time to savor the beautiful.=20

Maire Murphy:
There exist some dessert wines that must be sipped only from a=20
woman's navel. If that isn't romantic, what is?=20

Julian Davies:
Of course, no woman in her right mind would drop her laundry without=20
half a bottle of '47 Cheval Blanc down her....=20

Peter Granoff:
Wine lovers are wrong when they say that great wine is like sex.=20
Great wine is sex. The delicacy and tenderness involved in opening a=20
fine old bottle of wine is a kind of foreplay, and great wine, like=20
the act of love, engages us on many levels: sensory, emotional,=20
and intellectual.=20

Diana Jacklich:
""The soft extractive note of an aged cork being withdrawn has the=20
true sound of a man opening his heart"" (William Samuel Benwell).=20

Jeff Prather:
Wine makes us giddy with youthful energy; it makes us feel warm and=20
fuzzy; it causes us to say silly things and mean them; it reduces our=20
inhibitions; it's a sensual magnifier; it's a powerful muse; it makes=20
everything taste better. Oh, did I say wine? Well then, wine must be=20
bottled love.=20

Peter Granoff:
Romance engages all the senses -- as does a fluted glass of=20
Champagne, especially when savored by candlelight. It's a sensory=20
treat in all respects: It sparkles like the eyes of your beloved,=20
offers the same delight to the nose as the object of your affection,=20
and when you bring it to your lips....=20

Taking Peter's cue, Tim Gaiser provides further dining advice:
If Champagne is our most romantic wine, there's no better occasion=20
than Valentine's Day for a Champagne dinner. It enables you to (1)=20
serve everything at the same time and (2) not do any cooking=20
whatsoever. Just pick up a bottle or two of your favorite bubbly,=20
plus an assortment of caviar, cheeses, pates, fresh shellfish, smoked=20
trout/salmon/scallops, chocolates, and any other finger food that=20
strikes your fancy. Invite that special someone to the table, open=20
the first bottle, and simply let nature, romance, intimate=20
conversation, true love, and amateur wrestling take their course.=20

		 Subject: Re-cap of Rep Caucus Briefing

The Republican Caucus briefing Thursday was well attended, and members were
appreciative of the fact that Jan and other members of IEP took the time to
brief them.  The feedback we've heard from Republican Leader Bill Campbell's
office and others is that the handouts IEP provided were great, and the
presentations very informative.  In fact, several members acknowledged that
they had never heard the message communicated in such a clear, concise way.

Just fyi, one issue that is on the radar screen of Republicans is the fact
that generators have not been paid -- yet they still continue to supply
electricity to California.

We have offered to brief the Democrat Caucus, but they have not expressed
interest thus far.  We will continue trying!

Below is a list of those who attended the meeting.

Thanks,
Jean

Effective October 1st...BPA transmission will be the following prices...

BPA non-firm point to point (or network) will be $2.92 with 1.9% losses

BPA non-firm on the intertie will be $3.34 with 3% losses

Losses could be expected to add up to $5 of the total price--do not put losses into the purchase from BPA Transmission in Enpower--losses for BPA will be settled at the end of the month in a single annuity.

Total price for MPC to CAISO at MALIN on BPA non-firm all the way will be $6.26
Total price for MPC to CAISO at NOB on BPA NON-FIRM all the way will be $6.26--Remember to check tranny sheet for PGE-tranny availability--WE HAVE NO MORE LT FIRM FROM BIG EDDY TO NOB--

SNOPud is charging $3.25 for point to point plus 1.9% losses.

Bill

Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk"". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

Subject: ""Texas Chili""



I have it on good authority that this is a true story; A True Texas Story: 



???????????????These are notes from an inexperienced chili 
taster named FRANK, who was visiting Texas from New Jersey... 
""Recently I was lucky enough to be the 10,000th attendee at the State 
Fair in Texas and was asked to fill in to be a judge at a chili 
cook-off. ??Apparently the original Judge #3 called in sick at the 
last moment, and I happened to be standing there when the call came 
in. ?I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that it 
would be a fun event and a true taste of Texas hospitality. ?They 
assured me that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, 
they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I 
accepted. ?Here are the scorecards from the event."" 

???*****Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili 
???????????????????????JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. 
Amusing kick. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very 
mild. 
???????????????FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You 
could remove dried paint from your driveway with it. Took me two 
beers to put the flames out. ?Hope that's the worst one. These Texans 
are crazy  
???*****Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight 
Jalapeno tang. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to 
be taken seriously. 
???????????????FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! 
I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave 
off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had 
to walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on my face. 

???*****Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. 
Needs more beans. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty,good use of 
red peppers. 
???????????????FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill.  
My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the 
routine by now. ?Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is 
in the front part of my chest. ?I'm getting shit-faced. 

??????*****Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice.  
Disappointing. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side 
dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili. 
???????????????FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, 
but was unable to taste it. ?Sally, the bar maid, was standing 
behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look 
HOT,just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating. 

?????*****Chili # 5: Linda's Lethal Lip Remover 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers 
freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more 
tomato. ?Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. 
???????????????FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus 
my eyes. ?I farted and four people behind me burst into flames. 
The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had 
given me brain damage. ?Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by 
pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. ?It really pisses me off 
that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. ?Screw those 
rednecks! 

?????????*****Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili.  
Good balance of spice and peppers. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: The best yet. ?Aggressive use of peppers, 
onions, and garlic. ?Superb. ? 
???????????????FRANK: My intestines are now a straight-pipe filled 
with gaseous, sulfuric flames. ?No one seems inclined to stand behind 
me except that slut Sally. ?I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone! 

?????????***Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on 
canned peppers. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally 
threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note 
that I am worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of 
distress as he is cursing uncontrollably. 
???????????????FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the 
pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one 
eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt 
is covered with chili that slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants 
are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during 
the autopsy they'll know what killed me. ?I've decided to stop 
breathing. ?It's too painful. ?Screw it! ?I'm not getting any anyway. 
If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my 
stomach. 

???????????????*****Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili 

???????????????JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending... this is a nice blend 
chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare its 
existence. 
???????????????JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced 
chili, neither mild nor hot. ?Sorry to see that most of it was lost 
when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top 
of himself. ?Not sure if he's going to make it. ?Poor Yank.

lifornia PUC will review whether they should revise the  baseline amount of=
 electricity used by residential customers that is  considered essential an=

ear-old formula for calculating  minimum power needs for California homes. =
On May 15, the PUC set  rates so people who exceed their baseline by a cert=
ain amount pay  more. The level is defined as 50% - 60% of average resident=
ial use  for customers with electricity and natural gas, and 60% - 70% of  =
average use for homes run solely by electricity.      =20

Yo Mama`s so fat ....



Your mama is so fat:
When she hauls ass she has to make two trips.
When she dances she makes the band skip.
When she was diagnosed with the flesh eating disease the doctor gave her

13 years to live.

She puts mayonnaise on aspirin. (<- clearly the winner)
Her cereal bowl came with a lifeguard.
When she goes to the zoo the elephants throw her peanuts.
Her high school graduation picture was an aerial photograph.
Her driver`s license says ""Picture continued on other side.""
She has to iron her pants on the driveway.
The back of her neck looks like a pack of hot dogs.
Yo mama`s so fat, all the restaurants in town have signs that say:
""Maximum Occupancy: 240 Patrons OR Yo Mama""
Yo mama`s so fat, when she ran away, they had to use all four sides of
the milk carton.
Yo mama`s so fat, instead of Levis 501 jeans, she wears Levi`s 1002`s.
Yo mama`s so fat, when she gets in an elevator, it HAS to go down.
Yo mama`s so fat, she was born with a silver shovel in her mouth.
Yo mama`s so fat, she`s got smaller fat women orbiting around her.
Yo mama`s so fat, she could sell shade.

Yo Mama`s so fat ....



Your mama is so fat:
When she hauls ass she has to make two trips.
When she dances she makes the band skip.
When she was diagnosed with the flesh eating disease the doctor gave her

13 years to live.

She puts mayonnaise on aspirin. (<- clearly the winner)
Her cereal bowl came with a lifeguard.
When she goes to the zoo the elephants throw her peanuts.
Her high school graduation picture was an aerial photograph.
Her driver`s license says ""Picture continued on other side.""
She has to iron her pants on the driveway.
The back of her neck looks like a pack of hot dogs.
Yo mama`s so fat, all the restaurants in town have signs that say:
""Maximum Occupancy: 240 Patrons OR Yo Mama""
Yo mama`s so fat, when she ran away, they had to use all four sides of
the milk carton.
Yo mama`s so fat, instead of Levis 501 jeans, she wears Levi`s 1002`s.
Yo mama`s so fat, when she gets in an elevator, it HAS to go down.
Yo mama`s so fat, she was born with a silver shovel in her mouth.
Yo mama`s so fat, she`s got smaller fat women orbiting around her.
Yo mama`s so fat, she could sell shade.

Hope you found a great place to live. It is ridiculous how expensive flats 
are in London. Thank god your making pounds now.

Tahoe was too much traveling for that short of a stay.  Good weather, good 
friends, beautiful scenery, all right snowboarding, shitty food, cheesy 
casinos and too much time in fucking airports. That about summarizes the 
weekend. 

Laird is doing fine. Things have been relatively slow and the market is very 
choppy. I've been pretty quiet. No major axes to grind. Just trying to look 
for the next big trade and keep from getting my head ripped off on EOL.

You have to go out for Middle Eastern food. Go to The Lebanese Restaurant. I

The next day the daughter was riding with her boy friend and he said ""My hands are freezing cold."" The girl replied, ""Put them between my legs.

The following day the boyfriend was again in the buggy with the daughter.
He said ""My nose is cold."" The girl replied ""Put it between my legs.

The next day the boyfriend was again driving with the daughter and he said, ""My penis is frozen solid.""

I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will ""water out"" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

      4. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in 
public. 
      5. I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to worship 
me. 
      6. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter. 
      7. I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message... 
      8. I don't work here. I'm a consultant. 
      9. It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're 
saying. 
      10. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of crap. 
      11. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid. 
      12. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers. 
      13. I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't give a damn. 
      14. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth. 
      15. I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you. 
      16. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely 
coincidental. 
      17. What am I? Flypaper for freaks!? 
      18. I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant. 
      19. It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off. 
      20. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial. 
      21. And your cry baby whiny-ass opinion would be...? 
      22. Do I look like a people person? 
      23. This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting. 
      24. I started out with nothing & still have most of it left. 
      25. Sarcasm is just one more service we offer. 
      26. If I throw a stick, will you leave? 
      27. Errors have been made. Others will be blamed. 
      28. Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed. 
      29. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality. 
      30. A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door. 
      31. Can I trade this job for what's behind door #1? 
      32. Too many freaks, not enough circuses. 
      33. Nice perfume. Must you marinate in it? 
      34. Chaos, panic, & disorder -- my work here is done. 
      35. How do I set a laser printer to stun? 
      36. I thought I wanted a career, turns out I just wanted pay checks. 
      37. Your village just called..... their idiot is missing. ",Abusive

How are things going? I trust that you are adjusting relatively easily. 

Things have been relatively quiet lately. Doing a little snowboarding and 
watching lots of movies. Trying to drag my lazy ass to the gym at least 4 
days a week. So far I'm at one in a row. Things are looking good for a repeat 
today.

now.

Hope you found a great place to live. It is ridiculous how expensive flats 
are in London. Thank god your making pounds now.

Tahoe was too much traveling for that short of a stay.  Good weather, good 
friends, beautiful scenery, all right snowboarding, shitty food, cheesy 
casinos and too much time in fucking airports. That about summarizes the 
weekend. 

Laird is doing fine. Things have been relatively slow and the market is very 
choppy. I've been pretty quiet. No major axes to grind. Just trying to look 
for the next big trade and keep from getting my head ripped off on EOL.

You have to go out for Middle Eastern food. Go to The Lebanese Restaurant. I 
think it is on Oxford street but I'll find out for sure. Also try Ranoush 
Juice for a falafel.

A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.

bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.",Abusive

I received a call from Carl Drachenberg with HMS at approximately 1:45 PM on 
6/13/00 stating that he pulled a stick on meter #986315 and it was wet and 
flowing at 35 lb. I asked Gary Hanks what we want to do and he said to have 
Carl notify the producer and shut it in.   I notified Carl and he got in 
touch with the producer and they shut the compressor down at approx. 2 PM on 
6/13 and at that time there wasn't any flow.  Carl came back out there at 8 
AM on 6/14 and closed the valve and removed the chart. There was no flow 
after they shut the unit down and it was flowing between 500 and 300 mcf.  
The meter is now out of service.

Any questions - you know where to find me.

6/13/00 stating that he pulled a stick on meter #986315 and it was wet and 
flowing at 35 lb. I asked Gary Hanks what we want to do and he said to have 
Carl notify the producer and shut it in.   I notified Carl and he got in 
touch with the producer and they shut the compressor down at approx. 2 PM on 
6/13 and at that time there wasn't any flow.  Carl came back out there at 8 
AM on 6/14 and closed the valve and removed the chart. There was no flow 
after they shut the unit down and it was flowing between 500 and 300 mcf.  
The meter is now out of service.

There was a trader at the party that weighed about 320.   He was wearing a black wool sportcoat and a khaki colored shirt.    He tried to take his coat off but strangers were dogging him about his sweat rings,  so he put it back on..........poor bastard.

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with

Subject: Commission Adopts New Rules for OCS Pipelines


At the meeting this morning, the Commission issued new regulations under the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for Pipelines on the Outer Continental 
Shelf (RM99-5). 

In a nutshell, the rules add new reporting requirements for offshore pipes  
in order to level the playing field with offshore pipelines that are 
regulated under the Natural Gas Act.  

In an important change from the NOPR, the rule exempts from these new 
requirements offshore pipelines that are already regulated under NGA (i.e. 
there will not be dual reporting requirements).

Commissioner Breathitt explained that while this is a modest step and doesn't 
address all OCS issues, she feels like this  provides a light-handed 
regulatory alternative for regulating offshore pipes.

Subject: Commission Adopts New Rules for OCS Pipelines


At the meeting this morning, the Commission issued new regulations under the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for Pipelines on the Outer Continental 
Shelf (RM99-5). 

In a nutshell, the rules add new reporting requirements for offshore pipes  
in order to level the playing field with offshore pipelines that are 
regulated under the Natural Gas Act.  

In an important change from the NOPR, the rule exempts from these new 
requirements offshore pipelines that are already regulated under NGA (i.e. 
there will not be dual reporting requirements).

Commissioner Breathitt explained that while this is a modest step and doesn't 
address all OCS issues, she feels like this  provides a light-handed 
regulatory alternative for regulating offshore pipes.

Subject: Commission Adopts New Rules for OCS Pipelines


At the meeting this morning, the Commission issued new regulations under the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for Pipelines on the Outer Continental 
Shelf (RM99-5). 

In a nutshell, the rules add new reporting requirements for offshore pipes  
in order to level the playing field with offshore pipelines that are 
regulated under the Natural Gas Act.  

In an important change from the NOPR, the rule exempts from these new 
requirements offshore pipelines that are already regulated under NGA (i.e. 
there will not be dual reporting requirements).

Commissioner Breathitt explained that while this is a modest step and doesn't 
address all OCS issues, she feels like this  provides a light-handed 
regulatory alternative for regulating offshore pipes.

Subject: RSVP: August 25 - Introduction to the Electric Industry


By now I'm sure that you've heard about the upcoming electric industry class 
that has been customized for GPG staff.   The purpose of the class is to 
learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the 
current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn 
about the economics of electric generation.   

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with 
remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in 
the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a 
working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be 
distributed to you a week prior to the class.  

I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per 
student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please 
RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a 
count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.",Abusive

A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really
well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in
passionate love making.

The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, ""quick my husbandjust got
home, go hide in the bathroom!"" So the man runs into the bathroom.

Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. ""Why are you
naked?"" he asks.

Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here
and get ready to recieve you.""

""Okay."" the man replies ""I'll go get ready.""

He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a
naked man standing there clapping his hands.

""Who the fuck are you?"" the man asks

""I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid
of the moths you are having problems with.""

The husband exclaims, ""But you are naked!""

The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.

How are things going?  You still pursuing JD's girl?  How's Corey doing?
Did you ever move into the bigger one-bedrooms at Bayou Park?  I hope so --
those studio apartments are too small.  How's Ingrid? doing?

As for myself, I have never been so busy in my life -- papers, group
projects, tests, etc.  I rarely have time to go out, and that really sucks
because the undergraduate women around here are just spectacular.  Granted,
they tend to be a bit bitchy (being rich daddy's girls and all), but they're
very easy on the eyes.  Anyway, if the trend continues, I doubt if I'll be
getting laid much during my two years at Vandy -- too many damn papers to
write!

Let me know how things are going.  I just got an e-mail from Jim; I think
I'll just be starting module 2 around Nov. 4, so I'll see if I can make it
down there.

A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really
well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in
passionate love making.

The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, ""quick my husbandjust got
home, go hide in the bathroom!"" So the man runs into the bathroom.

Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. ""Why are you
naked?"" he asks.

Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here
and get ready to recieve you.""

""Okay."" the man replies ""I'll go get ready.""

He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a
naked man standing there clapping his hands.

""Who the fuck are you?"" the man asks

""I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid
of the moths you are having problems with.""

The husband exclaims, ""But you are naked!""

The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.

One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway. It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.

He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.

With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!

Now, the Moral of the Story:
Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.  Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!

Remember the five simple rules to be happy:
1. Free your heart from hatred.
2. Free your mind from worries.
3. Live simply.
4. Give more.
5. Expect less.

They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, ""This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair.""

A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really
well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in
passionate love making.

The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, ""quick my husbandjust got
home, go hide in the bathroom!"" So the man runs into the bathroom.

Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. ""Why are you
naked?"" he asks.

Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here
and get ready to recieve you.""

""Okay."" the man replies ""I'll go get ready.""

He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a
naked man standing there clapping his hands.

""Who the fuck are you?"" the man asks

""I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid
of the moths you are having problems with.""

The husband exclaims, ""But you are naked!""

The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.

""Those little bastards!""

Subject:	ERCOT Zonal Load Forecasts

Starting tomorrow (8/15), I will start publishing a load forecast for the North, West, and South zones in ERCOT.  The zonal forecasts will be run at the same time that the total ERCOT load forecast is being run.  I want to communicate how the zonal forecasts are being generated and the limitations of the zonal forecasts.

The zonal load forecasts are being generated using data from the ten old control areas.  I generate a load forecast for each of the old control areas and then portion out the loads in the appropriate amounts to each of the zones.  The reason I am generating a load forecast for each of the old control areas is for future use in the PowerWorld model.  I have load data through 12/31/2000 for each of these areas.  Each of the models is estimated from 7/1/1998 through 12/31/2000.  Since ERCOT is not publishing actual zonal loads at this time (let me know if that assumption is not correct), we are currently lagging nearly eight months of data and, obviously, this gap will continue to grow.  For these reasons, as well as the ones you are already aware of, East Power's forecasts of ERCOT's zonal loads could differ from the ISO's forecasts.

The zonal load forecasts are in the following location:

m:\electric\metrixnd\daily forecasts\first forecast\ERCOT Regional Load.xls (with tabs for each of the regions)


I will continue to publish a separate total ERCOT load forecast, the model of which is estimated from 1/1/1999 through 8/13/2001 (always containing the most current load data available).  The total ERCOT load forecast will differ from the sum of the zonal load forecasts due to the different estimation periods and the use of separate models.  A comparison between the ERCOT total load forecast and the sum of the zonal load forecasts shows that they are reasonably close.  You are welcome to do your own comparisons.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.",Abusive

If Santa answered his mail honestly... 
Dear Santa, 
I wud like a kool toy space  ranjur fer Xmas. Iv ben a gud boy all 
yeer yer  Frend, 
BiLLy 
Dear Billy, 
Nice spelling. You're on  your way to a great career in lawn care. 
How about I  send you a frickin book so you can learn to read and 
write? 
I'm giving your older brother the space  ranger. At least HE can 
spell! 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I have been a good girl all  year, and the only thing I ask for is 
peace and joy in  the world for everybody! 
Love, Sarah 
Dear Sarah, 
Your parents were smoking  pot when they had you, didn't they? 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I don't know if you can do  this, but for Christmas, I'd like for 
my mommy and daddy  to get back together. Please see what you 
can do?  
Love Teddy 
Dear Teddy, 
Look, your dad's banging the  babysitter like a screen door in a 
hurricane. Do you  think he's gonna give that up to come back to 
your  frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly? It's time to give 
up that dream. Let me get you some nice Legos instead. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I want a new bike, a  Playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, 
a drum kit,  a pony and a tuba. 
Love, Francis 
Dear Francis, 
Who names their kid  ""Francis"" nowadays? I bet you're gay.  Only 
gay  people want tubas.  I'll set you up with a nice Barbie. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I left milk and cookies for  you under the tree, and I left 
carrots for your reindeer  outside the back door. 
Love, Susan 
Dear Susan, 
Milk gives me the runs and  carrots make the deer fart in my face 
when riding in the  sleigh.  You want to do me a favor?  Leave me 
a bottle of scotch. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
What do you do the other 364  days of the year? Are you busy 
making toys?  
Your friend, 
Thomas 
Dear Thomas, 
All the toys are made in  China. I have a condo in Vegas, where I 
spend most of my  time making low-budget porno films.  These 
producers seem to like fat studs. I unwind by drinking myself  
silly and squeezing the asses of all the cocktail  waitresses 
while losing money at the craps table.  
Hey, you wanted to know. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
Do you see us when we're  sleeping, do you really know when 
we're awake, like in  the song? 
Love, Jessica 
Dear Jessica, 
Are you really that  gullible?  I'll bet you're blonde.  Good luck 
in whatever you do.  I'm skipping your house. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I really really want a puppy  this year. Please please please 
PLEASE PLEASE could I  have one? 
Timmy 
Timmy, 
That whiney, begging shit may  work with your folks, but that 
crap doesn't work with  me. You're getting a sweater again. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dearest Santa, 
We don't have a chimney  in our house, how do you get into our 
home?  
Love, Marky 
Mark, 
First, stop calling yourself  ""Marky"", it sounds gay. That's why 
you're getting your  ass whipped at school.  Second, you don't 
live in a  house, you live in a low-rent apartment complex. 
Third,  I get inside your pad just like your mother's boyfriend 
does, thru the bedroom window. 
Sweet  Dreams,

If Santa answered his mail honestly... 
Dear Santa, 
I wud like a kool toy space  ranjur fer Xmas. Iv ben a gud boy all 
yeer yer  Frend, 
BiLLy 
Dear Billy, 
Nice spelling. You're on  your way to a great career in lawn care. 
How about I  send you a frickin book so you can learn to read and 
write? 
I'm giving your older brother the space  ranger. At least HE can 
spell! 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I have been a good girl all  year, and the only thing I ask for is 
peace and joy in  the world for everybody! 
Love, Sarah 
Dear Sarah, 
Your parents were smoking  pot when they had you, didn't they? 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I don't know if you can do  this, but for Christmas, I'd like for 
my mommy and daddy  to get back together. Please see what you 
can do?  
Love Teddy 
Dear Teddy, 
Look, your dad's banging the  babysitter like a screen door in a 
hurricane. Do you  think he's gonna give that up to come back to 
your  frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly? It's time to give 
up that dream. Let me get you some nice Legos instead. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I want a new bike, a  Playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, 
a drum kit,  a pony and a tuba. 
Love, Francis 
Dear Francis, 
Who names their kid  ""Francis"" nowadays? I bet you're gay.  Only 
gay  people want tubas.  I'll set you up with a nice Barbie. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I left milk and cookies for  you under the tree, and I left 
carrots for your reindeer  outside the back door. 
Love, Susan 
Dear Susan, 
Milk gives me the runs and  carrots make the deer fart in my face 
when riding in the  sleigh.  You want to do me a favor?  Leave me 
a bottle of scotch. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
What do you do the other 364  days of the year? Are you busy 
making toys?  
Your friend, 
Thomas 
Dear Thomas, 
All the toys are made in  China. I have a condo in Vegas, where I 
spend most of my  time making low-budget porno films.  These 
producers seem to like fat studs. I unwind by drinking myself  
silly and squeezing the asses of all the cocktail  waitresses 
while losing money at the craps table.  
Hey, you wanted to know. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
Do you see us when we're  sleeping, do you really know when 
we're awake, like in  the song? 
Love, Jessica 
Dear Jessica, 
Are you really that  gullible?  I'll bet you're blonde.  Good luck 
in whatever you do.  I'm skipping your house. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I really really want a puppy  this year. Please please please 
PLEASE PLEASE could I  have one? 
Timmy 
Timmy, 
That whiney, begging shit may  work with your folks, but that 
crap doesn't work with  me. You're getting a sweater again. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dearest Santa, 
We don't have a chimney  in our house, how do you get into our 
home?  
Love, Marky 
Mark, 
First, stop calling yourself  ""Marky"", it sounds gay. That's why 
you're getting your  ass whipped at school.  Second, you don't 
live in a  house, you live in a low-rent apartment complex. 
Third,  I get inside your pad just like your mother's boyfriend 
does, thru the bedroom window. 
Sweet  Dreams,

And God populated the earth with broccoli  and cauliflower and spinach, 
 green and yellow vegetables of all  kinds, so Man and Woman would live 
 long and healthy lives.  
 
 And Satan created McDonald's. And  McDonald's brought forth the 
 99-cent double-cheeseburger. And  Satan said to Man, ""You want fries 
 with that?"" And Man said, ""Super  size them."" And Man gained pounds. 
 
 And God created the healthful  yogurt, that woman might keep her figure 
 that man found so fair.  
 
 And Satan froze the yogurt, and he  brought forth chocolate, nuts and 
 brightly colored sprinkle candy to  put on the yogurt. And woman 
 gained pounds. 
 
 And God said, ""Try my crispy fresh  salad."" 
 
 And Satan brought forth creamy  dressings, bacon bits, and shredded 
cheese. And there was ice cream for  dessert. And woman gained 
 pounds. 
 
And God said, ""I have sent your heart  healthy vegetables and olive oil 
with which to cook them."" 
 
 And Satan brought forth  chicken-fried steak so big it needed its own 
 platter. And Man gained pounds, and  his bad cholesterol went 
through the roof. 
 
 And God brought forth running  shoes, and Man resolved to lose those 
 extra pounds. 
 
 And Satan brought forth cable TV  with remote control so Man would not 
 have to toil to change channels  between ESPN and ESPN2. And Man 
 gained pounds. 
 
 And God said, ""You're running up  the score, Devil."" 
 
 And God brought forth the potato, a  vegetable naturally low in fat and 
 brimming with nutrition.  
 
 And Satan peeled off the healthful  skin and sliced the starchy center 
 into chips and deep-fat fried them.  And he created sour cream dip 
 also. And Man clutched his remote  control and ate the potato chips 
 swaddled in cholesterol. And Satan  saw and said, ""It is good."" And 
 Man went into cardiac arrest.

Dear  Santa,
I've written you for three years now asking for a fire truck.  
Please, I really really want a fire truck this year! 
Love,  Joey
Dear Joey,
Let me make it up to you. Christmas Eve, while you  sleep, I'm 
gonna torch your house.  You'll have more fire trucks than  you'll 
know what to do with.

Dear Santa,
I  don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas, I'd like for 
my mommy and  daddy to get back together. Please see what you can 
do.

Dear Teddy,
What, and ruin that hot affair your dad's still  having with the

Dear Santa,
I left milk and cookies for you under the tree,  and I left carrots
or your reindeer outside the backdoor.

You want to be a kiss-ass? Leave me a glass of Chivas Regal  and 
some Toblerone.

What do you do the other 364 days of the  year? Are you making toys?
Your friend, Thomas

Firstly, stop calling yourself ""Marky"";  that's why you're getting

That is pretty funny.   You know what is funny about that is that I was 
pretty sure she would call and tell you that.  What a dork! You know what, I 
am starting to get sick too and it sucks because Burnsy is coming into town 
this weekend.   Anyway hopefully I will get better.  
Well, my good streak came to an end after a whopping one week when I found 
out that my grandma is in a comma and will only live another day or two and 
my dad is in the hospital again with a blod clot in his heart and will be 
there a week and maybe longer..  It is really hard to be sitting up here and 
not be with my family right now but I think and hope they understand. And I 
will be going down there next weekend to visit and apparently for my 
grandmothers funeral.  My mom is not doing well at all and I really wish I 
could be there for her.  She doesn't deal with loss very well.  
On a positive note it looks like i will probably start trading real time 
energy in the next few weeks. I am moving to that department and I am sooooo 
excited about it.  The only thing that sucks is that it is a lot like fire 
fighter hours in that you have to work night shifts.  It works three days on 
then three days off, three nights on three days off and then once a month you 
get six days in a row off.  So in a month you get a ton more days off but, 
you have to work some nights and some weekends which sucks.  That part will 
be sweet but I am not too excited about working the 6pm to 6am shift.  But it 
also entails a raise of $4500 due to the hours so all in all it should be a 
positive move.  Anyway how is everything with you?",Abusive

David got home tonight and told me the fun you guys had in Seattle.? The snow 
shoe hike sounded like a good work out and fun too, but I'm sure I wouldn't 
have made it as smoothly as the rest of you.? I'm so fucking fat and I'm 
determined to get back in the shape that I should be and the way I was most 
of my life!? I've got to start working out on a consistent basis.? David said 
that if I don't the family is going to have a FAT intervention on me!!!

By the way, a note about Cita.? I can't even begin to tell you how much she 
loves you and since Bill left us she's even looking at you as a spiritual 
replacement of him.? Now I'm not saying that she doesn't love Angela as much, 
but Cita has a bond with the boys in our family (Kevin, Donald, Steve) in a 
totally different way as she does with the girls!!? I can't explain why (I've 
got my theories) but she just does.? 

Anyway, I was visiting her on Monday and she was really distraught about the 
last conversation she had with you over the phone while you were at Jorge's 
house.? She said that she felt that you misunderstood what she meant when she 
said that Bill was stupid.? I'm sure you know what she meant by it as far as 
him not wanting to change his life style (drinking & smoking), but she felt 
that you got mad at her for calling him stupid.? Her biggest consern is that 
she feels for that reason you probably won't want to talk to her again or 
much at all!!? I did tell her that you are a dick but that you're not that 
big of a dick!!? Regardless, we all know that you're a?prick anyway, but 
could you please give her a call sometime soon just to put her mind at ease?? 
You don't have to mention the ""stupid"" word or conversation, just call her to 
say hi and that you miss her more than she misses you!? Don't tell her that I 
emailed you about! my conversation with her.? Otherwise she'll just say ""what 
the fuck is an email?""

Looking forward to seeing you later this month.(the 23rd)? Also, I want you 
to know that you're really not a prick, your a dickhead!

As always - with way more love than you deserve,? Uncle (fat) Bobby!!!

services.  In LA to get someone for that cheap is really a bargain.  You have 
got to realize it s really expensive to live there.  Especially if your 
office is in Beverly Hills.  You kind of have two options.  You could live in 
the Valley for cheaper.  But in my opinion the Valley sucks. I would never 
ever ever live in the valley.   Or you could find somewhere in like North 
Hollywood or maybe Redondo Beach.  Lisa lives there (north Hollywood)  and 
pays about $900 a month for a one bedroom apartment.  Which is very

new territory this year and you all could be the first to harvest a nice big
bull.  I'll probably head over on wednesday or thursday night and hunt
through the weekend.  Hsu, no sidehill walking this year, unless there's a
bucket of rice over there.  Guzman, you missed it last year so I'm counting
on you to be the first elk hunter in history to walk around in a big-ass
sombrero with a side-shooter and a bottle of mezcal. Marcus, I don't give a

was actually very sick but ended up going out and doing stuff anyway since 
Burns was in town I just didn't drink.  On Friday night a bunch of us met up 
with Burns at Silver Dollar Pizza.  We hung out there for a while and then 
went to the Gypsy.  I came home rather early since I wasn't drinking and 
didn't want to stay in the smokey Gypsy when i was sick.  Then on Saturday 
Valarie, Boyd and I drove down to the Beavers game. We had the best time.  We 
went to the peacock first and the  tailgated before the game.  Burnsy, Sul, 
Shef, Chris and Jimmy were so retarded by gametime.  I felt like a big 
babysitter being the only sober one.  The game was awesome and everyone but 
me valarie and boyd stayed down in Corvallis.  Sunday I was still feeling 
sick but went to breakfast and shopping with Cheryl and then we justed vegged 
at her house, watched some football, then went to the movies.  For being sick 
and not touching a drop of alcohol all weekend I remarkebly had a great 
time.  I still don't feel very well and had to go to the doctor yesterday 
becuase I started having some bad asthma.  T  Everything else is going okay I 
guess.  I have my final interview for that position I want on Thursday and 
then on Friday I leave for LA .  So anyway, hope your week is going a little 
better than your weekend went. Doesn't sound like you had much fun.  Were you 
and Dave in a fight because he flaked on you or was it something else? ",Abusive

Actually that doesnt sound very funny to me.  I mean what the fuck did he do 
that for? What was he so mad about? I can imagine that you would be scared 
seeing him act like that.  Hopefully he doesn't ever act like that or show 
that kind of temper around you.  Anyway its really none of my business i 
guess.  I appreciate the sentiment about my family and I will mention it to 
my mother.  I hope you feel better.

That is pretty funny.   You know what is funny about that is that I was 
pretty sure she would call and tell you that.  What a dork! You know what, I 
am starting to get sick too and it sucks because Burnsy is coming into town 
this weekend.   Anyway hopefully I will get better.  
Well, my good streak came to an end after a whopping one week when I found 
out that my grandma is in a comma and will only live another day or two and 
my dad is in the hospital again with a blod clot in his heart and will be 
there a week and maybe longer..  It is really hard to be sitting up here and 
not be with my family right now but I think and hope they understand. And I 
will be going down there next weekend to visit and apparently for my 
grandmothers funeral.  My mom is not doing well at all and I really wish I 
could be there for her.  She doesn't deal with loss very well.  
On a positive note it looks like i will probably start trading real time 
energy in the next few weeks. I am moving to that department and I am sooooo 
excited about it.  The only thing that sucks is that it is a lot like fire 
fighter hours in that you have to work night shifts.  It works three days on 
then three days off, three nights on three days off and then once a month you 
get six days in a row off.  So in a month you get a ton more days off but, 
you have to work some nights and some weekends which sucks.  That part will 
be sweet but I am not too excited about working the 6pm to 6am shift.  But it 
also entails a raise of $4500 due to the hours so all in all it should be a 
positive move.  Anyway how is everything with you?",Abusive

            Sometimes I wish I was a woman, because I
            bet ""The Woman With Testicles"" could make
             a lot of money on the sideshow circuit.

                           (Fred Meyer)

                      Rumination of the Day

            Sometimes I wish I was a woman, because I
            bet ""The Woman With Testicles"" could make
             a lot of money on the sideshow circuit.

going in the city by the bay.  Got your address from Sul at Monday nights 
softball game.  Which we won.  We haven't lost in this section of the fall 
league and are playing really good ball.  Maybe it is our upgrade at first 
base.  So I am still not sure if I will be able to come down for the Cal game 
or not. Right now I am kind of broke from all the flights to LA.  I went and 
had a few beers with Cheryl last night.  She called me up about 8:00 and I 
was bored so I decided to go with her.  She got so fucking ass faced.  Man 
that chick is a train wreck sometimes.  So how is school?  What kind of

you are to close with them to actually move.  I wish you luck and hopefully 
you get a good offer but i would definetly think about needing more than just 
$35,000 to live in LA. I would think the absolute minimum you should take 
would be $40,000 to $45,000 plus moving costs and siging bonus.  He has been 
persuing you for over a year so it appears he is pretty desperate for you 
services.  In LA to get someone for that cheap is really a bargain.  You have 
got to realize it s really expensive to live there.  Especially if your 
office is in Beverly Hills.  You kind of have two options.  You could live in 
the Valley for cheaper.  But in my opinion the Valley sucks. I would never 
ever ever live in the valley.   Or you could find somewhere in like North 
Hollywood or maybe Redondo Beach.  Lisa lives there (north Hollywood)  and 
pays about $900 a month for a one bedroom apartment.  Which is very 
reasonable for LA.  Maybe Danny has some connections.   So I am curious, if 
Dave was to say I love you and don't go would you stay?",Abusive

David got home tonight and told me the fun you guys had in Seattle.? The snow 
shoe hike sounded like a good work out and fun too, but I'm sure I wouldn't 
have made it as smoothly as the rest of you.? I'm so fucking fat and I'm 
determined to get back in the shape that I should be and the way I was most 
of my life!? I've got to start working out on a consistent basis.? David said 
that if I don't the family is going to have a FAT intervention on me!!!

By the way, a note about Cita.? I can't even begin to tell you how much she 
loves you and since Bill left us she's even looking at you as a spiritual 
replacement of him.? Now I'm not saying that she doesn't love Angela as much, 
but Cita has a bond with the boys in our family (Kevin, Donald, Steve) in a 
totally different way as she does with the girls!!? I can't explain why (I've 
got my theories) but she just does.? 

Anyway, I was visiting her on Monday and she was really distraught about the 
last conversation she had with you over the phone while you were at Jorge's 
house.? She said that she felt that you misunderstood what she meant when she 
said that Bill was stupid.? I'm sure you know what she meant by it as far as 
him not wanting to change his life style (drinking & smoking), but she felt 
that you got mad at her for calling him stupid.? Her biggest consern is that 
she feels for that reason you probably won't want to talk to her again or 
much at all!!? I did tell her that you are a dick but that you're not that 
big of a dick!!? Regardless, we all know that you're a?prick anyway, but 
could you please give her a call sometime soon just to put her mind at ease?? 
You don't have to mention the ""stupid"" word or conversation, just call her to 
say hi and that you miss her more than she misses you!? Don't tell her that I 
emailed you about! my conversation with her.? Otherwise she'll just say ""what 
the fuck is an email?""

Looking forward to seeing you later this month.(the 23rd)? Also, I want you 
to know that you're really not a prick, your a dickhead!

As always - with way more love than you deserve,? Uncle (fat) Bobby!!!

Never mind.  So anyway, I am totally worked right now.  I went to the
Blazer game with my friend Kate and we ended up going out afterward.  i
ended up staying out until 2am and I had to be in to work at 5:30.  So
basically my day is totally sucking.  How are you doing?",Abusive
1112,guzman-m/notes_inbox/1257.,<29491941.1075840724034.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Hi Mark,

David got home tonight and told me the fun you guys had in Seattle.? The snow 
shoe hike sounded like a good work out and fun too, but I'm sure I wouldn't 
have made it as smoothly as the rest of you.? I'm so fucking fat and I'm 
determined to get back in the shape that I should be and the way I was most 
of my life!? I've got to start working out on a consistent basis.? David said 
that if I don't the family is going to have a FAT intervention on me!!!

By the way, a note about Cita.? I can't even begin to tell you how much she 
loves you and since Bill left us she's even looking at you as a spiritual 
replacement of him.? Now I'm not saying that she doesn't love Angela as much, 
but Cita has a bond with the boys in our family (Kevin, Donald, Steve) in a 
totally different way as she does with the girls!!? I can't explain why (I've 
got my theories) but she just does.? 

Anyway, I was visiting her on Monday and she was really distraught about the 
last conversation she had with you over the phone while you were at Jorge's 
house.? She said that she felt that you misunderstood what she meant when she 
said that Bill was stupid.? I'm sure you know what she meant by it as far as 
him not wanting to change his life style (drinking & smoking), but she felt 
that you got mad at her for calling him stupid.? Her biggest consern is that 
she feels for that reason you probably won't want to talk to her again or 
much at all!!? I did tell her that you are a dick but that you're not that 
big of a dick!!? Regardless, we all know that you're a?prick anyway, but 
could you please give her a call sometime soon just to put her mind at ease?? 
You don't have to mention the ""stupid"" word or conversation, just call her to 
say hi and that you miss her more than she misses you!? Don't tell her that I 
emailed you about! my conversation with her.? Otherwise she'll just say ""what 
the fuck is an email?""

Looking forward to seeing you later this month.(the 23rd)? Also, I want you 
to know that you're really not a prick, your a dickhead!

As always - with way more love than you deserve,? Uncle (fat) Bobby!!!

            Sometimes I wish I was a woman, because I
            bet ""The Woman With Testicles"" could make
             a lot of money on the sideshow circuit.

                           (Fred Meyer)

Subject: This is actually tough  to read



If you decide not to forward this, please send it back to me. I  know this is
too true and so dreadful. Oprah actually had a show about this  atrocity.
This is an actual petition, and ""signatures"" will be lost if you  drop the
line. Please take 3 minutes out of your life to do your  part.
Madhu, the government of Afghanistan, is waging a war upon women. Since  the
Taliban took power in 1996, women have had to wear burqua and have  been
beaten and stoned in public for not having the proper attire, even if  this
means simply not having the mesh covering in front of their eyes.
One  woman was beaten to death by an angry mob of fundamentalists for
accidentally  exposing her arm(!) while she was driving. Another was stoned
to death for  trying to leave the country with a man that was not a relative.
Women are not  allowed to work or even go out in public without a male
relative;  professional women such as professors, translators, doctors,
lawyers, artists  and writers have been forced from their jobs and restricted
to their homes.  Homes where a woman is present must have their windows
painted so that she  can never be seen by outsiders.
They must wear silent shoes so that they are  never heard. Women live in fear
of their lives for the slightest misbehavior.  Because they cannot work,
those without male relatives or husbands are either  starving to death or
begging the street, even if they hold Ph.D.s. Depression  is becoming so
widespread that it has reached emergency levels. There is no  way in such an
extreme Islamic society to know the suicide rate with  certainty, but relief
workers are estimating that the suicide rate among  women must be
extraordinarily high: those who cannot find proper medication  and treatment
for severe depression and would rather take their lives than  live in such
conditions.
At one of the rare hospitals for women, a  reporter found still, nearly
lifeless bodies lying motionless on top of beds,  wrapped in their bur qua,
unwilling to speak, eat, or do anything, but slowly  wasting away. Others
have gone mad and were seen crouched in corners,  perpetually rocking or
crying, most of them in fear. When what little  medication that is left
finally runs out, one doctor is considering leaving  these women in front of
the president's residence as a form of protest. It is  at the point where the
term ""human rights violations"" has become an  understatement.
Husbands have the power of life and death over their women  relatives,
especially their wives, but an angry mob has just as much right to  stone or
beat a woman, often to death, for exposing an inch of flesh or  offending
them in the slightest way.
Women enjoyed relative freedom: to  work, to dress generally as they wanted,
and to drive and appear in public  alone until only 1996. The rapidity of
this transition is the main reason for  the depression and suicide; Women who
were once educators or doctors or  simply used to basic human freedoms are
now severely restricted and treated  as subhuman in the name of right-wing
fundamentalist Islam. It is not their  tradition or 'culture,' but it is
alien to them, and it is extreme even for  those cultures where
fundamentalism is the rule.
Everyone has a right to a  tolerable human existence, even if they are women
in a Muslim country. If we  can threaten military force in Kosovo the name of
human rights for the sake  of ethnic Albanians, citizens of the world can
certainly express peaceful  outrage at the oppression, murder and injustice
committed against women by  the Taliban.
STATEMENT: In signing this, we agree that the current treatment  of women in
Afghanistan is completely UNACCEPTABLE and deserves action by the  United
Nations and that the current situation overseas will not be  tolerated.
Women's Rights is not a small issue anywhere, and it is  UNACCEPTABLE for
women in 2000 to be treated as subhuman and as so much  property. Equality
and human decency is a fundamental RIGHT, not a freedom to  be granted,
whether one lives in Afghanistan or elsewhere.

  I am working this noon time on your orders.  I received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet and it is half of what you were quoted.  Both are in stock.  The purchase price will be a little more because of freight.  Also, my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate.  I am checking with him and will let you know.  Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders?

  I have filled out the application for Robert Allen, but need to get banking information from my husband before I can send it in.  My goal is to have it done by Friday.  It's just been very busy here!  Sorry for the delay!

The old priest asked the new priest to sit in on his sessions. The new

confessions,
then the old priest asks him to step out of the confessional for a few
suggestions.
The old priest suggests, ""Cross you arms over your chest and rub your
chin with one hand."" The new priest tries this. The old priest suggests,
""Try saying things like, 'I see', 'yes', 'go on', 'I understand', and 'how
did
you feel about that?'""
The new priest says those things, trying them out.

the building's fault...Armin and Lolo worked all evening installing the 
largest
of our 3 garage doors on the warehouse.  It's a really tall and wide door, so
that large trucks can pull all the way into the warehouse to unload.  Well, 
all
went well with the installation, and it was time for them to go.   Lolo closed
and locked the garage door while Armin loaded up his work truck to leave.
When Armin slammed the sliding side door shut, he somehow forgot to let go
with his left hand...so the door slammed shut with his fingers in it.  That's
not the worst, Armin had locked the door before he slammed it shut!  It was
locked with his fingers smashed inside!!!  That's STILL not the worst!  He had
already cranked the truck, so the keys were in the ignition on the oposite 
side
of the truck from where he was trapped!!!!

Thank GOD LOLO HADN'T LEFT YET!!! He got the keys and unlocked the door, 
freeing
Armin's smashed 3 middle fingers.  If he would've been alone there, as he
normally is late at night, it would've been terrible!!!

So he came home around 10:30 PM in shock with pain.  He took aspirin and was
finally able to sleep about 1 AM.  This morning he could move them, but they 
are
swollen and purple and very painful.  Of course, he won't go to the doctor, He
says that they aren't broken ? ? ? But he is in a lot of pain.  He must have
been terribly tired to do something so stupid.  He needs to take a break, but 
he
won't...hopefully when Melissa and family get here he will slow down.

Hope you all are having a safe week!

Lesson Number One

A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day.
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, ""Can I also sit like you and

do nothing all day long?
The crow answered: ""Sure, why not."" So, the rabbit sat on the ground
! below the crow, and rested. All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on
the
rabbit and ate it.

Management Lesson: To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting

very, very high up.

Lesson Number Two

A turkey was chatting with a bull. ""I would love to be able to get to
the top of that tree,"" sighed the turkey, ""but I haven't got the energy.
""Well,
why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?"" replied the bull.
""They're
packed with nutrients."" The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found
that it
actually gave him enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree.

The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.

Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of
the tree.
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the

tree.

Management Lesson: Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep

you there.! 

Lesson Number Three

When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to
be Boss. The Brain said, ""I should be Boss because I control the whole
body's responses and functions."" The feet said, ""We should be Boss as
we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go."" The
hands
said, ""We should be the Boss because we do all the work and earn all the

money.""
And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes until
finally the asshole spoke up. All the parts laughed at the idea of the
asshole
being the Boss. So the asshole went on strike, blocked itself up and
refused to work. Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands

clenched, the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the
brain fevered. Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be
the
Boss, so the motion was passed. All the other parts did all the work
while the
Boss just sat and passed out th! e shit!

Management Lesson: You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole
will do.

Lesson Number Four

A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold, the Bird
froze and fell to the ground in a large field. While it was lying there,

a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. As the frozen bird lay there
in
the pile of cow dung, it began to realize how warm it was. The dung was
actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon
began to sing
for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate.
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow
dung, and
promptly dug him out and ate him!

Management Lessons:

1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy.
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut.

1. Any Man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally  
killed and eaten by his fellow partygoers.  
  
2. Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.  
  
3. It is ok for a man to cry under the following circumstances:  
a. When a heroic dog dies to save its master  
b. The moment Angelina Jolie starts unbuttoning her blouse  
c. After wrecking your boss' Ferrari  
d. One hour, 12 minutes, 37 seconds into The Crying Game  
e. When your Date is using her teeth  
  
4. Unless he murdered someone in your family, you must bail a  
friend out of jail within 12 hours.  
  
5. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend move  
a. Your legs have been severed in a freak threshing accident  
  
6. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend of a friend move:  
a. You'd rather stay home and watch speed buggy reruns  
  
7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is  off  
limits forever, unless you actually marry her.  
  
8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy who's  running  
late is 5 minutes. Maximum waiting time: 6 minutes. For a girl,  you have  
to wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the  classic  
1-10 scale.  
  
9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's fridge is  
forbidden. Gripe at will if the temperature is unsuitable.  
  
10. No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for  another  
man. (In fact, even remembering your buddy's birthday is strictly  
optional.)  
  
11. On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops,  not the  
weakest.  
  
12. While your girlfriend must bond with your buddies'  girlfriends  
within 30 minutes of meeting them, you are not required to make  nice  
with her gal pals' significant dick-heads--- low level sports  
bonding is all the law requires (sorry ladies, it's called a  double  
standard because it's twice as true).  
  
13. Unless you have signed a lucrative endorsement contract, do  not  
appear in public wearing more than one swoosh.  
  
14. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you  may  
always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never  ask  
who's playing.  
  
15. You may flatulate in front of a woman only after you have  brought  
her to climax. If you trap her head under the covers for the  purpose of  
flatulent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend.  
  
16. Only in situations of Moral and/or Ass peril are you allowed  to  
kick another guy in the nuts.  
  
18. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.  
  
19. Friends don't let friends wear Speedos. Ever. Issue closed.  
  
20. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem---you didn't  see  
nothin'.  
  
21. Women who claim they ""love to watch sports"" must be treated  as  
spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the  ability to  
pick a buffalo wing clean (chicken wing).  
  
22. You must offer heartfelt and public condolences over the  death of a  
girlfriend's cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire  
and threw it into a ceiling fan.  
  
23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman  must  
remain sober enough to fight.  
  
24. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice  of  
pizza, but not both. That's just plain mean.  
  
25. If you complement a guy on his six-pack, you'd better be  talking  
about his choice of beer.  
  
26. Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a buddy of  yours,  
except if she's withholding sex pending your response.  
  
27. Phrases that may not be uttered to another man while lifting  
weights:  
a. Yeah, Baby, Push it!  
b. C'mon, give me one more! Harder!  
c. Another set and we can hit the showers!  
d. Nice Ass, Are you a Sagittarius?  
  
28. Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal  footing:  
both urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other  situations, an  
almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need.  
  
29. Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than  you  
are able to have sex with her. Keep a stopwatch by the phone;  Hang  
up if necessary.  
  
30. When a buddy is trying to hook you up, you may sabotage him  only in  
a manner that gives you no chance of getting laid either.  
  
31. You cannot rat out a coworker who shows up at work with a  massive  
hangover. You may however, hide the aspirin, smear his chair with  
limburger cheese, turn the brightness dial all the way down so he  
thinks his monitor is broken, and have him paged over the  
loudspeaker every seven minutes.  
  
32. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly ""just a  friend""  
have carnal drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling  weird and  
guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion  about  
what a big mistake it was.  
  
33. Always split aces and eights. No arguments.  ",Abusive

1) They won't shut up. They have to go on about spirit, and old army, and r=
ed ass, and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their=
 urine to beat UT, and blah blah blah. Shut up. You start to get the feelin=
g the entire school was built to spite UT.=20
2) Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the 1870's passe=
d legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsi=
diary branch of the main school (University of Texas) that would teach agri=
culture and mechanics. Aggies love to say their school is older, from where=
 they get that I don't now......the fact is, the State intended A&M to be a=
 branch of UT. They are like the afterbirth from the original creation. Lik=
e Danny Devito in ""Twins"".=20
3) So they apparently have this complex, so much so, that they must devote =
their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good. Al=
l the while, nobody at UT denies that A&M is a good school, yet they won't =
shut up. So they write a fight song......about?....Texas, and how they want=
 to beat them. They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell them how =
bad Texas is and how good A&M and all its traditions are. It is the world's=
 largest known case of penis envy, and it is manifested in everything A&M d=
oes.=20
4) The people at A&M. Now we all have friends who went to A&M or are at A&M=
. There are some nice people there. However...there is the Corp. East Texas=
' answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere. For every boy scout who never l=
earned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys, there is the Corp. Now, forget=
 the fact that A&M will actually let people with sub-par grades enroll if t=
hey agree to join the Corp. Forget the fact that the Corps looked like a Ge=
stapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field in 1995. Forget =
the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed a=
gainst them, and swept under the rug over the years, they just this past mo=
nth have had one Corps member bring charges against another Corps member wh=
o apparently had been propositioning others for a little actual sodomy. Not=
 only could I go on with more instances of idiocracy by these Khaki-clad-sh=
aven-headed-dorks, I am sure each of you have your own stories. The point i=
s: We all respect West Point, Annapolis, The Air Force Academy; however, no=
body respects the Corp. I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of th=
e military world. Just because you dress like the Army, and try and act lik=
e the Army, does not make you the Army. People at A&M don't even respect th=
ese clowns. It is not cool to shave your head and dress up. Halloween is on=
ly supposed to be one day of the year. If you want to carry guns and beat u=
p civilians, move to Israel.=20
5) It is even less cool to slobber on somebody's daughter on national telev=
ision and call it a tradition. Dry humping 18 year old girls in the stands =
at football games is not cool. Not only is it not cool, it should be agains=
t the law. I know that in College Station, students are just prone to mount=
 each other on the campus lawn, or in the middle of class, or anytime anyth=
ing good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start s=
ucking on her face. But everywhere else in the world, it is looked down upo=
n. Especially if you are doing it on my TV. That is why we have moved the g=
ame from Thanksgiving. Because people across the nation were gagging on the=
ir turkey when in the middle of watching a football game, some boy scout is=
 tongue thrashing some overweight co-ed during somebody's Thanksgiving dinn=
er. We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your=
 woeful offense manages to put points on the board. Some of these girls are=
 in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter. Screw that, forget ma=
ke-up, it is too late for that, just give them a veil.=20
6) ""t.u."" is not funny. It is NOT insulting. It is dumb. Just imagine if fo=
lks from Texas kept talking about M&A and giggling. That would not be funny=
. In fact, it would be retarded. That's why UT fans don't do it. Please lea=
rn.=20
7) You want to lose the image of country bumpkins, of a people fond of shee=
p, of people that aren't stupid? Then quit building things that fall down. =
Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV. Quit whooping =
in church. Quit whooping period. Quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoym=
ent of dead mammals. Quit spending your Friday nights practicing how to yel=
l. Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you're running for Governor. W=
hen you are filling out season ticket renewals, and the form asks for your =
phone #, H & W, quit putting 258-3999, Height 6'3"", Weight 185. Just, colle=
ctively, stop making asses of yourselves. Go to East Texas, tour every smal=
l town, and ask every red neck with a 5th grade education why they cheer fo=
r A&M and wear maroon. That is your fan base. This is why you are perceived=
 by the educated masses as stupid.=20
8) Nobody cares if you think your band is better. They might be louder, the=
y might march in neat little zig zags, but they have no musical ability. Th=
e point is, nobody cares who wins halftime. Quit getting geeked up about ma=
rching bands. I find it hard to believe you stood through your high school =
band's entire halftime performance. And why? Cause nobody cared then and no=
body cares now. Plus, you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do ca=
re. Why is it cool all of a sudden now that you're in college?=20
9) Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds. Perhaps the only =
justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an a=
nal probe. Oh wait...I understand now.=20
10) Dogs are not ladies. They don't look or smell like ladies. Dogs eat the=
ir own feces and should be treated accordingly.=20
11) Finally, College Station is an arm-pit of a town. Quit pretending that =
it is a great college town. It is a town and there is a college there. That=
 should be the end of this comparison. If you feel that life doesn't get an=
y better than the Dixie Chicken, and enjoy being stuck in a never ending ""D=
ukes of Hazard"" episode, then move there. More importantly, don't move to A=
ustin.....they are trying to create an educated, technological, and open mi=

To:=09Hernandez, Juan; Miller, Jeffrey; Gilbert, Gerald; 'ksanders@entergy.=
com'
Subject:=09From the Jim Rome Show talking about A & M



1) They won't shut up. They have to go on about spirit, and old army, and r=
ed ass, and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their=
 urine to beat UT, and blah blah blah. Shut up. You start to get the feelin=
g the entire school was built to spite UT.=20
2) Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the 1870's passe=
d legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsi=
diary branch of the main school (University of Texas) that would teach agri=
culture and mechanics. Aggies love to say their school is older, from where=
 they get that I don't now......the fact is, the State intended A&M to be a=
 branch of UT. They are like the afterbirth from the original creation. Lik=
e Danny Devito in ""Twins"".=20
3) So they apparently have this complex, so much so, that they must devote =
their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good. Al=
l the while, nobody at UT denies that A&M is a good school, yet they won't =
shut up. So they write a fight song......about?....Texas, and how they want=
 to beat them. They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell them how =
bad Texas is and how good A&M and all its traditions are. It is the world's=
 largest known case of penis envy, and it is manifested in everything A&M d=
oes.=20
4) The people at A&M. Now we all have friends who went to A&M or are at A&M=
. There are some nice people there. However...there is the Corp. East Texas=
' answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere. For every boy scout who never l=
earned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys, there is the Corp. Now, forget=
 the fact that A&M will actually let people with sub-par grades enroll if t=
hey agree to join the Corp. Forget the fact that the Corps looked like a Ge=
stapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field in 1995. Forget =
the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed a=
gainst them, and swept under the rug over the years, they just this past mo=
nth have had one Corps member bring charges against another Corps member wh=
o apparently had been propositioning others for a little actual sodomy. Not=
 only could I go on with more instances of idiocracy by these Khaki-clad-sh=
aven-headed-dorks, I am sure each of you have your own stories. The point i=
s: We all respect West Point, Annapolis, The Air Force Academy; however, no=
body respects the Corp. I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of th=
e military world. Just because you dress like the Army, and try and act lik=
e the Army, does not make you the Army. People at A&M don't even respect th=
ese clowns. It is not cool to shave your head and dress up. Halloween is on=
ly supposed to be one day of the year. If you want to carry guns and beat u=
p civilians, move to Israel.=20
5) It is even less cool to slobber on somebody's daughter on national telev=
ision and call it a tradition. Dry humping 18 year old girls in the stands =
at football games is not cool. Not only is it not cool, it should be agains=
t the law. I know that in College Station, students are just prone to mount=
 each other on the campus lawn, or in the middle of class, or anytime anyth=
ing good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start s=
ucking on her face. But everywhere else in the world, it is looked down upo=
n. Especially if you are doing it on my TV. That is why we have moved the g=
ame from Thanksgiving. Because people across the nation were gagging on the=
ir turkey when in the middle of watching a football game, some boy scout is=
 tongue thrashing some overweight co-ed during somebody's Thanksgiving dinn=
er. We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your=
 woeful offense manages to put points on the board. Some of these girls are=
 in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter. Screw that, forget ma=
ke-up, it is too late for that, just give them a veil.=20
6) ""t.u."" is not funny. It is NOT insulting. It is dumb. Just imagine if fo=
lks from Texas kept talking about M&A and giggling. That would not be funny=
. In fact, it would be retarded. That's why UT fans don't do it. Please lea=
rn.=20
7) You want to lose the image of country bumpkins, of a people fond of shee=
p, of people that aren't stupid? Then quit building things that fall down. =
Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV. Quit whooping =
in church. Quit whooping period. Quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoym=
ent of dead mammals. Quit spending your Friday nights practicing how to yel=
l. Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you're running for Governor. W=
hen you are filling out season ticket renewals, and the form asks for your =
phone #, H & W, quit putting 258-3999, Height 6'3"", Weight 185. Just, colle=
ctively, stop making asses of yourselves. Go to East Texas, tour every smal=
l town, and ask every red neck with a 5th grade education why they cheer fo=
r A&M and wear maroon. That is your fan base. This is why you are perceived=
 by the educated masses as stupid.=20
8) Nobody cares if you think your band is better. They might be louder, the=
y might march in neat little zig zags, but they have no musical ability. Th=
e point is, nobody cares who wins halftime. Quit getting geeked up about ma=
rching bands. I find it hard to believe you stood through your high school =
band's entire halftime performance. And why? Cause nobody cared then and no=
body cares now. Plus, you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do ca=
re. Why is it cool all of a sudden now that you're in college?=20
9) Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds. Perhaps the only =
justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an a=
nal probe. Oh wait...I understand now.=20
10) Dogs are not ladies. They don't look or smell like ladies. Dogs eat the=
ir own feces and should be treated accordingly.=20
11) Finally, College Station is an arm-pit of a town. Quit pretending that =
it is a great college town. It is a town and there is a college there. That=
 should be the end of this comparison. If you feel that life doesn't get an=
y better than the Dixie Chicken, and enjoy being stuck in a never ending ""D=
ukes of Hazard"" episode, then move there. More importantly, don't move to A=
ustin.....they are trying to create an educated, technological, and open mi=
nded population base. Austin is, and will continue to be, the birthplace an=
d final resting place of all that is cool. As my friend Stephen Johnson onc=
e said: ""If the world were ever to get an enema, College Station is where y=
ou would connect the hose."" If you go to school at A&M, please don't be an =

I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will ""water out"" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

I am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for western Canada.  We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shut-ins at a dollar.  I am going to put Steve South and Paul Lucci in charge of presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.  What do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.  Is it as simple as gathering and processing?

  There was this little guy sitting inside a bar, just looking at his
  drink. He didn't move for a half an hour.

  Then, this big trouble-making truck driver stepped up right next to him,
  took the drink from the guy, and just drank it all down.

  The poor man started crying.

  The truck driver said, ""Come on man, I was just joking. Here, I'll buy
  you another drink. I just can't stand to see a man crying.""

  ""No, it's not that."" the man said. ""Today is the worst day of my life.
  First, I overslept and was late for an important meeting. My boss became
  outraged and then fired me.

  ""When I left the building to go to my car, I found that it was stolen.
  The police said they could do nothing. I then got a cab to return home,
  and after I paid the cab driver and the cab had gone, I found that I left
  my wallet in the cab.

  ""I got home only to find my wife was in bed with the gardener. I left
  home depressed and came to this bar. And now, when I was thinking about
  putting an end to my life...

  ""... YOU show up and drink the poison.""

 submitted by Amber Tozer
 
On the very first day, God created the cow.  He said to the cow, ""Today I 
have created you!  As a cow, you must go to the field with the farmer all day 
long.  You will work all day under the sun!  I will give you a life span of 
50 years.""

The cow objected, ""What? This kind of tough life you want me to live for 50 
years? Let me have 20 years, and the 30 years I'll give back to you.""  So God 
agreed.

On the second day, God created the dog.  God said to the dog, ""What you are 
supposed to do is to sit all day by the door of your house.  Any people that 
come in, you will have to bark at them!  I'll give a life span of 20 years.""

The dog objected, ""What?  All day long to sit by the door? No way!  I give 
you back my other 10 years of life!""  So God agreed.

On the third day, God created the monkey.  He said to the monkey, ""Monkeys 
have to entertain people.  You've got to make them laugh and do monkey 
tricks.  I'll give you 20 years life span.""

The monkey objected. ""What?  Make them laugh?  Do monkey faces and tricks?  
Ten years will do, and the other 10 years I'll give you back.""  So God agreed.

On the fourth day, God created man and said to him, ""Your job is to sleep, 
eat, and play.  You will enjoy very much in your life.  All you need to do is 
to enjoy and do nothing.  This kind of life, I'll give you a 20 year life 
span.""

The man objected.  ""What?  Such a good life!  Eat, play, sleep, do nothing?  
Enjoy the best and you expect me to live only for 20 years?  No way, 
man!....Why don't we make a deal?  Since the cow gave you back 30 years, and 
the dog gave you back 10 years and the monkey gave you back 10 years, I will 
take them from you!  That makes my life span 70 years, right?""  So God agreed.

AND THAT'S WHY....
In our first 20 years, we eat, sleep, play, enjoy the best and do nothing 
much.  For the next 30 years, we work all day long, suffer and get to support 
the family.  For the next 10 years, we entertain our grandchildren by making 
monkey faces and monkey tricks.  And for the last 10 years, we stay at home, 
sit by the front door and bark at people! ",Abusive

that read ""Puppies for Sale.""

The signs have a way of attracting children.
Soon a little boy appeared at the sign and asked, ""How much are you gonna
sell
those puppies for?"".

The store owner replied, ""Anywhere from $30-$50.""
The little boy reached into his pocket and pulled out some change.
""I have $2.37, can I look at them?""

The store owner smiled and whistled.* Out of the kennel came his dog
named Lady, running down the aisle of his store followed by five little
puppies.* One puppy was lagging considerably behind.

Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy.* He
asked ""What's wrong with that little dog?""

The man explained that when the puppy was born the vet said that
this puppy had a bad hip socket and would limp for the rest of his life.

The little boy got really excited and said, ""That's the puppy I want to
buy!""

The man replied ""No, you don't want to buy that little dog. If you
really want him, I'll give him to you."" The little boy got upset. He
looked straight into the man's eyes and said ""I don't want you to give him
to
me.
He is worth every bit as much as the other dogs and I'll pay the full
price.* In fact I will give you $2.37 now and 50 cents every month until I
have him paid for.""

The man countered, ""You really don't want to buy this puppy son.
He is never gonna be able to run, jump and play like other puppies.""
The little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a
badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace.* He
looked up at the man and said, ""Well, I don't run so well myself and the
little puppy will need someone who understands.""

The man was now biting his bottom lip.* Tears welled up in his
eyes....He smiled and said, ""Son, I hope and pray that each and every one
of

these puppies will have an owner such as you.""

IN LIFE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE, BUT WHETHER SOMEONE
APPRECIATES YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE, ACCEPTS YOU AND LOVES YOU
UNCONDITIONALLY.




A REAL FRIEND IS ONE WHO WALKS IN WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD WALKS AWAY.

SEND THIS TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE YOU CONSIDER TO BE SPECIAL.

The woman is beginning to feel a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousness

rather stern voice, ""Skippy!""

The woman thought, ""This is great!"" and a big smile came across her face. A 
couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time, 
she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The 
father again looked and the dog and yelled, ""Dammit Skippy!""

Once again the woman smiled and thought ""Yes!"" A few minutes later the woman 
had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let 
rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing.

The signs have a way of attracting children.
Soon a little boy appeared at the sign and asked, ""How much are you gonna

those puppies for?"".

The store owner replied, ""Anywhere from $30-$50.""
The little boy reached into his pocket and pulled out some change.
""I have $2.37, can I look at them?""

The store owner smiled and whistled.* Out of the kennel came his dog
named Lady, running down the aisle of his store followed by five little
puppies.* One puppy was lagging considerably behind.

Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy.* He
asked ""What's wrong with that little dog?""

The man explained that when the puppy was born the vet said that
this puppy had a bad hip socket and would limp for the rest of his life.

The little boy got really excited and said, ""That's the puppy I want to
buy!""

The man replied ""No, you don't want to buy that little dog. If you
really want him, I'll give him to you."" The little boy got upset. He
looked straight into the man's eyes and said ""I don't want you to give him
to
me.
He is worth every bit as much as the other dogs and I'll pay the full
price.* In fact I will give you $2.37 now and 50 cents every month until I
have him paid for.""

The man countered, ""You really don't want to buy this puppy son.
He is never gonna be able to run, jump and play like other puppies.""
The little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a
badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace.* He
looked up at the man and said, ""Well, I don't run so well myself and the
little puppy will need someone who understands.""

The man was now biting his bottom lip.* Tears welled up in his
eyes....He smiled and said, ""Son, I hope and pray that each and every one
of

these puppies will have an owner such as you.""

 submitted by Amber Tozer
 
On the very first day, God created the cow.  He said to the cow, ""Today I 
have created you!  As a cow, you must go to the field with the farmer all day 
long.  You will work all day under the sun!  I will give you a life span of 
50 years.""

The cow objected, ""What? This kind of tough life you want me to live for 50 
years? Let me have 20 years, and the 30 years I'll give back to you.""  So God 
agreed.

On the second day, God created the dog.  God said to the dog, ""What you are 
supposed to do is to sit all day by the door of your house.  Any people that 
come in, you will have to bark at them!  I'll give a life span of 20 years.""

The dog objected, ""What?  All day long to sit by the door? No way!  I give 
you back my other 10 years of life!""  So God agreed.

On the third day, God created the monkey.  He said to the monkey, ""Monkeys 
have to entertain people.  You've got to make them laugh and do monkey 
tricks.  I'll give you 20 years life span.""

The monkey objected. ""What?  Make them laugh?  Do monkey faces and tricks?  
Ten years will do, and the other 10 years I'll give you back.""  So God agreed.

On the fourth day, God created man and said to him, ""Your job is to sleep, 
eat, and play.  You will enjoy very much in your life.  All you need to do is 
to enjoy and do nothing.  This kind of life, I'll give you a 20 year life 
span.""

The man objected.  ""What?  Such a good life!  Eat, play, sleep, do nothing?  
Enjoy the best and you expect me to live only for 20 years?  No way, 
man!....Why don't we make a deal?  Since the cow gave you back 30 years, and 
the dog gave you back 10 years and the monkey gave you back 10 years, I will 
take them from you!  That makes my life span 70 years, right?""  So God agreed.

AND THAT'S WHY....
In our first 20 years, we eat, sleep, play, enjoy the best and do nothing 
much.  For the next 30 years, we work all day long, suffer and get to support 
the family.  For the next 10 years, we entertain our grandchildren by making 
monkey faces and monkey tricks.  And for the last 10 years, we stay at home, 
sit by the front door and bark at people! ",Abusive

 Gathered Cotton, white

An Israeli friend recently informed me that the UK fought the Islamic terrorist attacks by burying the criminals with a pig.  Apparently the Islamic belief is that if ones' body is buried with a pig (because they are considered unclean) their soul will go to hell.  I did a little research into this subject matter and found it to be true. This got me thinking.  If we put a baby pig on every airline flight then all suicide terrorists would abort their missions as they would not want their souls to go to hell.  Additionally, if we drop-shipped, oh say, 100,000 pigs into Afghanistan I think our recon and assault efforts may be more successful.  Apparently Muslims dislike the very sight of pigs A LOT!  They are also adamantly opposed to alcohol, thus we spike their water supply with a few thousand gallons of cosmopolitans, get them shit-faced, and turn the pigs loose.  The  war would be over in a weekend.  ...Just a thought.

How to give cats and dogs pills.

HOW TO GIVE A CAT A PILL

1) Pick cat up and cradle it in the crook of your left arm as if  holding a
baby.
Position right forefinger and thumb on either side of cat's mouth and
gently
apply pressure to cheeks while holding pill in right hand. As cat opens
mouth pop pill into mouth. Allow cat to close mouth and swallow.

tightly with left hand. Force jaws open and push pill to back of mouth with
right forefinger. Hold
mouth shut for a count of ten.

5) Retrieve pill from goldfish bowl and cat from top of wardrobe.  Call
spouse from garden.

6) Kneel on floor with cat wedged firmly between knees, hold front and rear
paws. Ignore low growls emitted by cat. Get spouse to hold head firmly with
one hand while forcing
wooden ruler into mouth. Drop pill down ruler and rub cat's throat
vigorously.

7) Retrieve cat from curtain rail, get another pill from foil wrap. Make
note to buy new ruler and repair curtains. Carefully sweep shattered
figurines and vases from hearth and set to one side for gluing later.

8) Wrap cat in large towel and get spouse to lie on cat with head just
visible from below armpit. Put pill in end of drinking straw, force mouth
open with pencil and blow down
drinking straw.

9) Check label to make sure pill not harmful to humans, drink 1 beer to
take
taste away. Apply Band-Aid to spouse's forearm and remove blood from carpet
with cold water and soap.

10) Retrieve cat from neighbor's shed. Get another pill.  Open another
beer.
Place cat in cupboard and close door onto neck to leave head showing. Force
mouth open with dessert
spoon. Flick pill down throat with elastic band.

11) Fetch screwdriver from garage and put cupboard door back on hinges.
Drink beer. Fetch bottle of scotch. Pour shot, drink. Apply  cold compress
to cheek and check records for
date of last tetanus jab.  Apply whiskey compress to cheek to disinfect.
Toss back another shot. Throw Tee-shirt away and fetch new one from
bedroom.

12) Ring fire brigade to retrieve the friggin' cat from tree across the
road. Apologize to neighbor who crashed into fence while swerving to avoid
cat. Take last pill from
foil-wrap.

13) Tie the little bastard's front paws to rear paws with garden twine  and
bind
tightly to leg of dining room table, find heavy duty pruning gloves from
shed. Push pill into mouth followed by large piece of fillet steak.   Be
rough about it. Hold head vertically and pour 2 pints of water down throat
to wash pill down.

14) Consume remainder of Scotch. Get spouse to drive you to the emergency
room, sit quietly while doctor sitches fingers and forearm and removes pill
remnants from right eye.
Call furniture shop on way home to order new table.

15) Arrange for SPCA to collect mutant cat from hell and ring local pet
shop
to see if they have any hamsters.

I have a quick question.  I need your expert opinion...

I am about to order a bedskirt from Chambers and of the 3 they offer with
18"" drops, which do you think would look best with my bed?
 Hem-Stitched, white,straight, flat look
 Gathered Cotton, white
  or, Voile Layered over Cotton, white.

Let me know what you think if you get a chance.

Also, at Linens, Unlimited on West Gray, I found a white cotton gathered
skirt that you pin on to your mattress at whatever placement you want.  It
costs $160.  The ones at Chambers are around $100., plus shipping.

      Tulips 

      The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.
      Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.
      I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly
      As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.
      I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.
      I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses
      And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.

      They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff
      Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.
      Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.
      The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,
      They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,
      Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,
      So it is impossible to tell how many there are.

      My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water
      Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
      They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep
      Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage
      My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,
      My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;
      Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.

      I have let things slip, a thirty-year~old cargo boat
      Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.
      They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.
      Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley
      I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books
      Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.
      I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.

      I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted
      To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
      How free it is, you have no idea how free -
      The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
      And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
      It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
      Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

      The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
      Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
      Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
      Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
      They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down
      Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
      A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

      Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
      The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
      Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
      And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
      Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
      And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself
      The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

      Before they came the air was calm enough,
      Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
      Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
      Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
      Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
      They concentrate my attention, that was happy
      Playing and resting without committing itself.

      The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
      The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
      They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
      And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
      Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
      The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
      And comes from a country far away as health.",Abusive

      Tulips 

      The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.
      Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.
      I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly
      As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.
      I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.
      I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses
      And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.

      They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff
      Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.
      Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.
      The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,
      They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,
      Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,
      So it is impossible to tell how many there are.

      My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water
      Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
      They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep
      Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage
      My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,
      My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;
      Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.

      I have let things slip, a thirty-year~old cargo boat
      Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.
      They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.
      Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley
      I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books
      Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.
      I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.

      I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted
      To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
      How free it is, you have no idea how free -
      The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
      And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
      It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
      Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

      The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
      Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
      Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
      Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
      They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down
      Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
      A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

      Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
      The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
      Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
      And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
      Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
      And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself
      The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

      Before they came the air was calm enough,
      Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
      Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
      Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
      Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
      They concentrate my attention, that was happy
      Playing and resting without committing itself.

      The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
      The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
      They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
      And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
      Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
      The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
      And comes from a country far away as health.",Abusive

      Tulips 

      The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.
      Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.
      I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly
      As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.
      I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.
      I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses
      And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.

      They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff
      Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.
      Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.
      The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,
      They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,
      Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,
      So it is impossible to tell how many there are.

      My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water
      Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
      They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep
      Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage
      My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,
      My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;
      Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.

      I have let things slip, a thirty-year~old cargo boat
      Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.
      They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.
      Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley
      I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books
      Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.
      I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.

      I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted
      To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
      How free it is, you have no idea how free -
      The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
      And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
      It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
      Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

      The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
      Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
      Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
      Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
      They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down
      Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
      A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

      Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
      The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
      Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
      And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
      Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
      And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself
      The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

      Before they came the air was calm enough,
      Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
      Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
      Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
      Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
      They concentrate my attention, that was happy
      Playing and resting without committing itself.

      The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
      The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
      They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
      And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
      Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
      The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
      And comes from a country far away as health.",Abusive

Unfortunately, in the last two weeks we have had two of our Research ""chairs""
disappear from their location.  We have reported this to Security, but in all
likelihood they will be almost impossible to locate. 

Facilities has told us that they are not responsible for missing chairs and we
will have to order new ones.   Since they are very expensive,  we have 
decided to ""mark"" our chairs underneath the seat with a location or name.  
Sam is going to order some ""silver or white"" markers and we will begin 
marking 
each chair.

It is a shame we have to do this, but know of no other alternative.  We will 
let you

      Tulips 

      The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.
      Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.
      I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly
      As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.
      I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.
      I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses
      And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.

      They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff
      Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.
      Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.
      The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,
      They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,
      Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,
      So it is impossible to tell how many there are.

      My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water
      Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
      They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep
      Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage
      My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,
      My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;
      Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.

      I have let things slip, a thirty-year~old cargo boat
      Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.
      They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.
      Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley
      I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books
      Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.
      I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.

      I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted
      To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
      How free it is, you have no idea how free -
      The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
      And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
      It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
      Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

      The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
      Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
      Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
      Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
      They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down
      Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
      A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

      Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
      The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
      Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
      And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
      Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
      And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself
      The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

      Before they came the air was calm enough,
      Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
      Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
      Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
      Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
      They concentrate my attention, that was happy
      Playing and resting without committing itself.

      The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
      The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
      They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
      And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
      Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
      The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
      And comes from a country far away as health.",Abusive

		 Subject: Re-cap of Rep Caucus Briefing

The Republican Caucus briefing Thursday was well attended, and members were
appreciative of the fact that Jan and other members of IEP took the time to
brief them.  The feedback we've heard from Republican Leader Bill Campbell's
office and others is that the handouts IEP provided were great, and the
presentations very informative.  In fact, several members acknowledged that
they had never heard the message communicated in such a clear, concise way.

Just fyi, one issue that is on the radar screen of Republicans is the fact
that generators have not been paid -- yet they still continue to supply
electricity to California.

We have offered to brief the Democrat Caucus, but they have not expressed
interest thus far.  We will continue trying!

Below is a list of those who attended the meeting.

Thanks,
Jean

The Wisdom of Will Rogers

Don't squat with your spurs on.

Good  judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad  
judgment.

Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin'  it back in.

If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every  now and then to 
make sure it's still there.

If you get to thinkin' you're  a person of some influence, try orderin' 
somebody else's dog  around.

After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he  started 
roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him... The  moral: 
When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.

Never kick a cow  chip on a hot day.

There's two theories to arguin' with a woman. Neither  one works.

If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop  diggin'.

Never slap a man who's chewin' tobacco.

It don't take a  genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep.

Always drink upstream from the  herd.

When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't  be 
surprised if they learn their lesson.

When you're throwin' your weight  around, be ready to have it thrown around 
by somebody else.

The quickest  way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in 
your  pocket.

Never miss a good chance to shut up.

There are three kinds  of men. The one that learns by reading. The few who 
learn by observation. The  rest of them have to pee on the electric fence 
for  themselves.

The Republican Caucus briefing Thursday was well attended, and members were
appreciative of the fact that Jan and other members of IEP took the time to
brief them.  The feedback we've heard from Republican Leader Bill Campbell's
office and others is that the handouts IEP provided were great, and the
presentations very informative.  In fact, several members acknowledged that
they had never heard the message communicated in such a clear, concise way.

Just fyi, one issue that is on the radar screen of Republicans is the fact
that generators have not been paid -- yet they still continue to supply
electricity to California.

We have offered to brief the Democrat Caucus, but they have not expressed
interest thus far.  We will continue trying!

Below is a list of those who attended the meeting.

Thanks,
Jean

The Wisdom of Will Rogers

Don't squat with your spurs on.

Good  judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad  
judgment.

Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin'  it back in.

If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every  now and then to 
make sure it's still there.

If you get to thinkin' you're  a person of some influence, try orderin' 
somebody else's dog  around.

After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he  started 
roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him... The  moral: 
When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.

Never kick a cow  chip on a hot day.

There's two theories to arguin' with a woman. Neither  one works.

If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop  diggin'.

Never slap a man who's chewin' tobacco.

It don't take a  genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep.

Always drink upstream from the  herd.

When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't  be 
surprised if they learn their lesson.

When you're throwin' your weight  around, be ready to have it thrown around 
by somebody else.

The quickest  way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in 
your  pocket.

Never miss a good chance to shut up.

There are three kinds  of men. The one that learns by reading. The few who 
learn by observation. The  rest of them have to pee on the electric fence 
for  themselves.

		 Subject: Re-cap of Rep Caucus Briefing

The Republican Caucus briefing Thursday was well attended, and members were
appreciative of the fact that Jan and other members of IEP took the time to
brief them.  The feedback we've heard from Republican Leader Bill Campbell's
office and others is that the handouts IEP provided were great, and the
presentations very informative.  In fact, several members acknowledged that
they had never heard the message communicated in such a clear, concise way.

Just fyi, one issue that is on the radar screen of Republicans is the fact
that generators have not been paid -- yet they still continue to supply
electricity to California.

We have offered to brief the Democrat Caucus, but they have not expressed
interest thus far.  We will continue trying!

Below is a list of those who attended the meeting.

Thanks,
Jean

The Wisdom of Will Rogers

Don't squat with your spurs on.

Good  judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad  
judgment.

Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin'  it back in.

If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every  now and then to 
make sure it's still there.

If you get to thinkin' you're  a person of some influence, try orderin' 
somebody else's dog  around.

After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he  started 
roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him... The  moral: 
When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.

Never kick a cow  chip on a hot day.

There's two theories to arguin' with a woman. Neither  one works.

If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop  diggin'.

Never slap a man who's chewin' tobacco.

It don't take a  genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep.

Always drink upstream from the  herd.

When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't  be 
surprised if they learn their lesson.

When you're throwin' your weight  around, be ready to have it thrown around 
by somebody else.

The quickest  way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in 
your  pocket.

Never miss a good chance to shut up.

There are three kinds  of men. The one that learns by reading. The few who 
learn by observation. The  rest of them have to pee on the electric fence 
for  themselves.

		 Subject: Re-cap of Rep Caucus Briefing

The Republican Caucus briefing Thursday was well attended, and members were
appreciative of the fact that Jan and other members of IEP took the time to
brief them.  The feedback we've heard from Republican Leader Bill Campbell's
office and others is that the handouts IEP provided were great, and the
presentations very informative.  In fact, several members acknowledged that
they had never heard the message communicated in such a clear, concise way.

Just fyi, one issue that is on the radar screen of Republicans is the fact
that generators have not been paid -- yet they still continue to supply
electricity to California.

We have offered to brief the Democrat Caucus, but they have not expressed
interest thus far.  We will continue trying!

Below is a list of those who attended the meeting.

Thanks,
Jean

Beau Normark (sp?), ABB President is coming for a visit to the local ABB office and wants to meet with excelr as part of a general meet n' greet (as suspected).

They don't have any particular agenda in mind, but will probably want to talk a bit about the business relationship excelr and ABB have enjoyed in the past, our current projects (e.g. TexMex) and any plans we might care to share about the future.

Hello, only  me!
 
Happy New Year to  you and your family!  I hope you all had a lovely Christmas & New Year.   
 
I ate too much and  didn't drink enough because I wanted to be able to drive and visit people.   The first drink I had was New Year's Eve, my mum and I went over to my brother  & his girlfriend in Hayes (I DROVE & MY MUM SURVIVED!).   We went out for a meal and stayed the night so I could have a drink.   It's the first New Years my brother and I have ever spent with our mum so  it was very nice.
 
I'd love to see some  pictures of little Scott's first Christmas.
 
Take care & all  the best for 2002

Dog Fight

George and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all.  They sat down 
and decided to settle the whole dispute with one big dog fight.  They agreed

that they would have five years to breed the best fighting  dogs in the 
world and whosever dog won would be entitled to dominate the world.

Osama and his dog handler Mohammed found the biggest, meanest Dobermans and 
Rottweilers in the world, then bred them with the biggest, meanest Siberian 
wolves they could find. From the litters, they selected the biggest and 
strongest puppy and trained it day and night to fight to the death.

After five years Osama and Mohammed came up with the biggest, meanest dog 
the world had ever seen.  It's cage needed steel bars that were five inches 
thick and nobody could get near it.

When the day came for the dog fight, George and his dog handler Boudreaux, 
showed up with a nine foot long Dachshund.  It was the strangest looking dog

anyone had ever seen.  Boudreaux said it was a Cajun Dachshund.

Everyone felt sorry for George and Boudreaux because they knew there was no 
way that this poor excuse for a dog could possibly last 10 seconds with 
Osama's big, mean animal.

When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund slowly came out of it's cage, 
wagged it's tail, then waddled over towards Osama's dog.

The Doberman/Rottweiler/Wolf snarled and leaped out of it's cage,then 
charged the poor Dachshund.  But when it got close enough to bite the 
Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened it's mouth and ate Osama's dog in one

bite. There was nothing left at all of the snarling beast.

Osama came up to George and Boudreaux shaking his head in disbelief.  ""We 
don't understand how this could have happened.  We had our best people 
working for five years with the biggest, meanest Dobermans and Rottweilers, 
and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves in the world.  How did you do this?""

""Da's easy"", said Boudreaux, the Cajun.  ""We 'ad our bess plasic surgins 
workin' fo' five year for to make dat alligator look like a weenie dog.""

> >> stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the
> >> awkwardness of what just occurred.
> >>
> >> COURTESY FLUSH
> >> Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone
> >> of the
> >> poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed
> >> location.  This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink
> >> up the
> >> bathroom.  This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF
> >> SHAME.
> >>
> >> WALK OF SHAME
> >> Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you

> >> Definition: A colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it.

> >>
> >> THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN)
> >> Definition:  A group of coworkers who band together to ensure

> >> pooping"" goes off without incident.  This group can help you to

> >> whereabouts of OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS.
> >>
> >> SAFE HAVEN
> >> Definition:  A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where

> >> Definition: A phony cough which alerts all new entrants into the

> >> that you are in a stall.  This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON or

> >> Definition:  A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential TURD

>>9.? A blowjob will always get a woman off a speeding ticket. 
>>10. All women are noisy fucks. 
>>11. People in the 70's couldn't fuck unless there was a wild guitar solo 
>>??? in the background. 
>>12. Those tits are real. 
>>13. A common and enjoyable sexual practice for a man is to take his 
>>??? half-erect penis and slap it repeatedly on a woman's butt. 
>>14. Men always groan ""OH YEAH!"" when they cum. 
>>15. If there is two of them they ""high five"" each other.(and the girl 
>>??? isn't disgusted!) 
>>16. Double penetration makes women smile. 
>>17. Asian men don't exist.

>>??? bushes, the boyfriend won't bash seven shades of shit out of you 
>>??? if you shove your cock in his girlfriend's mouth. 
>>19. There's a plot. 
>>20. When taking a woman from behind, a man can really excite a woman by 
>>??? giving her a gentle slap on the butt. 
>>21. Nurses suck patient's cocks. 
>>22. Men always pull out. 
>>23. When your girlfriend busts you getting head from her best friend, 
>>??? she'll only be momentarily pissed off before fucking the both of

Lenny! jumping in the conversation without missing a beat....good to have
you with us. Nice comedy....but the only fat, bald 30 year old is the
Dogger. (just kidding dog, you's not fat....you's just fluffy). Don is
bald, but not fat. Roby is balding, but just a little ""stocky"". Clint has a
belly, but is not balding. Other than that, we are all pretty normal
(please use that term loosely).

Your parents would love to have us at their crib. Dog could rummage through
all of your belongings, eat all of your parents' food, and wake them up at
the ass crack of dawn with scrambled eggs and jumby. Roby could show your
mom ""a good time"". Porteous, Clay, and Myers could talk to your dad about
his company's legal shortcomings. Bernie could sell you all some much
needed life insurance. Clint could smoke, and Dehart could clear his lungs
so that he could ski without falling dead on the slopes. Gooch could lend
Don the money to build an addition to your maw's bathroom (so that Dog and
Roby could smell it up). And Naquin could try to get with your sister, take
notes of the whole weekend's proceedings, and make copies for all of us to
remember them by.

Porthole....see if Timmy, Tricia, Mike Thomas, etc. would be interested in
going on the trip...Lenny....see about all of your Houston Fiji buddies
(house bitch, Tim, Val, etc.). Tell Tim we'll let him bring his new wife
with him, too, although that might mean that there could be up to 3 Phi
Mu's on the trip....quorum could be met, and ""the Phi Mu Crew"" might be in
full effect; God help us.

Clint, what about Freret and Dawn (that might make 4 Mu's)?

Anyone else we can think of who might be interested in this trip (Jan 10 -
14th)?

whipping of the 14th ranked Colorado Buffalo.
I am very dissapointed - I had one of my to-do's this week was to send you
a note to take another $100 of your dollars by giving you the 10 points -
it looks like you would have needed 30+ though.
Either CU is OVERRATED or more like The Horns are some bad ass hausses.
The truth is that The Horns can beat any team in the nation any weekend.

I would enjoy the ass-whipping the Horns would lay on the Cajun Bitches
from the Red Stick (lsu sucks).

I guess being a Colorado Coonass means you get punked by the Horns twice -
CU and Lousyanna State both being inferior to the Horns.

   If a dog were your teacher, you would learn stuff like: 
   When loved ones come home, always run to greet them. 
   Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joyride. 
   Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure ecstasy. 
   When it's in your best interest, practice obedience. 
   Let others know when they've invaded your territory. 
   Take naps. Stretch before rising. 
   Run, romp, and play daily. 
   Thrive on attention and let people touch you. 
   Avoid biting when a simple growl will do. 
   On warm days, stop to lie on your back on the grass. 
   On hot days, drink lots of water and lie under a shady tree. 
   When you're happy, dance around and wag your entire body. 
   No matter how often you're scolded, don't buy into the guilt thing 
   and pout ... run right back and make friends. 
   Delight in the simple joy of a long walk. 
   Eat with gusto and enthusiasm. Stop when you have had enough. 
   Be loyal. 
   Never pretend to be something you're not. 
   If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it. 
   When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by and nuzzle 
   them gently.

Little Johnny


LITTLE JOHNNY AND THE CONDOM
Little Johnny walked into his dad's bedroom one day only to catch him
sitting on the side of his bed sliding a condom onto his penis in
preparation of sex with his wife. Johnny's father in an attempt to hide his
full erection with a condom on it bent over as if to look under the bed.
Little Johnny asked curiously ""What ya doin dad? His father quickly
replied, ""I thought I saw a rat go underneath the bed."" To which Little
Johnny replied ""What ya gonna do, fuck him?""

LITTLE JOHNNY AND THE VAGINA
Little Johnny's mother decided to give her son an anatomy lesson one day,
so she took off all of her clothes and pointed to her vagina, and said,
""Johnny, this is where you come from."" Johnny went to school the next day
smiling and insisting that all his friends now refer to him as Lucky Johnny
""Why?"" one asked. Johnny held his fingers an inch apart and said, ""Because
I came this close to being a turd.""

LITTLE JOHNNY, THE SMART ASS
A traveling salesman rings the doorbell and 10-year-old Little Johnny
answers, holding a beer and smoking a fat cigar.  The salesman says, little
boy, is your mother home?"" Little Johnny taps his ash on the carpet and
says, ""What the fuck do you think?""

LITTLE JOHNNY AND TEACHERS
Little Johnny returns from school and says he got an F in arithmetic
""Why?""  asks the father. ""The teacher asked 'How much is 2x3?' I said '6'""
""But that's right!""  ""Then she asked me 'How much is 3x2?'"" ""What's the
fucking difference?""  asks the father. ""That's what I said!"" replied Little
Johnny

JOHNNY AND THE MULTI-SYLLABLE WORD
Little Johnny goes to school, and the teacher says, 'Today we are going to
learn multi-syllable words, class. Does anybody have an example of a
multi-syllable word?' Little Johnny waves his hand, 'Me, Miss Rogers,  me,
me!' Miss
Rogers: All right, little Johnny, what is your multi-syllable word?  Little
Johnny says, 'Mas-tur-bate.' Miss Rogers smiles and says,'Wow, little
Johnny, that's a mouthful.' Little Johnny says, 'No, Miss Rogers,you're
thinking of a blowjob.""

LITTLE JOHNNY AND BABIES
Little Johnny came running into the house and asked, ""Mommy, can little
girls have babies?"" ""No,"" said his Mom, ""of course not."" Little Johnny
then ran back outside and his Mom heard him yell to his friends, ""It's
okay, we can play that game again!""

LITTLE JOHNNY AND GOING TO THE BATHROOM
Little Johnny was sitting in class one day. All of the sudden, he needed to
go to the bathroom. He yelled out, ""Miss Jones, I need to take a piss!"" The
teacher replied, ""Now, Johnny, that is NOT the proper word to use in this
situation. The correct word you want to use is 'urinate.' Please use the
word 'urinate' in a sentence correctly, and I will allow you to go."" Little
Johnny thinks for a bit, then says, ""You're an eight too, but if you had
bigger tits, you'd be a ten!""

LITTLE JOHNNY AND GRAMMAR
One day, during a lesson on proper grammar, the teacher asked for a show of
hands from those who could use the word ""beautiful"" in the same sentence
twice. First, she called on little Suzy, who responded with, ""My father
bought my mother a beautiful dress and she looked beautiful in it."" ""Very
good, Suzy,"" replied the teacher. She then called on little Michael. ""My
mommy planned a beautiful banquet and it turned out beautifully,"" he
said.   ""Excellent, Michael!"" Then, the teacher called on little Johnny.
""Last night, at the dinner table, my sister told my father that she was
pregnant,  and he said, 'Beautiful, .......just fucking beautiful!'""

A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.

A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.

12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.

bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.",Abusive

I am watching the fourth quarter of the 9th Ranked Texas Longhorn as
whipping of the 14th ranked Colorado Buffalo.
I am very dissapointed - I had one of my to-do's this week was to send you
a note to take another $100 of your dollars by giving you the 10 points -
it looks like you would have needed 30+ though.
Either CU is OVERRATED or more like The Horns are some bad ass hausses.
The truth is that The Horns can beat any team in the nation any weekend.

I would enjoy the ass-whipping the Horns would lay on the Cajun Bitches
from the Red Stick (lsu sucks).

I guess being a Colorado Coonass means you get punked by the Horns twice -
CU and Lousyanna State both being inferior to the Horns.

Let me start off by saying YOU MYOPIC, NEARSIGHTED LITTLE FUCK.  Have you
ever been to Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night?  Have you ever heard the
Tiger Band from Tigerland play as the Tigers take the field?  Were you not
there in 1997 when we beat the shit out of the then ranked #1 Florida
Gators?  If you didn't write about sports, would you still feel like a man?
I bet the answer to all of these questions is a resounding NO.  You never
hear any other columnists or coaches banging on other venues within their
conferences because of the respect and pride they have of their own
conference.  You don't deserve the SEC and you don't deserve to write about
it.

I hope you are at the game Saturday night.  Win or lose, a few things will
definitely happen.  1)Before the game, you will get a rush hearing the Tiger
band make their way to the stadium.  2)You will get a rush when the Tigers
run out on the field.  3)You will hold your ears like a pussy when you hear
a crowd like you've never heard before.  4)And lastly, you will wish you
went to LSU.

Wouldn't it be great to have a time machine? If you had traveled
back to 1991 and invested a cool $10,000 in Cisco, you'd have
made more than $1 million by now. Or if you'd journeyed back to
1987 and bought a little Microsoft, well, you'd probably own a
large tropical island today.

we're offering you the next best thing=01(

Subject: RSVP: August 25 - Introduction to the Electric Industry


By now I'm sure that you've heard about the upcoming electric industry class 
that has been customized for GPG staff.   The purpose of the class is to 
learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the 
current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn 
about the economics of electric generation.   

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with 
remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in 
the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a 
working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be 
distributed to you a week prior to the class.  

I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per 
student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please 
RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a 
count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG 
attendees.

Subject: RSVP: August 25 - Introduction to the Electric Industry


By now I'm sure that you've heard about the upcoming electric industry class 
that has been customized for GPG staff.   The purpose of the class is to 
learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the 
current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn 
about the economics of electric generation.   

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with 
remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in 
the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a 
working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be 
distributed to you a week prior to the class.  

I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per 
student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please 
RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a 
count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG 
attendees.

Subject: FW: Even For You 
Because in some ways, you have these traits and must 
do these things as well. 
Mother's Day 
If you send this to just one person, it should make it 
all the way around 
by Mother's Day. 
This is for all the mothers who have sat up all night 
with sick toddlers 
in their arms, wiping up barf laced with Oscar Mayer 
wieners and cherry 
Kool-Aid saying, ""It's OK honey, Mommy's here."" 
Who walk around the house all night with their babies 
when they keep 
crying and won't stop. 
This is for all the mothers who show up at work with 
spit-up in their 
hair and milk stains on their blouses and diapers in 
their purse. 
For all the mothers who run carpools and make cookies 
and sew Halloween 
costumes. And all the mothers who DON'T. 
This is for the mothers who gave birth to babies 
they'll never see. And 
the mothers who took those babies and gave them homes. 
This is for all the mothers who froze their buns off 
on metal bleachers 
at football or soccer games Friday night instead of 
watching from cars, so 
that when their kids asked, ""Did you see me?"" they 
could say, ""Of course, I 
wouldn't have missed it for the world,"" and mean it. 
This is for all the mothers who yell at their kids in 
the grocery store 
and swat them in despair when they stomp their feet 
like a tired 2-year old 
who wants ice cream before dinner. 
This is for all the mothers who sat down with their 
children and 
explained all about making babies. And for all the 
mothers who wanted to but just couldn't. 
For all the mothers who read ""Goodnight, Moon"" twice a 
night for a year. 
And then read it again.  ""Just one more time."" 
This is for all the mothers who taught their children 
to tie their 
shoelaces before they started school. And for all the 
mothers who opted for Velcro instead. 
This is for all the mothers who teach their sons to 
cook and their 
daughters to sink a jump shot. 
This is for all mothers whose heads turn automatically 
when a little 
voice calls ""Mom?"" in a crowd, even though they know 
their own off spring are at home. 
This is for all the mothers who sent their kids to 
school with stomach 
aches, assuring them they'd be just FINE once they got 
there, only to get 
calls from the school nurse an hour later asking them 
to please pick them 
up.  Right away. 
This is for mothers whose children have gone astray, 
who can't find the 
words to reach them. 
For all the mothers who bite their lips sometimes 
until they bleed when 
their 14 year olds dye their hair green. 
What makes a good Mother anyway? 
Is it patience? 
Compassion? 
Broad hips? 
The ability to nurse a baby, cook dinner, and sew a 
button on a shirt, 
all at the same time? 
Or is it heart? Is it the ache you feel when you watch 
your son or 
daughter disappear down the street, walking to school 
alone for the very first 
time? 
The jolt that takes you from sleep to dread, from bed 
to crib at 2 A.M. 
to put your hand on the back of a sleeping baby? 
The need to flee from wherever you are and hug your 
child when you hear 
news of a fire, a car accident, a child dying? 
For all the mothers of the victims of all these school 
shootings, and the 
mothers of those who did the shooting. For the mothers 
of the survivors, 
and the mothers who sat in front of their TVs in 
horror, hugging their child 
who just came home from school, safely. 
This is for mothers who put pinwheels and teddy bears 
on their children's 
graves. 
This is for young mothers stumbling through diaper 
changes and sleep 
deprivation. 
And mature mothers learning to let go. 
For working mothers and stay-at-home mothers. 
Single mothers and married mothers. 
Mothers with money, mothers without. 
This is for you all. 
So hang in there. 
Please pass along to all the Mom's in your life. 
""Home is what catches you when you fall - and we all 
fall."" 
Please pass this to all the wonderful mothers you 
know. 
(I just did)

restaurant.

The attractive waitress asks Cheney what he would like and he replies, ""I'll
have a bowl of oatmeal and some fruit.""

""And what can I get for you, sir?"" she asks George W.

He replies, ""How about a quickie?""

""Why, Mr. President,"" the waitress says, ""How rude . . . you're starting to

Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk"". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

Dear Tech Support,

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a
slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had
operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0
uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed
undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.

Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes
the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to
no avail. What can I do?

Desperate

> >---------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Desperate,

First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package,
while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the
command <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.

Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and
Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to
Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad
program that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.

DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend
program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.

In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a
limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider
buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend
Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.

Good luck.

Subject: RSVP: August 25 - Introduction to the Electric Industry


By now I'm sure that you've heard about the upcoming electric industry class 
that has been customized for GPG staff.   The purpose of the class is to 
learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the 
current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn 
about the economics of electric generation.   

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with 
remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in 
the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a 
working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be 
distributed to you a week prior to the class.  

I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per 
student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please 
RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a 
count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG 
attendees.

TW Operations have been running pigs from Station 9 to P1 and from P1 to P2.  176 barrels of water have been received at P2.  Large amounts of water are beginning to show at P3.  The field has planned to run pigs from P2 to P3 today or tomorrow.  Owens Corning is on this leg between P2 and P3 and because of the large amounts of water they may be shut in for one day.

Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk"". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

Sandie lost her husband almost four  years ago 
and still has not gotten out of her depression - 
mourning as  if it were only yesterday. Her daughter 
is constantly calling her and  urging her to get 
back into the world. 
Finally, Sandie says she'd go  out, but didn't 
know anyone. Her daughter immediately replies, 
""Mama!  I have someone for you to meet."" Well, it was 
an immediate hit. They took  to one another and after 
dating for six weeks he asks her to join him for  a 
weekend in the Catskills.
    And we know what that meant.
Their first night there she undresses as he 
does. There she  stood nude except for a pair of 
black lacy panties. He in his birthday  suit. 
Looking at her he asks, ""Why the black panties?"" 
She replies,  ""My breasts you can fondle, my 
body is yours to explore, but down there I  am still 
in mourning."" 
He knows he's not getting lucky that night.  
The following night the same scenario. She's 
standing there with the  black panties on and he is 
in his birthday suit; except that he has an  
erection, on which he has a black condom. 
She looks at him and asks,  ""What's with 
this...a black condom?"" 
He replies, ""I'd like to offer my  condolences."" ",Abusive

Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk"". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

Or is that a picture of you at the new Vail condo? If it's at the Vail condo then it's ok that you're gay.  

So what's up with you? I see the ski trip is starting to take form. You know we have to go meet the All Girl Ski team.
So are you getting ready for them? Damn they about killed me last time. Those steep, tight tree trails. And then the last run of the day - the ski run from hell.    

I was just thinking. Have you ever been to my place? (reminder to Pual: Donnie is not gay) One of these days if you're in town maybe a group of us could go out to eat or something.

We're having a small get together Wednesday, November 15 at Champs (located
in the Uptown Park shopping center, near McCormick & Schmick at the corner
of 610 and Post Oak).  I'm sure there's a lot of us who didn't get to say
good-bye so, stop by for a drink and wish Dewey good luck in his new
adventure.

Michael has been peppering me with questions lately:

Do you have to be rich to run for president?
Do you have to follow in your father's footsteps when you grow up?
How would it be if I kicked the ball through the clouds and God caught it?
Can you see God?
Where is God?
Why did Dolly die (pathology, not philosophy)?  Was it fleas and worms?

And when he was  mad at Neil:  Mom, you picked the wrong husband.

I'm sure there have been more - this was just Sunday and Monday!

Please let me know.

Attached are my comments on the Midway Tolling term sheet and LOI.  

I will be out on Monday but will have my cell phone on.  My conversations 
will be regularly interrupted by golf strokes, but I will do my best to be 
available.

Call me if you have specific questions/issues to discuss.  I have asked Dave 
Kellermeyer to call either one of you on Monday with an answer to the minimum 
block size for the tolling term sheet.  I am taking the air permit home to 
review and will leave you a message if I determine the answer.

the turbine load factor.  In the permit application, we provided emission 
estimates for 50 to 100 percent load and termed this as the ""expected range 
of operating conditions"".  We can operate below 50 percent load, but would 
likely need to do initial stack compliance tests at the lowest load we would 
operate the plant.

Since the emission guarantees from GE will likely be for a range of 50 to 100 
percent load factors, I suggest that we adopt 50 percent load (approximately 
85 MW per turbine) as the mimimum turbine load.
