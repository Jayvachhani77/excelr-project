How will the cutover work.  If a trader, operator logins in at the new building will the 800 numbers not follow.  If so then we will bring in an extra crew at noon to login and get set up in the new building with a planned cut over around 3pm.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  excelr executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
excelr assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to excelr are not true.  Dynegy owed excelr <$50MM.  
Lay says that excelr had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at excelr, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with excelr had they not been approached by 'excelr's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in excelr's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding excelr's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the excelr's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over excelr.
excelr is planning to hold an excelr-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that excelr would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places excelr-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to excelr internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both excelr and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the excelr traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the excelr business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the excelr business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of excelr.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of excelr's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at excelr, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore excelr to its rightful place in the energy industry.

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the excelr building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

22647,baughman-d/inbox/287.,<290440.1075862597414.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Today, excelr hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.excelr.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and excelr will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=

Good Day,

Getting rid of Lotus Notes for NetCo (or whatever we will be?):
The power scheduling group and the 24 hour Power Trading group both use the ""East Power Discussion"" db in Lotus Notes.

They need a bulletin board basically that they can all write to.  They will need to have the historical information from the Lotus Notes db saved into the new format(whatever that is).

 Let me know if you have any other questions.

2. Some trading groups use Lotus Notes for business applications.

The fact that you have seen this document is to remain confidential do not share with anyone that is not included on this distribution list

The attached is a list of NETCo transition project assumptions/expectations and issues that are being worked in anticipation of Day 1 at NETCo. I want you to read through it so that:

you are aware of what we'll be expected to support on Day 1
you can read for issues that will directly impact your ability to support

any concerns/questions that you have should be directed back to me. Please let me know when you have completed reading, even if you don't find anything that raises concern

thanks!

P.S. ""Day 1"" is subjective ... means first day of business. The term ""Day 2"" means when NETCo is actually physically separated from Estate, not the literal 2nd day of ops

Subject:	New UBS Phone Number Requests


Several discussions have been circulating regarding current excelr phone numbers and the need for new toll-free numbers the UBS East Power Group.

For the UBS Power Trading group (EAST):

  We can request new toll-free numbers (24 Hour, Fax and Scheduling) as per Kathy Link (UBS Houston 5-5418).  
	a. 	Don Baughman and I have discussed a few options for these numbers, but would welcome any input or related requirements you may be 				aware of prior to us initiating this.
	b.	We will establish these for East Power ASAP.   David Steiner (503-464-3701) will be the contact to facilitate this effort for the West Desk
   	

   Our current ""853"" numbers will probably be replaced by new ""584"" numbers(Kathy Link is working on this).  If this occurs, new numbers will be assigned to us.

   Our Current ""800"" numbers for 24-Hour, ""Fax, and Scheduling can be forwarded  / transferred by the IT group to the Estate from our current phone turrets.

Let's discuss these numbers tomorrow, Tuesday morning (February 4th).

Thanks,

David, could you let me know who on your team has the right skillset to par=

Mike,

MISO announced at the Policy Subcommittee meeting yesterday that it would b=
e phasing in Day One operations pursuant to the proposal outlined below.  C=
ommercial operations would commence on the basis of MISO's ISO (rather than=
 RTO) status, although MISO anticipates that FERC will designate it an RTO =
on December 19 (this anticipation on the basis of discussions between Jim T=
orgenson and FERC at the NARUC meetings last week).  MISO foresees many que=
stions regarding implementation of the phasein, and is requesting that a wo=
rking group representing all sectors be established to work with the transm=
ission owners to accomplish the phase-in.  A conference call will be held o=
n Monday November 19 to put together the working group and organize its act=
ivities (call in number not yet distributed).  It was clear from yesterday'=
s meeting that the first efforts of the working group will be to work throu=
gh implementation issues for the December 15 actiivities; subsequent effort=
s will be dedicated to January 1 and February 1 implementation.  The outcom=
e of the working group's December 15 implementation recommendations will be=
 presented to an interim meeting of the Advisory Committee on December 5.

Two Texans were having the blue-plate special at their favorite watering
hole when they heard an awful choking sound. They turned around to see a
lady a few bar stools down turning blue from wolfing down an Armadillo
burger too fast. 
 
The first Texan said to the other, ""Think we ought to help?"" 
 
""Yep,"" said the second Texan. 
 
The first Texan got up and walked over to the lady and asked, ""Can you
breathe?"" 
 
She shook her head no. 
 
""Can you speak?"" he asked. 
 
She shook her head no again. 
 
With that, he helped her to her feet, lifted up her skirt and started to
lick her butt. She was so shocked, she coughed up the obstruction and
began to breathe, with great relief. 
 
The first Texan turned back to his friend and said, ""Funny how that Hind
Lick Maneuver works every time!""

David, as per emails last week this will be excelrs only chance to participate and provide feedback to MISO as it starts up operations.  Kerry was on the call this morning and while excelr may be able to add a member to this group it will be difficult.  If you are interested coordinate with Kerry...

Mike

Subject:	info on MISO startup conference call

Mike, here's some addtional information about the working group that was put together on this morning's conference call to work through implementation issues associated with MISO's commercial start-up.  Earlier this morning I emailed an agenda for the call and a revised commercial operation start-up plan.  

The purpose of the call was to establish a small working group to identify and resolve, from a market perspective,  the issues associated with MISO's proposed start-up plan.  The working group will be working closely with transmission owner reps who are looking at start-up implementation from a systems perspective.  The working group will have a conference call on November 26 (the purpose of the call is to identify all of the implementation issues) , and working sessions on 12/3 and 12/4 prior to a presentation to an interim meeting of the MISO Advisory Committee on issues associated with 12/15 implementation plans.  The group will meet thereafter, at times yet unspecified, to deal with implementation issues associated with 1/1 and 2/1 implementation (including for example MISO tariff administration begining 1/1 for point-to-point and possibly existing network service and beginning 2/1 for new network service requests).

Persons/entities named to the working group this morning included Richard Doying, PGE; Jim Stanton, Calpine; someone from WPPI; Bill Jett, Cinergy Trading; Greg ____ from Dynegy; Rob Martin from Wisconsin Electric; Jim Bradkowski, DTE; and Malcolm Burgess, ATC.  If someone from excelr wishes to be added, they should talk to John Caitlin of the MISO staff ASAP.  John Caitlin is also accepting emails identifying implementation issues associated with the commercial operation plan that need to be resolved.  ",Non Abusive

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as excelr employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-excelr holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for excelr to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

AEP has informed us over the past couple of nights that they MUST HAVE tag numbers in order to do next day checkouts.  They claim that this has always been the case but we know that in the past we have not needed the tag #'s in order to check out. It appears AEP enjoys being difficult.  So it looks like going forward we will need tag numbers from the schedulers in order to check our properly with AEP.

Subject: FW: Big Boy harvested


Jeff Duncan of Sanger, Texas shot the deer they call ""Big Boy"" at Hagerman
National Wildlife Refuge in Grayson County with a bow on Sunday afternoon.
His gross B&C score green score is 234 3/8, and net green score is 230
6/8.
He will be a new Texas state archery record.  The deer is believed to be
10.5 years old, at least.  He has been photographed and videoed several
times in the past, and was actually shot 2 years ago on private land, but
the arrow passed through his hindquarters, and he survived.
Congratulations
to Jeff.  The story will probably be in Sunday's Dallas Morning News.
Jeff hasn't quit smiling since Sunday.

Subject:	Implementing PJM WEST

As we have discussed on our conference calls, AP will be joining PJM WEST on
January 1, 2002.  The formation of PJM WEST will result in two Control Areas
being operated as a single market under the PJM umbrella.  As such, PJM will
become the Security Coordinator and Transmission Provider for AP.  Additionally,
AP will no longer be a valid source or sink; PJM will be the source/sink.

In order to avoid potential validation errors with the Book of Flowgate, the
following implementation strategy is proposed to transition the Book of
Flowgates and the IDC base case from their present configuration to the
configuration required for PJM WEST.


Before January 1, 2002:

Step 1)  In the Book of Flowgates, add ""PJM"" as a Control Area, Security
Coordinator and Transmission Provider to all flowgates that presently have ""AP""
listed as a Control Area.

Beginning 1/1/02, PJM will be the Security Coordinator for AP.  For system
reliability it will be necessary for PJM to have the ability to call TLRs on AP
flowgates.  Adding ""PJM"" to these flowgates provides for a smooth transition
across the changeover period of late December and early January.  This should
not cause OATI validation problems as both 'AP' and 'PJM' are entities
registered control areas


On January 1, 2002:

Tags with 'AP' as either the Source or Sink will be denied; PJM is now the valid
source/sink.


After January 1, 2002:

Step 2)  In the Book of Flowgates, remove AP flowgates from ECAR area and add
them into MAAC area.  Flowgates get new MAAC region numbers.


Step 3)  In the Book of Flowgates, remove ""AP"" as a Control Area, Security
Coordinator and Transmission Provider to all flowgates where PJM was added as
such in Step 1.


Step 4)  In the IDC base case, move the 'AP' area into the 'PJM' area.


Step 5)  In the NERC Registry, remove ""AP"" as a Control Area, Security
Coordinator and Transmission Provider.

The west has their own arrangements with OATI.  

You will not require anything for the change over to etag 1.7 in march as OATI will take care of this as part of their services.

Kevin Burns from OATI will be in Houston on Feb 13th from 1-3 to discuss UBS services required and I would recommend that you have some one sit down and review the services that you will need going foreward.

Hope this helps. 

For passwords you can contact Don for MDEA & EPMIEA and Eric has the Genco ones.

Thanks.

Lloyd,

Paul and I are meeting with Bob Hall tomorrow morning to sort out what resources we need.  What is the cost per account for these and do these include Portland requirements as well?  Also, what do we need to do for the changeover to the new scheduling system in March?  

Tom.

Corry, Don, Theresa and Tom.

I have asked OATI to reduce the number of accounts from 40 to 10 to reduce the costs for the estate.  Therefore I recommend we go down to the following accounts excelr01-10.

Please reply ASAP.

Lloyd,
I am going to attach a document that contains the 40 users for EPMIE.
Please let me know which 30 users you would like me to delete, and I will
take care of that for you.  I will also let my billing department know to
change all of the contact information on your invoices to what you have
stated below.  Do you know if these are going to be the Entity names that
you will be using for UBS AG or will they be different.  Just let me know.
If you could let me know which users you would like deleted, I will get this
taken care of for you. [May, Tom]

Lloyd,

Paul and I are meeting with Bob Hall tomorrow morning to sort out what resources we need.  What is the cost per account for these and do these include Portland requirements as well?  Also, what do we need to do for the changeover to the new scheduling system in March?  

Tom.

Corry, Don, Theresa and Tom.

I have asked OATI to reduce the number of accounts from 40 to 10 to reduce the costs for the estate.  Therefore I recommend we go down to the following accounts excelr01-10.

Please reply ASAP.

Thanks

I have contacted the DBAs and indicated your displeasure of not being informed of the proposed EnPower down-time.  They should be contacting you shortly.  However, let me ensure you that there will be no down time without your approval.  Attached is the email that I sent in response to Bill's call earlier this afternoon.  Don, I have included you in this email to keep Real-Time East ""in the loop"".

DBAs,

What exactly are your plans for this maintenance window?  I have just receive a very stern call from our Bill Williams (head of the West Desk real-time traders) whom is concerned that his team will be unable to function for 8 hours for days in a row.  He indicated that the database being down for that period of time is unacceptable.  Our real-time users work 24-7 and must meet schedules every hour.

Bill also asked that we keep the real-time desk in the loop for any potential down time.
Please include the following people on your distribution list regarding database maintenance windows.
Don Baughman (head of Real-Time East)
Bill Williams III (head of Real-Time West)
Michael Tully (IT Portland)

All scheduled down-times must be approved by both Don Baughman and Bill Williams.  This would indicate that we need to plan in advance in all cases so that they have time to approve.

Please distribute a new email discussing in more detail the state of the database during the maintenance window.

Thanks,
Will

Will/Bill/Norman,

The DBAs would like some downtime this weekend to re-build some objects that are overly-fragmented.  If we can give them 2 - 4 different 6 - 12 hour windows, they will re-build as much as they can.

Can we get together briefly this morning to determine when we could allow some downtime?  The DBAs would like to know by about 2:00 this afternoon.

22706,baughman-d/inbox/341.,<27072241.1075862599483.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Dear Investor,

About 3 weeks ago, I e-mailed you about a stock I
believe can make you filthy rich.

So far, I haven't heard back from you, and that's a
real shame.  That's because we don't get many chances
like this one -- where a small investment now can
create true wealth in just a couple short years.

Think I'm kidding?  This company just issued a small
piece of good news yesterday, and its stock POPPED
27%.  Now today, it's up another 12% at mid-day.
That's 39% GAINS in 9 1/2 trading hours!  When's the
last time you made profits like that?

Best of all, those gains are just the appetizer for
the feast to follow.  So it's not too late for you --
if you get in now.  So what's the story?  And why is
it so powerful?

Well, my friend, this company's revolutionary
communications breakthrough makes Federal Express look
like the Pony Express...and could well make you 500%
RICHER by 2003.

I'm talking of a global network to deliver documents,
data, video on-demand -- anything you can imagine --
anywhere in the world...at the SPEED OF LIGHT!  Yet the
company behind this remarkable achievement -- a GEM
rich in innovation and cash -- is priced at giveaway
prices thanks to the market meltdown.

This ISN'T some punk Internet stock struggling to stay
afloat.  The company has a $2.4 BILLION cash war chest
and a list of PAYING CLIENTS that reads like the
""who's who"" of global communications.  I've been
professionally involved in global stock markets for 30
years now, and I can honestly say I've seldom seen a
story so dramatic.

*At my California Technology Stock Letter, we jumped
on Intel in 1994, when most analysts scoffed at its
prospects.  Three years later, we sold for 575% GAINS.

*In July 1998, Power Integrations got knocked down to
silly levels, so I practically screamed at clients to,
""BUY!""  We better than tripled our money in less than
six months' time.

*DUSA Pharmaceuticals was going begging in 1998 when
we gobbled up all we could.  Our 1,316% gains turned
$25,000 into more than $350,000.

THERE ARE MORE LIKE THESE.  But they don't come around
every day.  That's why I'm pounding the table on this
one.  I'm expecting some of the EASIEST PROFITS we've
ever made.  And if you MISS OUT, you'll kick yourself
later.

I've just put the finishing touches on an URGENT
Profit Bulletin called You Can Be 500% Richer By 2003
that I'd like you to have.  It details the saga of the
#1 TOP-DOG in global communications today...explains why
this company will dominate worldwide while others
fail...and gives you hard evidence for 500% PROFITS by
2003.

And that's just to start.  There's a great shot at
TENFOLD GAINS in the next 5 years, because this
company truly controls the destiny of global
communications.

THE FUTURE OF COMMUNICATIONS IS FIBER OPTICS.  Think
of nearly unlimited bandwidth at incredibly efficient
prices.  Experience and research tells me, this is an
industry destined for greatness.    Ask yourself this:
Will we go back to rotary phones, no Internet and
scratchy long-distance calls?  Or will we go forward
to faster connections... Internet use throughout the
world...and a wide array of data, video, conferencing,
etc, services?

My friend, man simply DOESN'T go backwards.  It's
human nature to want what your neighbor has.  It's
human nature to want bigger, better and more.  That's
why I believe the communications revolution isn't
over...it's JUST GETTING STARTED.  There will be bumps,
bruises and shakeouts along the way.  But that just
allows KINGPIN companies like this one to gobble up
even more market share.

THIS COMPANY INVESTED more than $7 billion to link 27
companies with a revolutionary 100,000-mile fiber
optic network.  And in a real twist in today's world,
the project just finished on budget...on schedule.
What's more, this network isn't some empty shell -- it
has real paying customers, with contracts covering
half the cost already.

*Its customers already include major telecoms like
Deutsche Telekom, British Telecom and Qwest;
institutions like the British government and the U.S.
Navy; and companies like Proctor & Gamble, American
Express, Direct TV and JP Morgan Chase.  And the
company has already inked $1 billion worth of new
deals so far this year.

*China is becoming a huge source of profits.  The
country has pledged to spend $13 billion to improve
its infrastructure in preparation for the 2008
Olympics -- much of that for communications upgrades.
What's more, China's entry into the World Trade
Organization will trigger another spending spree.  And
this company will be one of the prime beneficiaries.
As you'll see in your free report, the China
connection is HUGE!

*This company has been on an earnings tear, prior to
the hit our entire economy  has taken this fall.
EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes, depreciation
and amortization) rose 33% in the 2nd quarter -- a
phenomenal number.  And as the economy recovers, I
expect EBITDA to return to its blistering growth pace.

*What's more, this company is set to be a big player
in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that enable SECURE
communications between groups of people anywhere in
the world.  Virtual ""face-to-face"" audio and video.
No need for airline travel.  Analysts expect this
industry to grow quickly and become huge.

THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND LOSERS in the bandwidth
game.  And I'll bet dollars to doughnuts, this company
will be the BIGGEST WINNER of all.   In today's weak
economy, the smaller outfits are teetering on the
edge.  They can't raise capital.  But in the meantime,
this JUGGERNAUT is sitting on $2.4 BILLION in cash!

I sense AMAZING OPPORTUNITY here.  But the opportunity
won't last long.  Today's confusion about the economy
has some real gems priced like baubles.  And this
stock is a GLITTERING DIAMOND just waiting for you to
scoop it up.

To get the name and full story, see You Can Be 500%
Richer By 2003.  To find out how, please GO HERE:

Yours Sincerely,
Michael Murphy
Editor, California Technology Stock Letter

P.S.  Bill Gates is one smart guy -- and Microsoft
recently inked a new deal with this company to link
all its European offices.  Why?  Because it's the only
place to turn for state-of-the-art technology and
service.  You must understand, no other firm can match
this company's technologies or global reach.  And I
don't believe we'll ever see this stock priced so low
again -- even after its 27% GAINS today.  Grab YOUR
SHARE of the profits ahead.  Click here now:

Bad-dream Shotwell,

I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day.  I
tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year, to no avail.  Just
wanted to catch up, and go drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger.

Doing fine down here in Houston.  I bought a house in League City.  In
addition, I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the
summer.  We are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship.
I am doing well at excelr, managing the real-time power trading desk and
trading.  excelr, as you have seen in the paper, is experiencing some
trouble.  We are reasonably sure we will merge with Dynegy in mid to
late 2002.  Family is doing well; my sister is about to have her second
baby.  Travis is back from his year and a half tour in Europe, and took
a position with Cemex as an account manager.  Dad is about 3/4 retired
and he and mom are doing a fair amount of hunting & fishing.  Travis & I
are gonna spend Thanksgiving in West Texas, deer hunting.

How's life in Hooterville?  I heard that you are full on retired!
FANTASTIC!  What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?
Hopefully consuming large quantities of beer & tequila and blowing you
eardrums out with Jimmy Buffett!

Tell when you are not busy and I will drive up, or have you down to the
house and the bayhouse.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Drop me a line when you have a chance!

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in excelr's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - excelr has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  excelr will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - excelr's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

The Enpower Database is in need of some routine maintenance and clean-up.  The work is designed to improve performance and expandability for the future.  We were hoping to utilize the Thanksgiving holiday to perform some of this work.  What we need from you guys is permission to have some agreed upon downtime for Enpower over the holidays so we can run some clean-up jobs on the database.  However, we do need to execute the jobs in such a way as to have a minimal impact on the Real Time trading desks.  Here is our plan as was previously discussed with David Poston:

Wed Nov 21, 8pm - 10pm Central (6pm - 8pm Portland), for unrelated hardware maintenance

Beginning Saturday thru Sunday, rolling 3 hour outages:
(NOTE:  during the below times, the system may not actually be totally down, but error messages may occur so don't be alarmed)

Starting Saturday morning at 10am (8am Portland Time) we will be contacting the East & West Real Time Desks to determine if they can afford a 3 hour down-time window.  When the clean-up job is completed, we will contact the related desks that the Enpower application is now available.  We will then want to keep the environment stable for at least an hour to allow the traders to catch up from the down-time.  We will repeat this process during the following time periods.

Saturday, November 24nd from 10am (8am Portland) - Saturday, November 24th @ 6pm (4pm Portland)
Saturday, November 24nd from 8pm (6pm Portland) - Sunday, November 25th @ 8am (6am Portland)
Sunday, November 25th from 10am (8am Portland) - Sunday, November 25th @ 6pm (4pm Portland)

Contact numbers during this maintenance are:

I have not heard any more on whether new numbers will be assigned, but I don't expect that to happen right away.  I'll let you know if I hear anything to the contrary.  Thanks!

Subject:	New UBS Phone Number Requests


Several discussions have been circulating regarding current excelr phone numbers and the need for new toll-free numbers the UBS East Power Group.

For the UBS Power Trading group (EAST):

  We can request new toll-free numbers (24 Hour, Fax and Scheduling) as per Kathy Link (UBS Houston 5-5418).  
	a. 	Don Baughman and I have discussed a few options for these numbers, but would welcome any input or related requirements you may be 				aware of prior to us initiating this.
	b.	We will establish these for East Power ASAP.   David Steiner (503-464-3701) will be the contact to facilitate this effort for the West Desk
   	

   Our current ""853"" numbers will probably be replaced by new ""584"" numbers(Kathy Link is working on this).  If this occurs, new numbers will be assigned to us.

   Our Current ""800"" numbers for 24-Hour, ""Fax, and Scheduling can be forwarded  / transferred by the IT group to the Estate from our current phone turrets.

Let's discuss these numbers tomorrow, Tuesday morning (February 4th).

Thanks,

Corry Bentley

ENDGAME IN AFGHANISTAN?

American planes kept up their attacks on the remaining TALIBAN
STRONGHOLD of Kandahar, while Kunduz seemed on the brink of surrender.
The Northern Alliance, King Mohammed Zahir Shah and Pakistan-based
Pushtuns agreed to send representatives to a UN-brokered meeting near
Bonn to discuss the structure of a transitional post-Taliban government.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34858_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_6f

Twenty-one countries met in Washington to start to plan the ECONOMIC
RECONSTRUCTION of Afghanistan. The UN said that rebuilding the country
would cost more than $25 billion over 10 years.

President George Bush, addressing troops in Kentucky, gave warnings
that the ""most difficult steps"" lay ahead: the breaking of al-Qaeda and
the capture of Osama bin Laden. The bounty for his capture was raised
to $25m.

THE SAFEST WAY TO TRAVEL

President George Bush signed a long-awaited AVIATION-SECURITY bill. As
many as 28,000 of the people who screen air passengers and their
baggage will become federal employees. The bill also calls for stronger
cockpit doors on aircraft and more armed federal marshals on flights.

An elderly woman in Connecticut died from the inhalation form of
ANTHRAX. A letter to Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont tested positive
for the disease: so did the offices of two more senators.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34856_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_6d

The United States denounced Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Libya, Syria and
Sudan for having, or seeking to acquire, BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS. The move
accompanied proposals by the Bush administration to strengthen the 1972
Biological Weapons Convention.

RASMUSSEN BEATS RASMUSSEN

DENMARK'S centre-right Liberals, led by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, won a
general election, beating the centre-left Social Democrats, led by Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen, the European Union's longest-serving prime minister.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34862_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_6a

The government of GERMANY'S chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, narrowly won
a parliamentary vote of confidence tied to his promise to send troops
abroad to help in the war against terrorism, but many of his
coalition's Greens, who have a party congress this weekend, continue to
wobble.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34861_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_69

Mr Schroder's chief foreign-policy adviser, MICHAEL STEINER, resigned
after losing his temper with a German sergeant who is said to have
failed to get him some caviare during a refuelling stopover.

An ex-Communist, Georgi Purvanov, was elected president of BULGARIA,
against the wishes of the country's prime minister, Simeon Saxe-Coburg,

In KOSOVO the more moderate ethnic-Albanian nationalists led by Ibrahim
Rugova, who is expected to become the province's president, won a
general election.

After weeks of hesitation, MACEDONIA'S parliament endorsed
constitutional amendments to give the country's ethnic-Albanian
minority more rights.

MIDDLE EAST PEACE EFFORT

Colin Powell, America's secretary of state, heralded a fresh American
effort to end ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE. Anthony Zinni, a former
commander of American forces in the Middle East, was instructed to help
negotiate a ceasefire, and to remain in the region until his mission
was accomplished.

Ninety-four suspected ISLAMIC MILITANTS went on trial before an
Egyptian military court. All were charged with belonging to a secret
organisation working against the state; the relatives of some say they
were tortured to obtain confessions.

Five GAZAN CHILDREN were killed by an unexploded Israeli tank shell on
their way to school.

Morgan Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe's opposition leader, was cleared of treason
charges, and so will run against ROBERT MUGABE in next year's
presidential election. Mr Mugabe, in his campaign against white
farmers, threatened to break up farms larger than 2,000 hectares (4,940
acres).

Daniel arap Moi, Kenya's president, strengthened his standing in the
country by appointing Uhuru Kenyatta, son of Kenya's first president
and independence hero, Joseph Kenyatta, to be a local government
minister.

SYRIA released a handful of political prisoners, some detained since
the mid-1980s, as part of a presidential amnesty. But human-rights
groups estimate that some 1,300 political dissidents are still
detained.

An official report into a $5 billion arms deal in SOUTH AFRICA found no
evidence of widespread corruption, but identified conflicts of interest
and murky goings-on.

MISS NIGERIA became the first black African to win the Miss World
beauty contest.

ARGENTINA MUDDLES ON

More trouble for ARGENTINA'S government, as it struggles to persuade
investors to accept a restructuring of its debt. Domingo Cavallo, the
economy minister, admitted that falling tax revenues meant fiscal
targets agreed with the IMF would be missed. Meanwhile, the Supreme
Court quashed charges of arms smuggling against Carlos Menem, a former
president.

A group representing VENEZUELA'S private sector called a one-day
""strike"" in protest at 49 decree-laws issued by President Hugo Chavez,
which include measures to increase royalties on oil production and
limit land ownership.

firms signed contracts to sell foodstuffs worth about $20m to CUBA.

SPIRITUAL SUPPORT

A group of 35 westerners unfurled a banner in Beijing in support of the
FALUN GONG, a spiritual movement banned in China. The demonstrators,
who came from the United States and Europe, had entered China on
tourist visas. All were deported.

China closed 17,500 INTERNET CAFES, claiming that too many people were
becoming hooked on computer games and pornographic sites. Another
28,000 Internet cafes are to be closely monitored.

The KING OF MALAYSIA, Sultan Salahuddin, died aged 75, leaving 14
children from four marriages. His successor will be chosen from one of
nine traditional rulers who take it in turns to be king.

THE GOOD OIL

Oil-industry consolidation continues, as PHILLIPS PETROLEUM and CONOCO
announced a $15 billion all-share merger. The new company, to be called
ConocoPhillips, is likely to be the sixth-biggest producer in the
world, based on revenues.

- - - - - See article: Minor majors
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34885_6659355_1_79944192_60299072_1_6f

NORMANDY MINING, of Australia, wooed by rival bids from America's
NEWMONT MINING and South Africa's ANGLOGOLD, rejected AngloGold's
all-share bid. This paves the way for a possible sweetened
counter-offer from AngloGold, the world's second-largest gold producer.

excelr'S financial turmoil worsened. But the Texan energy giant managed
to put off repayment of some debts until mid-December. excelr's shares
plunged to ten-year lows, casting greater doubt over its plans to be
taken over in a rescue bid by smaller rival DYNEGY.

Three EUROPEAN STEEL MAKERS, Aceralia, Arbed and Usinor, patched up
differences that had threatened their plans to merge, by agreeing to
reduce Usinor's stake in the combined entity. The new company will be
the world's biggest steel maker.

OPTIMISM AT LAST

The DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE has climbed by nearly 20% above its
lows on September 21st, leading some optimists to announce the
emergence of a new bull market. The index came within 23 points of the
10,000 mark before falling back.

- - - - - See article: Messages of hope?
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34884_6659355_1_79944192_60299072_1_6e

Brand names got a boost in Europe. The European Court of Justice handed
a victory to jeans maker LEVI STRAUSS when it ruled that sales of
so-called ""parallel imports"" from outside the European Union's
jurisdiction were allowed only with the consent of the trademark owner.
The decision ends Levi's three-year battle with Tesco, a British
supermarket chain, that sold cut-price Levi's jeans imported from the
United States.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34883_6659355_1_79944192_60299072_1_6d

American INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION fell for the 13th straight month, the
longest continuous decline since the second world war. Other indicators
were more optimistic: the Conference Board's index of leading
indicators rose by 0.3% in October, raising hopes that the widely
expected recession might not last long.

SCHMIDTBANK, a 170-year-old family-owned German bank, was rescued from
some decidedly modern investments by a consortium of bigger peers,
including Deutsche Bank, HVB Group, Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank.
Schmidtbank has racked up losses from Consors, an online broker, as
well as from bad loans to Germany's MITTELSTAND companies.

FRENCH CONNECTIONS

Shares in BULL, the troubled French computer company, shot up when its
chairman, Guy de Panafieu, resigned. The French government pledged
EURO100m ($88m) to the company, though the European Commission, which
is strongly opposed to state subsidies, may yet raise objections to the
plan.

The chief of BARCLAYS' French operations was questioned by magistrates
in Paris as part of an investigation into alleged money laundering
between France and Israel. Other banks under scrutiny include BRED, and
Societe Marseillaise de Credit, owned by HSBC.

The European Commission levied a EURO855m ($750) fine, the largest in
its history, against ROCHE and BASF, and six other companies, for
price-fixing in the market for vitamins. Two years ago, both companies
were fined by antitrust regulators in America, and a Roche executive
was jailed for four months.

PERCY BARNEVIK, the Swedish businessman who more or less created ABB,
the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant, is to step down as non-executive
chairman. Mr Barnevik said his departure would give the company's new
management team a clear mandate of their own.

LOVE BOATS

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES and P&O PRINCESS CRUISES, respectively the
world's second- and third-largest cruise lines, agreed to merge in a
bid to ride out the global economic storm. The deal may frustrate the
ambitions of CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES, the industry leader, which has made
previous overtures to P&O Princess in a failed attempt to expand
its European operations.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34886_6659355_1_79944192_60299072_1_70

KPN, the Dutch telecoms company, said it would issue EURO5 billion
($4.4 billion ) in shares at a 50% discount to the current price, to
help it reduce a massive debt load acquired to purchase
third-generation mobile-phone licences.

A slump in demand has cost jobs at ALCOA, the world's largest aluminium
producer, which announced plans to sack 6,500 workers around the world.
The company is forecasting a 4.7% drop in aluminium demand this year,
the worst in 20 years.

22735,baughman-d/inbox/37.,<19943008.1075840344244.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated excelr/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

22738,baughman-d/inbox/372.,<14053939.1075862600807.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Dear InvestorPlace.com Member,

I've just revealed a BRAND-NEW wireless recommendation
to my subscribers, and I'm SO excited about this
opportunity that I want to share the details with you,
too.

You see, wireless growth is simply exploding around
the world -- especially after the September 11
terrorist attacks.  Cell phone giant Nokia, for
example, has skyrocketed 41% just since October
1st...worldwide wireless traffic is projected to grow a
whopping 30% in 2001 alone...China plans to spend $151
BILLION on its telecom infrastructure by 2005...and
that's just the very BEGINNING of what lies ahead for
this monstrous market!

Quite simply, the profit potential is huge, and I want
to make sure that my subscribers -- and now you -- get
a piece of the phenomenal gains ahead.  That's why I'm
so excited about my newest recommendation.  I expect
it to leap 50% in the next 12 months ALONE, and I'm
looking for more incredible gains after that.  Let me
show you why.

First, you might not even know about this, but there
has been an INTENSE tech competition over the last
couple of years for the new digital wireless standard.
That battle is now over -- and this company has WON!
That means their proprietary technology will be used
in most 2.5G cell phones (set to be deployed early in
2002), and in practically ALL of the next generation
3G phones.  That alone is a terrific boon for this
stock...but keep reading, because this opportunity gets
EVEN BETTER.

Not only does this company get paid for every one of
its chips used in 2.5G or 3G cell phones...but it also
gets paid a license fee from every single company that
wants to sell or market a cell phone based on its
winning technology.  And I'm not talking about a
simple one-time fee either-these royalties get paid on
a QUARTERLY BASIS, for as long as the technology is
used.  One day, thanks to the strength of their
technology, I fully expect this company to get paid
for EVERY single cell phone in use!

And with projections for 1.3 billion cell phone
subscribers by 2003 and continued steady growth in the
following years, this is an absolutely EXPLOSIVE
opportunity for my stock.  This is a $42 billion
company growing an incredible 27% per year and
spending an impressive 17% of revenues on research and
development -- EXACTLY the type of commitment to
future growth that makes me so confident they will
maintain their competitive edge and DOMINATE their
market space for years to come.

I can almost guarantee that you'll be kicking yourself
for years to come if you don't buy this stock now.
DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU!  I revealed the name of
this company -- including my buy price, target price
and full profit details -- in the December issue of
Technology Investing, which just got released.

To make sure that you're on board for ALL the profits
we expect to make with this wireless dominator, all
you have to do is accept a RISK-FREE trial to
Technology Investing today.  (Just visit

you up to 4 FREE bonus reports with all of the details on
my other tech and biotech recommendations.  Plus, your
subscription will be fully covered by my 100% MONEY-

satisfied within the first 6 months, I'll refund every
single penny you've paid.  No questions asked.

Best of the Web Today - November 23, 2001
By JAMES TARANTO
Our Friends the Pakistanis  http://rediff.com/us/2001/nov/23ny8.htm

A series of reports from the Indian press reminds us of the degree to which America's Pakistani allies may have been culpable in the attacks of Sept. 11. The Indo-Asian News Service quotes an Indian intelligence official: ""According to reports based on information from the Northern Alliance, up to 300 Pakistan Army regulars could be holed up in Kunduz. There are reports that Pakistani officers of the rank of colonel are still in Kunduz,"" the last Taliban stronghold in northern Afghanistan.

Earlier, the Press Trust of India reported that  a pair of Pakistani helicopters  http://www.rediff.com/us/2001/nov/22ny7.htm  had evacuated a group of Pakistani military officers, including two brigadiers, from Kunduz. Indian intelligence officials ""said these forces were part of Pakistani army units, seconded to Taleban ranks for command and control operations,"" PTI reports, adding:

*** QUOTE ***

Defence experts in Delhi wondered how Pakistani choppers could have entered Afghan air space and landed in Kunduz with the US Air Force having tight control over the Afghan skies.

They said the operation could not have been carried out without a nod from the US.

""It has to be done with US connivance and, therefore, poses vital questions about America's aims and objectives,"" they added.

*** END QUOTE ***

According to another PTI report,  the country formerly known as Burma  http://rediff.com/news/2001/nov/23pak.htm  has ""granted sanctuary to two Pakistani nuclear scientists following a request from Islamabad."" The scientists, Suleiman Asad and Mohammad Ali Mukhtar, helped develop Pakistan's nuclear-weapons program and are suspected of having ties to the al Qaeda terrorist organization. Islamabad assured authorities in TCFKAB ""that the duo were not involved in any terrorist activity,"" PTI reports.

All this bolsters our  Tunku Varadarajan  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/tvaradarajan/?id=95001492 's observation that it would be a mistake for America to view Pakistan's dictator, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, as a true friend. He is, rather, an ally of convenience, doing Washington's bidding lest he be destroyed. At least Musharraf is smart enough to know which way the wind is blowing: The Associated Press reports Pakistan has  closed the Taliban's embassy in Islamabad  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20011123/ts/pakistan_goodbye_taliban.html , and the IANS adds that Pakistan ""is planning to open a mission in the eastern Afghanistan city of Jalalabad in a virtual recognition of the Northern Alliance.""

Our Friends the Spanish  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20011122/ts/attack_spain_extradition_dc_1.html

Spain may refuse to extradite eight suspected al Qaeda members to America, because America has the death penalty. Spain has been a democracy for barely a quarter century after more than three decades of military dictatorship, but its leaders are imbued with such a sense of moral superiority that they feel free to dictate domestic policy to the United States. Does anyone know the Spanish word for ""chutzpah""?

Somali Internet Shut Down  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1672000/1672220.stm

Somalia's only Internet service provider, the Somalia Internet Co., has been forced to shut down after appearing on the U.S. list of terrorist sponsors, the BBC reports. Barkaat, a Somali telecom company, has also been shut. Seems to us the Beeb buried the lead, though. The real news here is that Somalia even had Internet access.

Unforgettable  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2246-2001Nov22.html

Have the Taliban been taking advice from Bill Clinton's old spin doctors? The Associated Press reports from Spinboldak, Afghanistan, that ""a Taliban spokesman said the world should move on and forget about the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States."" Here's the quote, from Syed Tayyab Agha: ""You should forget the Sept. 11 attacks because now there is a new fighting against Muslims and Islam, and the international and global terrorists like America and Britain, they are killing daily our innocent people.""

In response, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz says: ""We are moving on, and I think before long the world will forget about the Taliban.""

The Taliban have got to be the most ridiculous bunch of barbarians the world has seen in a long time. Last week, recall, top Talib Mullah Mohammad Omar  vowed to destroy the U.S.  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001470 , then said he'd  leave Kandahar  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001486 . This week he decided to stay put because of a  ""prophetic dream.""  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001494  Now his underlings want us to ""forget"" an unforgettable atrocity. What can one do but laugh?

Even Sept. 11 is hardly evidence of the Taliban's fearsomeness. After all, the Taliban didn't blow up the World Trade Center; they merely rented out their country to the terrorists who did. That's enough to justify destroying the Taliban, but not enough to justify taking them seriously.

'Zoo Time'  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001530005-2001541922,00.html

The Times of London reports on the Taliban's treatment of the eight international aid workers they kidnapped:

*** QUOTE ***

Cruel games with a gun, maggoty food and regular parades of the women before their guards were part of life behind bars for the captives.

The women prisoners were a source of fascination for the jailers and their commanders. Every evening members of the Taleban Foreign Ministry, accompanied by a clutch of bearded strangers, would visit the cells and demand that the women stand by the bars. Wordlessly, they would stare at the women from head to toe. The prisoners--who were never touched or abused--called the session ""zoo time"".

The youngest of the German prisoners, Kati Jellinek, 29, was blonde and of particular interest to the Taleban. When she was arrested, five men with Kalashnikovs demanded that she pack, unpack and repack her underwear.

*** END QUOTE ***

Meanwhile, the  Associated Press  http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/11/20/gen.kabul.zoo.ap/index.html  reports Afghans don't treat actual zoo animals much better. Marijan, the lion at the Kabul zoo, has only one eye (just like Mullah Omar). Here's how it happened:

*** QUOTE ***

During the roaring '90s, after the Russians left, an Afghan guerrilla showing off for his friends jumped over the guard rail into the den and teased the lion. Marjan ate him.

The next day, the guerrilla's brother applied the Afghans' strict code of revenge. He tossed a hand grenade at the lion. Marjan, expecting food, pounced on it.

The blast put out his eye and nearly killed him.

On another black day, a different Afghan guerrilla amused himself by firing a rocket-propelled grenade at the elephant.

*** END QUOTE ***

No word whether the Taliban asked the elephant to forget about that indignity.

Nothing to Fear but Fear Itself  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/11/23/war23.xml&sSheet=/portal/2001/11/23/ixport.html

The headline of a London Telegraph piece on the standoff in Kunduz proclaims: ""US Fears Massacre of Foreign Fighters."" Sure we do. About as much as the foreign fighters feared a massacre of U.S. civilians back in September.

An Enemy Surrenders  http://www.preventafghanwar.org/

The Web site PreventAfghanWar.org, set up to urge America to surrender to terrorism, has itself surrendered:

*** QUOTE ***

This web site was intended as a place to gather and focus the opinions of American [sic] who believe that going to war with Afghanistan, in an action like Desert Storm, is not the way for the United States to respond to the destruction of the World Trade Center and the other terrorists [sic] acts of September 11, 2001.

On October 8 the military action began. Then it was not clear if this is an American verses [sic] Afghanistan war or has evolved into a coalition of countries against terrorists based in Afghanistan. The situation changed significantly by November 14, 2001.

Events have seemed to render the purpose of this web site moot. War and now the displacement of the Afghanistan government by the Northern Aliance [sic] is becoming a fact. Therefore this web site is being taken down, at least for the time being.

Our Friends the Oregonians  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/21/national/21PORT.html

We  noted on Wednesday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001498#portland  that the Portland, Ore., police department is refusing to cooperate with the U.S. Justice Department's efforts to investigate terrorism. An article in the New York Times (link requires registration) offers a clue as to the motivations of Portland's acting police chief, Andrew Kirkland:

*** QUOTE ***

Mr. Kirkland, who is black, said his own background had also played a role in his decision. ""I grew up in Detroit,"" he said, ""and I hated the police with a passion. They were always stopping and bothering me.""

*** END QUOTE ***

What kind of city would put someone who hates the police in charge of its police department? What's next, a commander in chief who loathes the military?

Stupidity Watch  http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4303746,00.html

One Humera Khan offers the following pearl of wisdom in London's Guardian:

*** QUOTE ***

While the Taliban were imposing their beliefs and reducing freedom on one side, the same can be said of the male-dominated and often misogynistic fashion industry on the other. The question of which is the more ruthless form of persuasion, the lashes of the Taliban or the multimillion-pound advertising flashes of the fashion industry, remains a moot point.

*** END QUOTE ***

'Extremist Relations'   http://www.time.com/time/asia/news/daily/0,9754,184955,00.html

The Asian edition of Time magazine carries a charming report on post-Taliban sexual liberation in Afghanistan. Najib, a 20-year-old Mazar-e-Sharif man, is waiting for his ""one true love"" to return; her family fled to Uzbekistan when the Taliban took over:

*** QUOTE ***

The pair used to meet regularly, sometimes holding hands, and once just before the Taliban came Shabnam spent the night with Najib at his home. ""She wanted to have extremist relations,"" he explains. ""But I controlled myself. I told her I was not ready. She was very upset, but then I pampered her and she began to smile again. In the end, we just embraced."" He muses over Shabnam's voracious sexual appetite. ""Women are very strange--you cannot understand them."" When they meet, Najib says, they would just look at each other and shake hands. ""Islam does not permit kissing,"" he pauses, ""but maybe I won't be so holy one day.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Less liberated are the U.S. Navy women on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, who, the  Washington Post  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A852-2001Nov21.html  reports, are complaining about a visit by six Miami Dolphins cheerleaders aimed at boosting the morale of the ship's men. ""It's good for the cheerleaders to see an aircraft carrier. But it's not good for the men,"" gripes Shenandoah Hawkesworth. ""They've been at sea for close to 65 days, and their hormones are definitely on high.""

John F. Who?  http://www.interglobal.org/weblog/archives/00000155.htm

InstaPundit.com cites fellow Web logger  Rand Simberg  http://www.interglobal.org/weblog/archives/00000155.htm 's observation that, as InstaPundit puts it, yesterday ""is the anniversary of JFK's assassination, and nobody seems to have noticed. He's right; I'd forgotten it myself. This seems to be of deep social significance."" Actually, the  Washington Post  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1206-2001Nov22.html  noticed, but it seems to have been alone.

The D.C. Police, Hard at Work  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64342-2001Nov21.html

The Washington Post's ""District Crime Watch"" column yesterday carried the following report:

*** QUOTE ***

Sixth St., 1600 block, 2:40 a.m. Nov. 5. Despite being told to stop, a man fondled a female acquaintance sleeping in a bed with him.

*** END QUOTE ***

It's good to know that even in this age of terrorism, the police in our nation's capital are as vigilant as ever about serious crime.

22744,baughman-d/inbox/379.,<32374031.1075862601154.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Dear Investor,

I'm writing to expose the biggest lie in technology
today...

...one that has individual investors completely in the
dark about an opportunity of immense proportions.  A
LOW-RISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money
by this time next year -- then make your fortune
several times over in the years to come.

I've just put the finishing touches on an Urgent
Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity
and in just a bit, I'll tell you how to get your
FREE copy.

But first, back to technology's biggest lie.  I'm
talking about the so-called ""glut"" of fiber optic
cable.  Here's the REAL story:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet
slowed down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact,
it nearly came to a grinding halt!  That means there
isn't nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into
the system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried
about this problem.  After all, this is the second
time it's happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in
Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore
our economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's
how banks and brokerages transfer funds...how
dispatchers route fleets of trucks...how many Americans
get paid through direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one
example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently
said they're 60% loaded on their network.  That
doesn't sound too bad...until you understand how these
networks operate.  You can't load a network much past
65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually CATASTROPHIC --
because the network spends so much time searching for
open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually
sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation
comes to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed
world.  Internet traffic systems currently run faster
in Australia, Europe and even South America.  That's
because we push out more data than everyone else --
but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the
needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up
fast!  Otherwise business, the economy and our
national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a
""fiber glut?""  Because  95% of all the fiber that has
ever been laid is ""dark"" -- that is, it's not
activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1
supplier of the components needed to do the job.  I'm
looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by this time
next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly
has ""ten-bagger"" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was
nearly 20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government
is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending
into the economy; interest rates are practically zero;
and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore
-- it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time
if you miss out. Get this company's name -- and full
details -- in my urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times
Richer By 2007.  It's yours FREE, simply for accepting
a 100% RISK-FREE trial subscription to my TECHNOLOGY
INVESTING advisory.

TAKE a full six months to measure the value of my
advice for yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't
make the profits you want, just cancel, and your
subscription doesn't cost you a dime.   That's reason
enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right -- and
I'm staking my reputation and my own money on this
call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At
least take a look at TECHNOLOGY INVESTING to see what
you think.  Our unusual six-month guarantee of total
satisfaction means my advisory costs you nothing if
you don't 100% approve.

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's
already UP 43% since October 1st, in recognition of
this company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is
strained to the limits.  And get this -- data traffic is
DOUBLING every year now.  That means a network
running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the
fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be lit.

Should we give this to our husbands???

                           CAKE or BED?

         A FOOTBALL GAME  WHEN HIS WIFE
         INTERRUPTS, ""HONEY, COULD YOU FIX THE
         LIGHT IN THE  HALLWAY?
         IT'S BEEN FLICKERING FOR WEEKS NOW,""
         HE LOOKS AT HER AND SAYS
         ANGRILY; ""FIX THE LIGHT? NOW?
         DOES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE A GE LOGO
         PRINTED ON  MY FOREHEAD? I DON'T THINK SO!""
         THE WIFE ASKS, ""WELL THEN, COULD YOU FIX
         THE FRIDGE  DOOR? IT WON'T CLOSE RIGHT.""
         TO WHICH HE REPLIED, ""FIX THE FRIDGE DOOR?
         DOES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE
         WESTINGHOUSE WRITTEN ON MY FOREHEAD? I
         DON'T THINK SO.""
         ""FINE,"" SHE SAYS ""THEN YOU COULD AT
         LEAST  FIX THE STEPS TO THE FRONT
         DOOR? THEY'RE ABOUT TO BREAK,""
         ""I'M NOT A DAMN CARPENTER AND I DON'T
          WANT TO FIX STEPS,"" HE SAYS. ""DOES
          IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE ACE HARDWARE WRITTEN
          ON MY FOREHEAD? I DON'T THINK
          SO. I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU. I'M GOING TO
          THE BAR !!!""
          SO HE GOES TO THE BAR AND DRINKS FOR A
          COUPLE OF HOURS. HE STARTS TO FEEL
          GUILTY ABOUT HOW HE TREATED HIS WIFE,
          AND DECIDES TO GO HOME AND HELP OUT.
          AS HE WALKS INTO THE HOUSE HE NOTICES
          THE STEPS ARE ALREADY FIXED. AS HE
          ENTERS THE HOUSE, HE SEES THE HALL LIGHT
          IS WORKING. AS HE GOES TO GET
          A BEER, HE NOTICES THE FRIDGE DOOR IS
          FIXED.
          'HONEY,"" HE ASKS, ""HOW'D ALL THIS GET
          FIXED?""
          SHE SAID,
          ""WELL, WHEN YOU LEFT I SAT OUTSIDE
          AND CRIED. JUST THEN A NICE
          YOUNG MAN ASKED ME WHAT WAS WRONG,
          AND I TOLD HIM. HE OFFERED TO DO ALL THE
          REPAIRS, AND ALL I HAD TO DO
         WAS EITHER GO TO BED WITH HIM OR BAKE A
          CAKE.""
          HE SAID, ""SO WHAT KIND OF CAKE DID YOU
          BAKE HIM?""

          SHE REPLIED, ""HELLOOOOO.......DO YOU SEE
         BETTY CROCKER WRITTEN ON MY FOREHEAD?
         I DON'T THINK SO!""

Hello Everyone,
 
Well, I looked around again for another inexpensive  ski trip for us to take this year.  The path has seemed to lead the same  direction as it did last year.  Lake Tahoe is by far the cheapest  package deal I can find.  I have already spoken to most of you who went  last year and everyone seems to agree it was a good time and great  atmosphere.  The dates for this adventure are leaving the evening of  January 30th (Wed.) and returning on Febuary 3rd (Sun.).
 
The vacation package is through Southwest Airlines  Vacations.
 
We will stay at the Horizon Casino for 4  nights.
 
We will depart:
Houston Hobby Airport @ 4:50 pm with a short stop  in Las Vegas and arrive into Reno at 9:20 pm.  We will then go by Charter  bus to Lake Tahoe.
 
Leaving Lake Tahoe:
Our plane will depart Reno at 12:10 pm on direct  route to Houston arriving at 6:50 pm.
 
And you ask how much for all this  excitement?
 
This can be all yours for 359.75 per person.   This price is for two people per room.  I will need to know who would like  to go no later than Wednesday  afternoon so I can set up reservations.  These  trips are booking fast.  We will be able to do like last year.  I will  call in the reservations and then each individual person will be able to call  Southwest directly and bill the trip to their own credit card.  The only  other expenses to be prepaid are for ski lift tickets and roundtrip transfer  from the airport to the hotel and back.  This cost is $30.  I figure  we will discuss the lift ticket options.  Some people may want to  Snowmobile a day or do something else.  We will discuss these options  further after the trip is set.
 
Hope to see everyone there.  The snow is  looking good up there so far.  They had 24"" on the mountain  yesterday.
 
Mason is going.  I just don't have his e-mail  address but he said to count him in.

I have been working with several different folks here and at the MISO to ensure that we are ready to do business with the MISO and request service.  The MISO OASIS seems to be accepting our Tradewave Certs, so we just need to get our MISO login for their systems. Today, the MISO will be sending out logins to their systems via FedEx, and should arrive prior to 10am.  Christi Nicolay will be receiving this information and distributing it as soon as it arrives. 

Unfortunately, the MISO has been (as you probably know) cutting things closer and closer to the edge.  This login was supposed to be delivered a couple weeks ago, but they have just gotten around to sending it out.  Hopefully, we will not have any problems with it once it arrives.  As I understand it, there should be only one login set up for ""EPMI 24-Hour Operations,"" with a login of ""excelr.""  The password is currently only known by the MISO, but should be contained in the letter we receive tomorrow.

This login is a temporary one until we complete our final registration.  This final registration has been a bit more of a pain, as it has involved contractual agreements and credit obligations.  I am still working with our Legal, Credit, and AP folks to get everything set up.  Again, the MISO sent the final documents out fairly recently, and we have not had a great amount of time to review, analyze, and negotiate their terms.  Hopefully, we will have come to agreement with MISO about those items, and be able to file that final application soon.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach me at my desk (X53771) or via my cellular (713-927-4680).  Obviously, you can also call Christi (X37007) or Susan Lindberg (X30596) as well.

Dale,

I checked the following directories you requested in our meeting today.  See my notes below:

M:\Electric\Genco			All of the Genco files must stay with the estate
M:\Electric\NERC Reports		Rika Imai will move over to UBS
M:\Electric\Transmission		Rika Imai will move over to UBS
M:\eServices\Genco			All of the Genco files must stay with the estate
M:\Electric\MidMarket\Transmission Info 
M:\Electric\MidMarket\Transmission Studies	

The two tranmission folders in the MidMarkets directory are not ours.  We will not need them however, you may want to take a quick look to see if your organization will need the information.  

Please let me know if you need me to check others for you.  

Thanks.

Several discussions have been circulating regarding current excelr phone numbers and the need for new toll-free numbers the UBS East Power Group.

For the UBS Power Trading group (EAST):

  We can request new toll-free numbers (24 Hour, Fax and Scheduling) as per Kathy Link (UBS Houston 5-5418).  
	a. 	Don Baughman and I have discussed a few options for these numbers, but would welcome any input or related requirements you may be 				aware of prior to us initiating this.
	b.	We will establish these for East Power ASAP.   David Steiner (503-464-3701) will be the contact to facilitate this effort for the West Desk
   	

   Our current ""853"" numbers will probably be replaced by new ""584"" numbers(Kathy Link is working on this).  If this occurs, new numbers will be assigned to us.

   Our Current ""800"" numbers for 24-Hour, ""Fax, and Scheduling can be forwarded  / transferred by the IT group to the Estate from our current phone turrets.

Let's discuss these numbers tomorrow, Tuesday morning (February 4th).

Thanks,

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence.

The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes excelr will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The excelr Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of excelr's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, excelr has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, excelr's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of excelr to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to excelr and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, excelr has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of excelr's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support excelr by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

Since FERC did not act on our September 11, 2001, PJM West compliance filing
(Docket No. RT01-98-000) at its December 19th meeting, Allegheny Power (AP)
will need to delay the start of the PJM West arrangement until March 1,
2002.  In order to accommodate the further delay in the start date, AP will
need to sell transmission service under the AP OATT and on the AP OASIS for
the month of February 2002.  To accomplish this, AP will do the following:

*	AP will attempt to call the Transmission Customers that have
""confirmed"" point-to-point transmission service reservations on the PJM
OASIS for the paths that are not currently valid for PJM (AEP and DLCO) by
4:30 p.m. on December 21 to determine if they need comparable service on the
AP system.  If that is the case, AP will honor the ""confirmed"" reservations
and the PJM OASIS timestamps.
*	Yearly service that was not given the option to exercise roll-over
rights on the PJM paths (AP to PJM and PJM to AP) will be given the option
to extend that service through the month of February.  AP will attempt to
call these Transmission Customers by 4:30 p.m. on December 21.
*	ATCs for the month of February will be uploaded to the AP OASIS
starting at 8 a.m. on December 24.  The upload will include all valid AP
paths (AEP, PJM, VAP, FE and DLCO).
*	Transmission Marketing will post a message on the OASIS when the ATC
upload is started and when it is complete.
*	Transmission service beyond March 1, 2002, will continue to be sold
by PJM per the Interim Coordination Agreement that was filed with FERC on
February 12, 2001.
*	January 30, 2002, is the last scheduled FERC meeting in January.
If FERC does not act on our filing at that time, the start of the PJM West
arrangement may then be delayed until April 1, 2002.  Further information
will be provided at that time, if necessary.


AP regrets any inconvenience that this delay may have caused you.  AP will
continue to keep you up-to-date on the implementation of PJM West.  AP has
requested that FERC issue an effective date of the first day of the calendar
month which begins at least thirty days after the date on which FERC issues
an order.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please call me
at (724) 838-6748 or the Transmission Marketers at (724) 838-6064.

Bribe and Groom
During the wedding rehearsal, the groom approached the pastor with an
unusual offer:
""Look, I'll give you $100 if you'll change the wedding vows. When you get to
the part where I'm supposed to promise to 'love, honor and obey' and 'be
faithful to her forever,' I'd appreciate it if you'd just leave that out.""
He passed the minister a $100 bill and walked away satisfied. On the day of
the wedding, when it came time for the groom's vows, the pastor looked the
young man in the eye and said:
""Will you promise to prostrate yourself before her, obey her every command
and wish, serve her breakfast in bed every morning of your life, and swear
eternally before God and your lovely wife that you will not ever even look
at another woman, as long as you both shall live?""
The groom gulped and looked around, and said in a tiny voice, ""Yes,"" then
leaned toward the pastor and hissed: ""I thought we had a deal.""
The pastor put a $100 bill into the groom's hand and whispered: ""She made me
a better offer.""

They are gathering an extended set of information (including the items on the current matrix) on their top 25 exposures.

Chris said that the 26th exposure was about $10MM and one would need to get to about the 50th exposure to get below $1MM.  I asked him to forward down whatever they had completed to date so we could get educated and keep a central file.  He is also going to forward a call in number for a conference call tomorrow so we can begin to get educated on the current effort.

Lorraine Becker (ext. 31680) will be handling travel arrangements.  Please forward your credit card # so she can complete the reservations.  
(P.S. Piper is getting verification from Bowen regarding travel expenditures.)

There is a pretty large group of us going to the  Firehouse for New Year's eve this year.  Most of the people that attended  the Christmas party and most of the people who went to Schroeder Hall last  year.  Anyway just wanted to spread the word to a few of you who may not  have gotten the word.  Tickets are $25 apiece and probably need to be  purchased before the end of next week.  Roger thinks it will sell out  before Christmas.  Hope everyone has a great day.  Joe if you would  like for us to buy you a ticket let me know.
 
Thanks

Peggy Zahler has had her light wires cut twice.  It is not the time taken to

>We reget to inform you that, effective immediately, Santa Claus will no
>longer be able to serve the Southern United States on Christmas Eve. Due to
>the overwhelming current population of the earth, his contract was
>renegotiated by North American Fairies and Elves Local 210, and he now
>serves only certain areas of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and
>Michigan.
>
>As part of the new and better contract, Santa will also get longer breaks
>for milk and cookies, so keep that in mind. Your children will not be
>ignored on Christmas Eve - they will be in the good hands of your local
>replacement, Santa's second cousin, Bubba Claus. His side of the family is
>from the South Pole. He shares Santa's goal of delivering toys to all the
>good boys and girls, however, you may notice a few differences in the
>service. For example:
>
>1. There is no danger of a Grinch stealing your presents from Bubba Claus.
>He has a gun rack on his sleigh and a bumper sticker that reads ""These toys
>insured by Smith and Wesson.""
>
>2. Instead of milk and cookies, Bubba Claus prefers that children leave an
>RC cola and pork rinds or a moon pie on the fireplace. And Bubba doesn't
>smoke a pipe, though he dips a little snuff, so please have an empty spit
>can handy.
>
>3. Bubba Claus' sleigh is pulled by floppy-eared flyin' coon dogs instead
>of reindeer. Reindeer were once mistakenly issued to Bubba Claus, who now
>has a couple more nice trophy heads over his fireplace.
>
>4. You won't hear ""On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen ..."" when
>Bubba Claus arrives. Instead, you'll hear, ""On Ernhardt, on Wallace, on
>Martin and Petty....""
>
>5. ""Ho, ho, ho!"" will be replaced by ""Yee-haw!"" And you also are likely to
>hear Bubba's elves respond in unison, ""I hear'd dat!""
>
>6. As required by Southern highway laws, Bubba Claus' sleigh does have a
>Yosemite Sam safety triangle on the back with the words ""Back Off."" He also
>has a few other decorations on his sleigh back as well, such as a string of
>flashing Christmas lights around the license plate, and a caricature of
>Santa Claus going wee-wee on the Tooth Fairy.
>
>7. The usual Christmas movie classics such as ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and
>""It's a Wonderful Life"" will not be shown in your negotiated viewing area.
>Instead, you'll see ""Boss Hogg Saves Christmas"" and ""Smokey and the Bandit
>V"" featuring Burt Reynolds as Bubba Claus and dozens of state patrol cars
>crashing into each other.
>
>8. Bubba Claus doesn't wear a belt. You should make sure that the wife and
>the kids turn the other way when he bends over to put presents under the
>tree.
>
>9. And finally, Christmas songs about Santa Claus, such as ""Rudolph The
>Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" will be replaced on
>all AM radio stations in the South by your new official Christmas carol,
>""Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.""
>
>YEE-HAW!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!

should be back in operation by Tuesday, January 1. There is a (small)
possibility that problems may arise and delay availability.

This is especially important to Authorized Account Representatives of
accounts in the NOx Allowance Tracking System (NATS), since December 31 is
the NOx Budget Program (NBP) allowance transfer deadline. December 31 is the
last day that a transfer of allowances, of 1999 through 2001 vintage, can be
recorded via the On-Line Allowance Transfer System (OATS). It is also the
last day for mailing a hardcopy Allowance Transfer form for NBP 2001 Annual
Reconciliation purposes.

Please do not wait until the last minute to do on-line allowance transfers!!
Should any problem arise in accessing OATS, please make sure to mail a
hardcopy NBP Allowance Transfer form by midnight, December 31.

Please feel free to contact me at (202) 564-9157 if you have any questions
or problems.

 [IMAGE]    INVESTMENT  SUMMARY    HYPD is a premier provider of comprehens=
ive integrated technology services (ITSP) and solutions for   a client base=
 in the rapidly growing ITSP marketplace for small-to-medium sized business=
es.    HYPD is capable of handling a wide range of its clients? unique ITSP=
 needs, with services ranging from conventional IT services to enterprise m=
igration and comprehensive IT HyperSource solutions (outsourcing all of a c=
lient?s e-business needs).  HYPD has positioned its future business strateg=
y around the development of uniquely designed Integrated Technology Centers=
 (ITCs), which will offer client companies comprehensive bundled ITSP servi=
ces and solutions integrated with its state of the art facilities.  The fir=
st Houston based ITC has recently begun operations, and is offering its cli=
ents a full and expansive range of outsourced IT and back-office services. =
HYPD?s first ITC is designed around an AT&T Dedicated Entrance Facility wit=
h on-net redundant fiber provisioning offering scalable bandwidth up to an =
OC-48 and beyond.  Th! is comprehensive Tier-1 hosting center enables HYPD =
to offer clients complete end-to-end IT services in a fully redundant and s=
eamless environment.  Through recently developed Hyperserve connection prod=
ucts, HYPD has been able to improve the functionality of its services by of=
fering clients remote server appliances that connect to the ITC.  Bolstered=
 by strategic alliances and strong working relationships with major players=
 in technology and telecommunications, including Microsoft, Intel, AT&T, an=
d Great Plains, HYPD has demonstrated a superior ability to cater to the un=
ique needs and limitations of small-to-medium sized businesses, effectively=
 creating a business model that partners HYPDS? success with that of its cl=
ients.  Utilizing this innovative approach, HYPD should be able to grow its=
 business in conjunction with client business growth, and position itself a=
s the ITSP provider of choice for an emerging market of small and mi! d siz=
ed companies.  Within the Houston region, and with this small and mid sized=
 target market, HYPD is well positioned to grow its business substantially =
over the near to intermediate term and achieve niche market dominance withi=
n an appreciable time period.     HYPD has recently aimed its full-service =
IT hosting business model towards the unique needs and growth strategies of=
 small to medium-sized businesses, a rapidly growing market that is relativ=
ely undeserved by major IT service providers such as Level 3, UUNet, and Sp=
rint.    HYPD has based this approach around the potentially lucrative, lon=
g-term revenue streams afforded through association with growing companies.=
  For example, HYPD has recently initiated long-term Hypersource IT hosting=
 arrangements with Eagle Wireless International and Premiere Media Group.  =
Eagle Wireless is a leading supplier of broadband wired and wireless equipm=
ent and services for a variety of markets, including the Internet, digital =
set-top boxes, and wireless convergence products, and is anticipated to rea=
ch national market penetration within the next several years.  As the clien=
t company grows its business over the next several years, the highly scalab=
le nature of the Hyperdynamics? IT hosting model will enable the Company to=
 offer additional needed services readily while retaining high margins.  By=
 being able to refine and scale! up client IT services in a quick time peri=
od, and for minimal additional expenses, HYPD has opened up access to signi=
ficant and recurring long-term revenue streams from smaller and mid-sized b=
usiness clients.  Moreover, HYPD offers client companies an unprecedented d=
egree of personalized attention and customization, when compared to major n=
ational ITSP providers.      The infrastructure of HYPD?S first ITC, design=
ed to support end-to-end ITSP services can also be leveraged for easy and s=
mart diversification. With its recent acquisition of Seacon Computer System=
s, Inc. (SCS), HYPD has been able to enter the vertical seismic data manage=
ment market. Thus, in addition to its horizontal industry approach for ITSP=
 services, new and innovative vertically oriented business opportunities of=
fering diversified revenue streams are coming to HYPD.    For example, SCS =
is a seismic data management company that has developed a unique and cost s=
aving method for transferring seismic and geologic data for oil and gas com=
panies on 8mm and 9mm magnetic tapes to state of the art DVD (optical) stor=
age.  The current methods of storing this type of data on magnetic tapes ar=
e time consuming, prohibitively expensive, outdated (the technology is over=
 40 years old), and inefficient.  SCS will enable clients in the expanding =
oil and gas industry to migrate the estimated 3 billion magnetic tapes that=
 degrade in 8-20 years to DVD storage, with an expected lifespan of over 50=
 years, at a cheaper price point and with easy accessibility.  The SCS acqu=
isition, moreover, provides an ideal strategic fit to the core data center =
business of HYPD, and opens up significant and highly lucrative revenue str=
eams.  SCS will derive revenue! s from three principal sources: (1) convers=
ion of existing tapes to superior DVD storage technologies; (2) accessing D=
VD data through HYPD?s ITC facility; and (3) a vertical ASP approach to rem=
ote seismic interpretation processing of data through the Houston ITC using=
 technical and hardware support from Intel.  In addition to opening up an i=
nnovative and new business through the SCS acquisition, HYPD believes that =
it will be able to apply this type of vertical ASP approach towards other t=
arget industries, such as insurance services, either through additional acq=
uisitions or joint ventures.      HYPD?s projected revenue and business gro=
wth will be largely driven by several principal catalysts, including: (1) c=
ontinuing to implement its full service IT hosting solution, Hypersource, t=
hrough the Houston-based, state-of-the-art Integrated Technology Center and=
 future planned ITC?s in regional markets; (2) orienting its ITSP solutions=
 and services towards the unique needs of expanding small-and-medium sized =
businesses; (3) entering into long-term, recurring revenue contracts by gro=
wing with its clients, and providing additional services at higher margins =
as these client businesses expand; (4) opening up new and lucrat! ive reven=
ue streams through its subsidiary SCS, and integrating this business opport=
unity through internal synergies with its core IT hosting and services busi=
ness; and (5) positioning itself within a competitively underserved marketp=
lace for ITSP services and products for small and mid-sized business client=
s.      VALUATION   Consolidation within the ITSP industry has been a consi=
stent theme within the past several years.  Major ITSP hosting players have=
 been acquired in a series of recognizable transactions.  Notable among the=
se has been the acquisition of Verio by NTT, and the acquisition of Digex b=
y WorldCom.  Within the remaining players in the IT hosting industry, remai=
ning players have been devastated by the decline in valuations accorded, ba=
sed on consistently increasing earnings deficits and increased cost of serv=
ices provided.  In addition, these players have suffered due to aggressive =
acquisition strategies undertaken during the previous two years that have n=
ot proven out as significant growth catalysts and increased debt structures=
.  By contrast, HYPD has pursued a conservative growth strategy with limite=
d acquisitions carefully calculated to directly and immediately benefit agg=
regate revenues and earnings.  Relative to comparative companies within the=
 ITSP industry, HYPD could realize superior growth in business and earnings=
 over the near-to-intermediate term period.  A grouping of comparable compa=
nies within this sector currently trades at an average price to sales multi=
ple of 2.70 X.  On a forward looking basis, using FY 2003 revenue and earni=
ngs estimates for the Company (fiscal year 2003 starts July 1,2002), this r=
epresents roughly a 8-fold premium to current trading levels.  Thus, when a=
pplying the comparative grouping?s average price to earnings and price to r=
evenue multiples to HYPD we can arrive at a relative valuation of $4.30 per=
 share over the next 12 months.         SUMMARY   Aggressive investors look=
ing for above-average return potential on a portion of their investment cap=
ital should give HYPD a serious look.  Management of the Company, headed by=
 CEO Kent Watts, are highly talented and educated in their technical areas.=
  We believe HYPD has assembled an astute, goal oriented, sophisticated tea=
m committed to HYPD becoming very, very successful.  Investors at current l=
evels may be rewarded in the short term, and beyond, as HYPD?S business pla=
n is executed.  HYPD may very well be one of the stock market?s best secret=

Blanc du Bois is all harvested and in the tanks.  We had a great turnout for the harvest!  Everyone had fun and we finished before noon.  Raymond is doing his thing as a  winemaker.  We harvested 4,800  pounds.  We are also going to  purchase additional Blanc du Bois from Fort Bend, Austin and Anderson Counties.  So Haak Winery will have plenty of Blanc du Bois this year.  This will be l00% Texas Wine.  Will let you know when it is  bottled.  This is the vintage that  Michael Lonsford (Wine Critic from the Chronicle) gave a 4 Star rating.  This years' Blanc du Bois will be even  better.
 
Friday, July 13, from 6:30 till we are having Johnny &  Mel perform for a TGIF party on the Patio.   John Martin played with the Evertones in the 60's and Mel Douglas has  played with the likes of-The Platters, The Drifters, Jackie Wilson, Johnny Cash,  Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins.   He recorded many singles over the years, including ""Statue of A Fool"",  ""Blue Water"", ""Hurricane Carla"" and ""Pounding Heart"".  After work on Friday afternoon stop by  the winery and enjoy Johnny & Mel with the Blues, Country, Oldies (You name  it) we'll have plenty of snacks and wine.   Bring your lawn chairs.
 
July 29, 200l 6:30 till 8:30 PM JAZZ IN THE VINES with ""l0  Forward"".  Relax with your lawn  chairs and enjoy this, third in our summer series, jazz concert.  The Deli will be stocked.

The number is 281 534-2531.  With all of the standing water, we already have
a problem with the large swamp mosquitos.

To highlight tonight's meeting, there were discussions about coming up with
an emergency plan for our neighborhood.  One item suggested was a list of
available resources for our neighborhood, both from government and from
neighbors (boats, generators, pumps, fans, etc.) and another was coming up
with a synopsis of what happened to the neighborhood last week.  I will
forward information to you on these things as I receive them.  There were
many concerns voiced and a lot of good suggestions.  We will meet in July to
have a formal neighborhood meeting.

Another upcoming event will be a Clear Creek Environmental Foundation
clean-up.  They plan to start at Clear Creek Village and work up the creek.

This meeting took place on very short notice and many people could not attend
due to cleaning up their homes.  The board members are trying to talk with
all of the homewoners who had damage.  You may call or email any of the board
memebers if you have concerns or you may email me and I will gladly forward
your emails.

The email list now has about 100 addresses.  That meants that about 108 homes
do not get this information.  Please talk with your neighbors and make sure
that they are aware of the information you receive.  This sure is faster than
door to door flyers, but it is limited in its scope and readership.

that affect Clear Creek Village.

Donald H. Olsen, Constable Precinct 8 visited out meeting tonight.  He
reminded us to close our garage doors and lock them, especially when we leave
during the day.  He also reminded us that school will be out soon and we all
need to watch the neighborhood.

City Council candidates Thomas Cones and Barbara Meeks were at tonight's
meeting and we would like to thank them for their time and interest in
meeting with the residents of Clear Creek Village.

 City council member Katie Benoit was also in attendance.  She spoke to us
about a possible $80,000 grant from the state that would pay for the 54 acres
along Clear Creek at the back of Clear Creek Village, that we call the land
at the end of Audubon and Williamsport.  It might be possible that this land
could be turned into a city park.  That could mean that the land would become
a wildlife area again rather than a development of homes.  Ms. Benoit asked
that we contact Rhonda Cyrus at the City of League City (281-332-3431) to
tell them about the wildlife in that area.  What roosts there?  What have you
not seen since the clearing?  Can you tell us about the birds and ducks that
are there in the winter?  They will be requesting that citizens submit
information until early June.  Did you realize that Clear Creek is on the top
ten list of endangered rivers in the US?  Do you have any comments or
concerns?  Let you CCV Board members know.  Be aware that this is an issue
that we need to consider carefully.

Remember, there is a CCISD meeting Tuesday night to consider your homestead
exemption.  CCV will have a group there to ask questions and give opinions.

There is a meeting on May 4 to consider the Corps of Engineers flood plans
for Clear Creek.  I will send you more on that later.

fill the unfilled Board positions.  Congratulations.  Thanks to all of you
who voted.

NEWS from CPSC

U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission


Office of Information and Public Affairs	Washington, DC 20207


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE	?
March 3, 1983	?
Release # 83-008	

Commission Closes Investigation Of FPE Circuit Breakers And Provides Safety 
Information For Consumers

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced today 
that it is closing its two year investigation into Federal Pacific Electric 
Stab-lok type residential circuit breakers. This action was taken because the 
data currently available to the Commission does not establish that the 
circuit breakers serious risk of injury to consumers.

The Commission investigation into Federal Pacific Electric (FPE) circuit 
breakers began in June, 1980, when Reliance Electric Co., a subsidiary of 
Exxon Corporation and the parent to FPE, reported to the Commission that many 
FPE circuit breakers did not fully comply with Underwriters Laboratories, 
Inc. (UL) requirements. Commission testing confirmed that these breakers fail 
certain UL calibration test requirements. The Commission investigation 
focused primarily on 2 pole residential circuit breakers manufactured before 
Reliance acquired FPE in 1979.

To meet UL standards, residential circuit breakers must pass a number of 
so-called ""calibration tests."" The purpose of these tests is to determine 
whether the circuit breakers will hold the  current for which they are rated 
and also automatically open or  ""trip"" (shut off the current) within 
specified time limits if over-loading of the circuit causes current levels in 
excess of the breaker's amperage rating. (Overloading can occur because a 
consumer plugs too many products into a circuit or due to the failure of a 
product or component connected to that circuit). While the Commission is 
concerned about the failure of these FPE breakers to meet UL calibration 
requirements, the Commission is unable at this time to link these failures to 
the development of a hazardous situation.

According to Reliance, failures of these FPE breakers to comply with certain 
UL calibration requirements do not create a hazard in the household 
environment. It is Reliance's position that FPE breakers will trip reliably 
at most overload levels unless the breakers have been operated in a 
repetitive, abusive manner that should not occur during residential use. 
Reliance maintains that, at those few overload levels where FPE breakers may 
fail to trip under realistic use conditions, currents will be too low to 
generate hazardous temperatures in household wiring. Reliance believes its 
position in this regard is supported by test data that it provided to the 
Commission.

The Commission staff believes that it currently has insufficient data to 
accept or refute Reliance's position.

The Commission staff estimates that it would cost several million dollars to 
gather the data necessary to assess fully whether those circuit breakers 
which are installed in homes but which may fail UL calibration tests present 
a risk to the public. Based on the Commission's limited budget ($34 million 
for fiscal year 1983), the known hazards the Commission has identified and 
must address (involving products of other manufacturers) and the uncertainty 
of the results of such a costly investigation, the Commission has decided not 
to commit further resources to its investigation of FPE's circuit breakers. 
However, despite its decision to close this particular investigation, the 
Commission will continue its investigation of circuit breakers generally. The 
Commission can reopen its investigation of FPE circuit breakers if further 
information warrants.

The Commission advises consumers to take certain safety precautions with all 
circuit breakers and fuses. Consumers should:

Know your electrical circuit. Know which outlets and products are connected 
to each circuit.


Never overload any electrical circuit by connecting too many products to the 
circuit. Be particularly careful not to connect several products that demand 
high current (such as heating appliances) to a low amperage circuit.


Comply with local building codes in wiring or adding electrical circuits. 
Make sure the wiring and devices used in the circuit are connected to a 
circuit breaker or fuse of the proper size.


Immediately disconnect any electrical product if problems develop. Have the 
product examined by a competent repair person.


Investigate to determine why a fuse blows or circuit breaker  trips. Do not 
simply replace the fuse or reset the breaker. If a fuse blows or breaker 
trips, it is often a warning that the circuit is overloaded. Check the 
circuit for causes of overloading (for example, too many appliances plugged 
in, a malfunctioning product, a short circuit). When in doubt, consult a 
licensed electrician.

Consumers who have questions concerning circuit breakers, or who wish to 
report information relating to their safety, may call the U.S. Consumer 
Product Safety Commission's toll-free safety hotline at 800-638-CPSC, 
teletypewriter for the hearing impaired at 800-638-8270 (Maryland only 
800-492-8104).
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from 
unreasonable risk of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer products 
under the agency's jurisdiction.  To report a dangerous product or a 
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's fax-on-demand service, 
call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800)

The guides provide the dog, decoys, blinds, transportation, and they call them in for you.  They will let you call if you want, but the guides are top notch.

My uncle and I are thinking of going down this weekend or the next.  Let me know if you are interested, and we will reserve you a spot with us.

Don, it was great talking to you about hunting and shooting today.  Below is the link to Central Flyway Outfitters (CFO).  They are a top notch guide service out of Winnie, Texas (near Beaumont) that specialize in duck and goose hunting.  They have hunting packages around $150 a gun (they offer corporate discounts as well).  All you need is a license, shells, gun, and waders:  they will take care of the transportation (4 wheelers), guide, and dog.  

I am heading down there tomorrow for a hunt with my uncle.  I will let you know how we do.  If you are interested I can arrange hunt on a future Saturday or Sunday morning.  Regards, Lyle

Tuesday, April 10, 2001 ? ?

 
 

Dear continental.com customer,



We're Changing To Serve You Better
This Thursday evening April 12th 2001, we are launching a new version of our 
web reservations system, eService Online.  This marks the start of an 
exciting new beginning as the reservations platform is 100% provided by 
Continental.

We're making this change because our current product, while good, will not 
provide us with the flexibility in the future to offer the features that will 
make travel arranging easier and to tailor the online Continental experience 
for you.


Here's What You Need To Know:

Your Profile
Your profile information, including your username (dbaughm) and password, has 
been transferred to the new version of eService Online.  To protect your 
personal information, credit card information has not been transferred.  You 
will need to update your profile.

Your Itineraries
Information on your reservations created before April 12th will not be saved. 
If you want to keep a copy for your records, you will need to print them 
prior to 9pm/CDT April 12th.  This change does not affect the status of any 
previous reservations and tickets, but you can not view them in the new 
eService Online.  

Signing In
To enhance security, you will have to sign in for each transaction session to 
reserve and purchase flights.  This means you will have to use your password 
each time.  To have your password e-mailed to you click here.  You are 
strongly encouraged to sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging 
process. 

24 Hour Hold Option
To prepare for this Thursday's release we will be turning off the ""Hold for 
24 hours"" option.  The ""Hold"" option will not be available between April 10 
and April 12.


Here Are Some of the Changes

More eTicketing
The new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets 
(eTickets).  We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by 
Northwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West 
Airlines (CO2000-2349). 

Aircraft Seat Maps
We rearranged the seat map pages for easier viewing. We also enhanced the 
seat selection process and enabled Elite-status available seating. 

Pricing 
The pricing system is enhanced to deliver more current fares based on your 
selection of either ""Search By Lowest Fares"" or ""Search By Schedule.""  We 
also added a gold star to denote ""continental.com promotional fares,"" so you 
know for certain when you receive a discounted, online-only airfare. 

Customer Service 
Our customer service is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now 
handle all support for online inquiries and reservations services. 

While we've made a number of improvements to the overall experience, this new 
version may not, on the surface, appear to offer significant benefits.  These 
changes lay the foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for 
the future.  We welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  
Based on feedback from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.

Overall, we're confident that you will appreciate the changes and 
improvements and look forward to continuing to serve you in the future.

Sincerely,
Continental Airlines Inc.


This is a one-time update e-mail.  You have been sent this e-mail as a 
registered eService Online user to inform you of this change in service.

   1. Introduction

   So, who the heck is LoneStarMusic.com? Well, as it says
   on our home page, we're the ""True Sound of Texas."" Of
   course, one man's true might be another man's trouble.

   So, what do we think true some Texan sounds are? Hmmm . . .
   acoustic guitars. Steel guitars. Townes Van Zandt's blues.
   Kelly Willis' voice. The Brothers Robison and the Sisters
   Damnation. Electric lounges, armadillos, and Do-Wacka-Do.
   Texas tornados. Broken spokes. Pat Green, Gruene Hall,

   2. Mission Statement

   LoneStarMusic.com wants to provide an outlet for independent,
   roots-aware Texas musicians. (As for what those roots are,
   please reference previous section). Texas has produced a
   striking amount of great, original music, and only a corporate
   behemoth can cover all of that real estate. I think we're doing
   our part, though, attempting to represent smaller artists - like
   ourselves - who are trying to get a handle on the many
   elemental influences that tug on you when you live in Texas.
   That's why we're not standing still. LoneStarMusic.com wants
   to become a full resource for Texas music. We want to provide
   information, sounds, graphics, books, and anything else that
   might help us musically navigate the ought-oughts. The future
   will include an expanded version of what Texas music is and
   who it has influenced. For now, please honor the words of
   Bob Wills ... and stay a little longer.

   6. Interview With A Craftsman - Guy Clark
      Introduction by Sunny Sweeney

   Born and raised in West Texas, Guy Clark has always stayed
   true to his Lone Star roots when it comes to songwriting.
   In this rare interview, Chad Raney, President of Lonestarmusic.com,
   gets the chance to chat with the Godfather of Texas Songwriting.
   Clark talks about his personal inspirations and shares his
   secrets to writing songs. Everyone who is anyone in Texas music
   today has been inspired in some way by this writing genius and
   musical trendsetter. Clark talks about his friendships with
   Townes Van Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle and Verlon Thompson
   and reveals how his wife's brutal honesty has helped him write
   many of his amazing songs.

   7. Artist of the Month - The Groobees

   The Groobees are a Texas music band in just about every sense of
   the term as well as the words within it. First of all, they are
   one of those musical units that is genuinely a band. One can hear
   the interplay and feel the unity in the melodies and grooves they
   create together. When it comes to being musical, The Groobees not
   only offer a vast range of instrumental accents, lacing accordion,
   mandolin, and banjo over guitars(both electric and acoustic),
   keyboards, bass, and drums, but create songs that carry stories,
   imagery, emotions, and meaning in the lyrics along with giving
   each player the room to shine. And while they may not sing about
   such overworked Lone Star State subjects as beer, dancehalls, and
   two-stepping, The Groobees do reflect the breadth and depth of the
   music found in Texas, flavoring their songs with elements of rock,
   country, folk, pop, blues, and more. And getting back to just how
   much The Groobees are a genuine band, that fact is also revealed
   in how all that they do comes out sounding like nobody else but
   The Groobees.

   1. Artist of the Month - Ray Wylie Hubbard
      Written by Richard Skanse

  The guitar had seen better days when Ray Wylie Hubbard happened
  upon it. It was an old Regal -- far from a top of the line brand
  even its day -- but surely it deserved better than this: reduced
  to a planter in the back corner of a little store somewhere in
  Arkansas. ""They had plants in it,"" Hubbard laughs, ""because the
  whole bottom part of it was curled up and gone because it'd been
  washed away in a flood."" Nonetheless, Hubbard thought it was
  pretty neat, and when the shop owner asked him if wanted it,
  he said yeah. The owner shipped it to Hubbard, who with the help
  of a friend brought the instrument back to life.

  ""I'll be amazed if the thing's not incredible,"" marvels Hubbard
  over the phone from his log cabin home in Wimberley.  ""Regals were
  kind of the bottom end of guitars back then, pretty cheap, but it's
  funky -- it's real warm and it's got a great neck on it. It had to
  have belonged to a blind musician, because on the neck there are
  these notches on the third, fifth, seventh and ninth fret, and the
  only thing we could figure out was that if you were blind that way
  you would know what fret you were on. I'm getting ready to paint the
  top of it black and put a rose decal on it, and then it will be done.""

  Hubbard is a man who knows a thing or two about remarkable
  resurrections. After a wild run through the heyday of the Austin-based
  progressive country movement of the Seventies, during which time he
  penned the immortal outlaw anthem, ""Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother""
  and performed at the front of a reckless outfit dubbed the Cowboy
  Twinkies, Hubbard hit the brakes at the beginning of the Eighties
  and spent eight years re-evaluating not only his career but more
  importantly, his life. Inspired by Stevie Ray Vaughan's successful
  eradication of his drug and alcohol addictions, Hubbard followed suit
  and returned in 1992 with the independently released Lost Train of
  Thought. The excellent Loco Gringo's Lament came two years later,
  with the increasingly sophisticated and poetic Dangerous Spirits,
  a cracklin' live album, and 1999's devilishly good Crusades of the
  Restless Nights following in short order. His winning streak continues
  this month with the release of the Gurf Morlix-produced Eternal and
  Lowdown, a gritty, bluesy collection of songs that plays like an
  aural map down the rough and tumble road to redemption and second
  chances. In another life, not too long ago, Hubbard might have been
  written off as a one-hit-wonder. Albums like Eternal and Lowdown
  prove otherwise, marking him as a Texas songwriter on the order of
  Townes Van Zandt and Butch Hancock. You better believe Hubbard belongs
  in that company -- every bit as much as that funky old Regal guitar
  deserved to be rescued an ignoble retirement and thrust back to work
  in the hands of a serious song poet.

   4. Honorary ""Lone Stars"" - Jason Boland And The Stragglers

   ""That's right. You're not from Texas, but Texas wants you anyway.""
                                                       - Lyle Lovett

   Well, the ""Boys From Oklahoma"" do it again. This time its the Stragglers
   with their new release ""Truckstop Diaries""

   The CD starts off with the title cut which gets its name from the
   eclectic mixture of folk that are seen at your average roadside
   attraction. Far from a just a collection of trucker tunes, the CD
   ranges from country, honkytonk, roots rock, bluegrass, spanish,
   and gospel. Take a listen for yourself and get ""Behind The Music""
   with our audio webcast including Boland's commentary on the new CD along
   with song samples.

22892,baughman-d/personal/internet/7.,<23935034.1075840345575.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"The Changes described below in your Account Agreement will apply to
any existing balances as well as new Purchases, Cash Advances and
Balance Transfers and become effective with your Billing Cycle that
ends on or after 8/1/01. These terms and conditions will be in
effect as long as your Account has a balance.

General
This NextCard(R) Account Agreement and Disclosure Statement
(""Agreement"") contains the terms and conditions which govern your
NextCard Visa(R) (or MasterCard(R)) Account (""Account"") which is
issued by NextBank, N.A., Phoenix, AZ.
	This Agreement includes this document and the terms provided in
the Supplemental Disclosure enclosed with this document and the
card carrier accompanying your Card, and any amendments thereto.
The Supplemental Disclosure includes your Account Annual Percentage
Rates. Please read this Agreement carefully, including the section
on Finance Charges, and keep it for your records.
	In this Agreement, the word ""Card"" means the credit card(s) issued
to you. The words ""you,"" ""your"" and ""yours"" refer to each person
who has been approved for this Account. The words ""we,"" ""our"" or
""us"" refer to NextBank, N.A., or its assignees. In addition, the
words ""Transaction Date"" refer to the date the goods or services
were purchased or the date the Cash Advance was made. The words
""Posting Date"" refer to the date that the charge was debited and/or
credited to your Account.
	By applying for this Account, you agree to the terms and
conditions provided in this Agreement, including the Supplemental
Disclosure. You agree to sign your Card as soon as you receive
it.

Liability
	You become bound by this Agreement when you use your Card or
Account. You are also bound by this Agreement for the use of your
Card or Account number by any person who has been given authority
by you to use your Card or Account number. If you authorize another
person to use your Card, such authority will extend until such time
as we have retrieved the Card or you have received the Card back.


Using Your Card and Account
	You may use your Card to purchase goods or services wherever your
Card is honored; you may also use your Account to initiate the
transfer of balances from other credit cards to your Account.
NextCard reserves the right, however, to refuse transactions
initiated by other credit card issuers or merchants at our
discretion.  You may obtain Cash Advances on your Card from
financial institutions and automated teller machines that accept
your Card. In addition, you may use Convenience Checks that we may
provide to you from time to time. These checks may not be used to
make payments on this or any other account with us.  Your Card and
Account may only be used for valid and lawful purposes. You may use
your Account for Balance Transfers, by which you pay off other
credit card outstanding balances. Balance Transfers may include
initial and promotional offers.	We have no responsibility for any
refusal to honor your Card or the Convenience Checks we provide,
nor for the retention of your Card by any financial institution or
merchant.

Promise to Pay
	You promise to pay the total amount of the Purchases, Cash
Advances and Balance Transfers made with your Card or Account. You
also promise to pay any Finance Charges or other charges described
herein; and any costs incurred by us in enforcing this Agreement,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs. ""Attorneys'
fees"" includes the cost to us of the services of our in-house
counsel.  If you close your account, you must notify us in writing
and must still pay all amounts you owe us and will be responsible
for any charges that you authorized prior to closing your account.
If there is a membership fee for your account, the fee will
continue to be charged, as permitted by law, until the account
balance has been paid in full.

Personal Identification Number
	After your Account is opened, we may issue you a Personal
Identification Number (""PIN"") which you may use with your Card to
obtain Cash Advances on your Account at any automated teller
machine in any system or network of which we are a member, or to
make purchases at any designated point of sale machine. You may use
your Card and PIN at an automated teller machine to obtain Cash
Advances of up to $300 per day, up to your available Credit Limit
for Cash Advances. There will be no charge for the issuance of a
PIN. (Other banks' automated teller machines may have lower Cash
Advance limits or may assess surcharges.)

Statements
	You can access your Account information and Statements online. In
addition, we will send or deliver to you a Statement at the end of
each billing period (intervals of approximately one month called
""Billing Cycles"") if there is a debit or credit balance on your
Account of $1 or more, or a balance on which a Finance Charge has
been assessed. Upon your request or approval, we may deliver your
statement electronically.

Payment
	All payments must be made in U.S. Dollars and delivered, or mailed
to us at the address shown on your Statement. Payments by check
must be drawn on a U.S. bank. Due to processing requirements, any
payment we receive after 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time will be considered
received the following business day.  You must pay at least the
Minimum Payment Due shown on your Statement by the Payment Due Date
- approximately 20 to 25 days after the Statement Closing Date - to
avoid delinquency. If your payment is more than the Minimum Payment
Due, it will be treated as a single payment and none of it will be
applied to future Minimum Payments Due. We may apply payments to
amounts owing on your Account at our sole discretion and are not
required to do so in a manner that reduces the Finance Charges you
must pay. Payments may also be made via the NextCard online bill
payment system. For details on using the NextCard online bill
payment feature, please go to My.NextCard.com.
	For information regarding your Minimum Payment Due each month, see
the Supplemental Disclosure to this Account Agreement.

Credit Limit
	The total amount of Cash Advances (including drafts, if available,
withdrawals from ATMs, originations from the Card itself, and
cash-like transactions, including but not limited to, wire
transfers, money orders, foreign currency, lottery tickets, funds
used for wagers or gambling, and money transfers using certain
internet payment systems, and this includes all transactions
identified to us as having been made by a merchant or service
provider in such categories) you can receive at any time is shown
on your monthly statements and is designated as your ""Total Credit
Limit for Cash Advances"". You agree not to permit your unpaid Cash
Advance balance to exceed this limit. If you currently exceed, or
once you reach this limit, you will not be eligible for additional
Cash Advances until your unpaid Cash Advance balance is below this
limit. At this time, you may access the amount of the difference
between your unpaid Cash Advance balance and your Cash Advance
Credit Limit.  We may change your Cash Advance Credit Limit at any
time, and we will notify you of any such change. We reserve the
right to delay increasing your available credit for up to 14 days
if we consider it necessary to verify payments received on your
Account.  This change will not affect how promptly payments are
posted to your Account for purposes of determining Finance Charges,
late fees or delinquency.

FINANCE CHARGES
	The types of Finance Charges that may be assessed on your Account
are as follows:  Periodic Finance Charges; Transaction Finance
Charges; Annual Membership Fee Finance Charges; Rewards Fee Finance
Charges; and PictureCard Fee Finance Charges. Your total Finance
Charge each Billing Cycle is the sum of each type of Finance
Charges.
	We calculate Periodic Finance Charges separately for Purchases,
Cash Advances and Balance Transfers. To determine the Periodic
Finance Charge, we apply the Daily Periodic Rates for Purchases,
Cash Advances and Balance Transfers to the daily balance of
Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance Transfers. The sum of these
daily calculations for each day in the Billing Cycle is the total
Periodic Finance Charge for the Billing Cycle. The Daily Periodic
Rates for your Account are the corresponding Annual Percentage
Rates that currently may apply divided by 365.
	To determine your daily balance of Purchases, Cash Advances and
Balance Transfers we start with the outstanding balance at the
beginning of the day including any Periodic Finance Charges
calculated on the previous day's balance, add any new Purchases,
Cash Advances and Balance Transfers or other debits for the day and
then subtract any payments or credits applied to Purchases, Cash
Advances and Balance Transfers that day. This gives us the separate
daily balances for Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance
Transfers.
	Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance Transfers are included in
your daily balances as of either the transaction date or the
beginning of the Billing Cycle in which they are posted to your
Account, whichever is later.
	Periodic Finance Charges for Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance
Transfers for a day are added to the daily balances of Purchases,
Cash Advances and Balance Transfers at the end of the day and
included in the beginning balances for the next day.
Other Charges, Annual Membership Fee Finance Charges, Rewards Fee
Finance Charges and PictureCard Fee Finance Charges are added to
the daily balance of Purchases when posted. Transaction Finance
Charges are added to the daily balance of Cash Advances when
posted.
	For each Cash Advance transaction, including but not limited to,
each Cash Advance obtained through a financial institution or ATM,
or each cash-like transaction, such as the purchase of wire
transfers, money orders, travelers checks, lottery tickets, funds
used for wagers or gambling, and money transfers using internet
payment systems, and this includes all transactions identified to
us as having been made by a merchant or service provider in such
categories, we may assess a Transaction Finance Charge equal to 3%
of the amount of the advance, but not less than $5.00.  A
Transaction Finance Charge is included in the calculation of the
Annual Percentage Rate shown on your Statement; therefore, for any
Billing Cycle in which you have drawn a Cash Advance or used a
Convenience Check, the Annual Percentage Rate that will appear on
your Statement may be higher than the Annual Percentage Rate
described in the disclosures provided to you.
	NextCard offers optional Rewards Programs and an optional
PictureCardSM Program. Refer to the Supplemental Disclosure for
details regarding these programs.
	In any Billing Cycle in which there is a Finance Charge, the
minimum Finance Charge will be $1.00.

Grace Period
	Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance Transfers accrue Periodic
Finance Charges from the date they are included in your Daily
Balance until paid. However, Periodic Finance Charges are not
assessed in a Billing Cycle on Purchases if you paid in full the
New Balance, if any, shown on your previous statement by the
Payment Due Date shown on that statement or if that New Balance was
a zero or credit balance.

Other Charges
	Your Account also has the following other fees and charges (""Other
Charges""):
	There may be an Annual Fee on your Account. Refer to the
Supplemental Disclosure for details regarding the Annual Fee.
	Late Fee: We will add a fee in the amount shown in the
Supplemental Disclosure to this Agreement to the balance on your
Account for each Billing Cycle you fail to make the Minimum Payment
Due by the Payment Due Date.
	Overlimit Fee: We will add a fee in the amount shown in the
Supplemental Disclosure to this Agreement to the balance on your
Account any time you exceed your Total Credit Limit during a
Billing Cycle.
	Returned Payment Fee: You agree to pay $29.00 for each check,
draft or automatic payment (""Payment Order"") issued by you as a
payment on your Account which fails to clear and is returned
unsatisfied by your financial institution. We may post this charge
to your Account even if we re-present your Payment Order, and even
if the Payment Order is paid upon re-presentment.
	Document Retrieval Fee: If a copy of any statement, sales draft or
similar document is provided by us at your request (except in
connection with a billing error inquiry or dispute), we may charge
$5.00 for each document copy and a research fee of $15 per hour if
extensive investigation is required.

Authorized Users
	You may request and, at our discretion, we may provide an
additional Card on this Account for use by an individual you
authorize (""Authorized User""). You may also make a single request
for a new Card (""Replacement Card"") for you or an Authorized User
on this Account. In addition, we may periodically send you
substitute Card(s) for your use. Cards issued in any of these ways
are not subject to service charges. However, if you have previously
requested a single Replacement Card, we may charge a Card
Replacement Fee of $15 for any additional Card(s) you request.

Default and Immediate Payment
	You will be in default and we can require immediate payment of all
amounts you owe if:  you provide inaccurate or incomplete
information when you apply for your Account or thereafter; you fail
to make the Minimum Payment Due on your Account by the Payment Due
Date; your balance amount exceeds your Credit Limit; your
outstanding Cash Advance Balance exceeds your Cash Advance Credit
Limit, if applicable; you fail to pay your other debts or
obligations; you fail to abide by any term or condition of this
Agreement; we believe, in good faith, that you may not be able to
meet the obligations of this Agreement; or, upon your death. If you
are in default or we have reason to doubt your creditworthiness
(for example, you have a returned payment for any reason) we may,
without notice or demand for payment, terminate your right to
obtain any additional credit.  You also agree to notify us promptly
upon any change in name, address (including phone number), employer
(including phone number), or email.

Termination
	We may suspend or terminate your rights to obtain credit at any
time for any reason. Your obligations under this Agreement will
continue even after your rights to obtain credit have been
suspended or terminated.

Not Secured Credit
	Your Account is not secured credit. We have no security interest
in any transaction you make with this Card, regardless of any other
agreement you may have with us.

Foreign Currencies
	Depending on whether your Card is a Visa or MasterCard, if you
charge a transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction will be
converted into a U.S. dollar amount by Visa or MasterCard based on
their operating procedures and regulations. Generally, currency
conversions are made using either a government-mandated rate or
wholesale market rate in effect one day prior to the Processing
Date, increased by an adjustment factor established from time to
time by Visa or MasterCard. We increase this currency conversion
rate by 2%. The currency conversion rate in effect on the
Processing Date may differ from the rate in effect on the
Transaction Date or the Posting Date. Additionally, for any Card
transaction which occurs (regardless of where you initiate the
transaction) in U.S. dollars outside the United States, we will add
a fee of 2% of the amount of the transaction, but not less than
$3.00.

Unauthorized Use
	You must contact us immediately at 1-877-744-4417 (from overseas,
you may call us at 1-918-497-1629) if your Card is lost or stolen
or if you suspect unauthorized use of your Account. We may
investigate any cases of unauthorized use of your Card or Account.
If you report or we suspect unauthorized use of your Card or
Account, we may suspend your credit privileges until we resolve the
problem to our satisfaction or issue you a new Card.
	You agree to sign each Card upon receipt. You agree to safeguard
the Card, your PIN, which provides access to automated teller
machines, and Password, which provides Internet access, from theft.
You agree to keep your PIN and Password confidential and separate
from your Card.
	If an unauthorized transaction occurs on your Account or your
Account number is obtained over the Internet and subsequently used
for unauthorized transactions, you will not be liable for those
transactions.

If You Close Your Account
	You can close your Account by notifying us in writing at NextCard,
P.O. Box 60610, Phoenix, AZ 85082-0610.  If you close your Account,
you must still pay all amounts you owe us and you will be
responsible for any charges that you authorized.  You must destroy
all Cards and all Convenience Checks, cancel all preauthorized
billing arrangements and cease using your Account.  Refer to the
Supplemental Disclosure for details regarding the Annual Percentage
Rate on the remaining amount you owe.

Updating Your Account Information
	From time to time, we may obtain updated credit information from a
credit reporting agency. You are hereby notified that a negative
credit report reflecting on your credit record may be submitted to
a credit reporting agency if you fail to fulfill the terms of your
credit obligation. If you believe we have reported inaccurate
information about you to a credit bureau, please notify us at the
address appearing on your statement.
	We may share information regarding our experiences or transactions
with you or your Account with others, including merchants and
companies affiliated with us by common control or ownership (our
""Affiliates""). We may also share additional information regarding
you or your Account (such as information from credit reporting
agencies) with our Affiliates. You can request that we do not
furnish to our Affiliates information that does not relate to our
experiences or transactions with you or your Account by calling us
at 1-888-974-2265. You can also request that we do not share
information about you for marketing purposes with unaffiliated
parties by contacting us at 1-888-974-2265.

Amendments and Assignments
	After we provide you any notice required by law, we may change any
part of this Agreement and add, remove or alter requirements. IF A
CHANGE IS MADE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AGREE THAT, FROM THE
EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CHANGE, THE NEW TERMS, INCLUDING ANY NEW OR
INCREASED Finance Charges, WILL APPLY BOTH TO ANY NEW CHARGES TO
YOUR ACCOUNT AND TO YOUR ENTIRE OUTSTANDING BALANCE, INCLUDING
ITEMS POSTED TO YOUR ACCOUNT BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGE.
We also reserve the right to review your creditworthiness from time
to time, including your performance with other creditors, and to
change the terms of your Account based on that review. You agree
that we may assign your Account and any amounts that you owe us to
another entity or person at any time, with or without notice to
you.

Dispute Resolution
	IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ THIS ENTIRE SECTION CAREFULLY.  THIS
SECTION PROVIDES FOR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES THROUGH FINAL AND
BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A
COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY OR THROUGH A CLASS ACTION.

The Dispute Resolution Provision will become effective for disputes
which are not part of a lawsuit 45 calendar days after the
Statement Date on the enclosed billing statement (the 65th day if
you live in Iowa*, the 95th day if you live in Wisconsin, or the
130th day if you live in Texas), unless we receive prior to then a
letter from you stating that you do not want the Dispute Resolution
provision to become part of the Agreement.  The letter must be
addressed to NextCard, P.O. Box 60610, Phoenix, AZ 85082-0610.  It
must contain your name, address and your Account number. It must be
signed by you.  If we receive such a letter on time, the Dispute
Resolution provision will not become part of the Agreement, and the
status of your Account will be unaffected by your rejection of the
Dispute Resolution provision.

*SPECIAL NOTICE FOR IOWA RESIDENTS:  The Dispute Resolution
Provision
will only become effective for disputes which are not part of a
lawsuit if you use your Account at least sixty five(65)calendar
days after the Statement Date on the enclosed billing statement.""


THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION SET FORTH IN YOUR ACCOUNT
AGREEMENT MAY SUBSTANTIALLY LIMIT OR AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS.  PLEASE
READ IT CAREFULLY AND KEEP IT FOR YOUR RECORDS.

*SPECIAL NOTICE FOR IOWA RESIDENTS:  The Dispute Resolution
Provision will only become effective if you use your Account at
least sixty five (65)calendar days after the Statement Date on the
enclosed billing statement.""


BINDING ARBITRATION.  Arbitration is a method of deciding disputes
outside the court system.  This Provision governs when and how any
disputes you and we may have will be arbitrated instead of decided
in court.  The arbitration process established by this section is
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (""FAA"") (9 U.S.C. Sections
1 and following).  You have the right to take any dispute that
qualifies to small claims court rather than to arbitration.  All
other disputes (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
misrepresentation or any other legal or equitable theory) arising
out of or related to this Agreement, including  events leading up
to you becoming an Account holder and disputes about whether this
Provision is valid or binding or about whether or when the
Provision applies and disputes about wrongful acts of every kind,
must be resolved by final and binding arbitration.  This includes
any dispute based on any product, service, or advertising having a
connection with this Agreement and any dispute not finally resolved
by a small claims court.

The arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator using the
procedures described in this Provision.  The arbitration of any
dispute involving $10,000 or less shall be conducted in accordance
with the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association (""AAA""), as modified by this Agreement, which are in
effect on the date a dispute is submitted to the AAA.  The AAA's
Commercial Arbitration Rules and fee schedules will apply to any
disputes in excess of $10,000.  The arbitrator shall not apply
federal, state, or local rules of procedure and evidence or state
or local laws concerning arbitration proceedings.  The arbitrator
must follow the FAA, the substantive law, statutes of limitations
and claims of privilege recognized at law.  You have the right to
be represented by counsel in an arbitration.  In making an award,
the arbitrator shall be bound by and strictly enforce the terms of
this Agreement and may not limit, expand, or otherwise modify its
terms.  The arbitrator shall be a lawyer with more than ten years
experience or a retired or former judge.  Our address for service
of process under this Provision is NextCard, P.O. Box 60610,
Phoenix, AZ 85082-0610.

NO DISPUTE MAY BE JOINED WITH ANOTHER LAWSUIT, OR IN AN ARBITRATION
WITH A DISPUTE OF ANY OTHER PERSON, OR RESOLVED ON A CLASS OR
REPRESENTATIVE (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL) BASIS.  THE
ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD DAMAGES THAT ARE NOT EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED
BY THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT AWARD PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR ATTORNEYS'
FEES UNLESS SUCH DAMAGES ARE EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED BY A STATUTE.
YOU AND NEXTCARD BOTH WAIVE ANY CLAIMS FOR AN AWARD OF DAMAGES THAT
ARE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

ARBITRATION PROCEDURES.  Before you take disputes to arbitration or
small claims court, you must first contact our customer account
representatives at the number on your account statement or write to
us at NextCard, P.O. Box 60610, Phoenix, AZ 85082-0610 and give us
an opportunity to resolve the dispute.  Similarly, before NextCard
takes a dispute to arbitration, we must first attempt to resolve it
by contacting you.  If the dispute cannot be satisfactorily
resolved within sixty days from the date you or NextCard is
notified by the other of the dispute, then either party may contact
the AAA in writing at 335 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017 and
request arbitration of the dispute.  Information about the
arbitration process and the AAA's Arbitration Rules and its fees
are available from the AAA on the internet at www.adr.org.

The arbitration will be based only on the written submission of the
parties and the documents submitted to the AAA relating to the
dispute, unless either party requests that the arbitration be
conducted using the AAA's telephonic, on-line or in-person
procedures.  Additional charges may apply for these procedures.
Any in-person arbitration will be conducted at a location that the
AAA selects in the state of your primary residence.  A party who
has asserted a dispute in a lawsuit may still elect arbitration for
any part or all of the dispute that is asserted in the lawsuit.
All doubts about whether to arbitrate all or any part of a dispute
shall be resolved in favor of arbitration.  The arbitrator shall
apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and
provide written reasoned findings of fact and conclusions of law.
The arbitrator's award shall not be subject to appeal except as
permitted by the FAA.  Judgment on the award may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction.  Any arbitration shall remain
confidential.  Neither you nor NextCard may disclose the existence,
content, or results of any arbitration or award, except as may be
required by law, or to confirm or enforce an award.

ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
MUST BE BROUGHT WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER THE DATE THE BASIS FOR THE
CLAIM OR DISPUTE FIRST ARISES.

FEES AND EXPENSES OF ARBITRATION.  You must pay the applicable AAA
filing fee when you submit your written request for arbitration to
the AAA.  The AAA's filing fee and administrative expenses for a
document arbitration will be allocated according to the AAA's
Rules.  On any dispute you file, you will pay at least $50 of the
filing fee.  If you cannot afford to pay the fees charged by the
AAA and the arbitrator or if you believe that such fees are too
high, we will consider any reasonable written request by you to pay
the fees.  If you elect an arbitration process other than a
document (or ""desk"") arbitration, you must pay your allocated share
of any higher administrative fees and costs for the process you
select.  We will pay any fees or expenses we are required to pay by
law.  Each party must bear the expense of that party's attorneys,
experts and witnesses, regardless of who wins the arbitration,
except to the extent that applicable law or the AAA's Rules provide
otherwise.  The prevailing party, however, may seek to recover
AAA's fees and the expenses of the arbitrator from the other party.


MISCELLANEOUS.  This arbitration Provision shall survive any
suspension or termination of your Account, as well as the repayment
of all amounts borrowed under this Agreement.  If there is any
conflict or inconsistency between this Provision and the AAA's
Rules or other Provisions of this Agreement, this Provision will
govern.  If any portion of this Dispute Resolution is determined to
be unenforceable, the remainder shall, nevertheless, remain
enforceable.

Governing Law
	This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Arizona and
by any applicable federal laws no matter where you live. You agree
that any litigation brought by you against us regarding this
Account or this Agreement shall be brought in a state or federal
court located in the State of Arizona. If any part of this
Agreement is found to be invalid, the rest remains effective.

General Information
	No delay or failure in enforcing our rights under this Agreement
will prejudice any of our rights hereunder. If you default, unless
prohibited by applicable law, we may require you to pay all
collection costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court
costs. Our failure to exercise any of our rights when you default
or exercise other of our rights does not mean that we are unable to
exercise those rights upon later default or otherwise.

Payments Marked ""Paid In Full""
	We may accept letters, checks or other types of payments showing
""payment in full"" or using other language to indicate satisfaction
of your debt, without waiving any of our rights to receive full
payment under this Agreement. Satisfaction of your debt for less
than the full amount requires a written agreement, signed by one of
our authorized employees.


YOUR BILLING RIGHTS:  KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE

This notice contains important information about your rights and
our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.

Notify Us in Cases of Billing Errors or Questions about Your
Statement. If you think your Statement is wrong, or you need more
information about a transaction on your Statement, write us at:
P.O. Box 62648, Phoenix, AZ  85082-9962

Write us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than
60 days after we sent you the first Statement on which the error or
problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not
preserve your rights. In your letter, give us the following
information:

*Your name and account number.

*The dollar amount of the suspected error.

*Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there
is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you
are not sure about.

If you have authorized us to pay your credit card bill
automatically from your savings or checking account, you can stop
the payment on any amount you think is wrong. To stop the payment
your letter must reach us three business days before the automatic
payment is scheduled to occur.

Your Rights and Our Responsibilities after We Receive Your Written
Notice. We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we
have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either
correct the error or explain why we believe your Statement was
correct.
	After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount
you question, or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill
you for the amount you question, including Finance Charges, and we
can apply any unpaid amount against your Credit Limit. You do not
have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but
you are still obligated to pay the parts of your Statement that are
not in question.
	If we find that we made a mistake on your Statement, you will not
have to pay any Finance Charges related to the questioned amount.
If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay Finance Charges,
and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned
amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount
you owe and the date that it is due.
	If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report
you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you
and you write to us within ten days telling us that you still
refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a
question about your Statement. And, we must tell you the name of
anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to
that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is.
	If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50
of the questioned amount, even if your Statement was correct.

Special Rule for Credit Card Purchases. If you have a problem with
the quality of property or services that you purchased with your
Card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with
the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining
amount due on the property or services. There are two limitations
on this right:

*You must have made the purchase in your home state or, if not
within your home state, within 100 miles of your current mailing
address; and

*The purchase price must have been more than $50.

These limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant,
or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or
services.




Important Notice Regarding Your NextCard Account

Effective with your Billing Cycle dated after August 15, 2001, your
NextCard Account Agreement is being amended to include the
following changes to your Terms and Conditions outlined below.

The Annual Percentage Rate for Purchases and Balance Transfers is a
variable rate equal to the Prime Rate plus a margin of 15.99%, but
in any event, not less than 22.99% (Daily Periodic Rate of
0.06298%), or Prime Rate plus a margin of 16.99% for Delinquent
Accounts, but in any event, not less than 23.99% (Daily Periodic
Rate of 0.06573%), Prime Rate plus a margin of 20.99% for
Derogatory Accounts, but in any event, not less than 27.99% (Daily
Periodic Rate of 0.07668%), and a fixed rate of 29.99% (Daily
Periodic Rate of 0.08216%) for Seriously Delinquent Accounts. The
APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers after you close your
Account is variable rate equal to the maximum of Prime Rate plus a
margin of 12.99% or your Annual Percentage Rate for Purchases and
Balance Transfer,  but in any event, not less than 19.99% (Daily
Periodic Rate of 0.05476%). For a ""Cured"" Account, the APR for
Purchases and Balance Transfers is a variable rate equal to the
Prime Rate plus a margin of 15.99%, but in any event, not less than
22.99% (Daily Periodic Rate of 0.06298%). These variable rates were
in effect on June 1, 2001.

The Annual Percentage Rate for Cash Advance is a variable rate
equal to the maximum of the Prime Rate plus a margin of 17.99% or
your Annual Percentage Rate for Purchases and Balance Transfer, but
in any event, not less than 24.99% (Daily Periodic Rate of
0.06846%).

In this Supplemental Disclosure Statement the term ""Prime Rate"", as
used for any Billing Cycle, is the highest Prime Rate published in
the Money Rate Tables of The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition)
on the first business day of the calendar month in which the
Billing Cycle ends.  Changes in the Prime Rate will take effect on
the first day of your Billing Cycle. If the Prime Rate increases,
so will the Daily Periodic Rate, your Periodic Finance Charges, and
your Annual Percentage Rate. If more than one Prime Rate is
published, the highest Prime Rate will be used for this
calculation. If The Wall Street Journal (Western Edition) fails to
publish the Prime Rate for the relevant date, we will use the Prime
Rate published in The New York Times or any other newspaper of
national circulation selected by us. The Prime Rate is merely a
reference rate and may not be the lowest rate available.

The Daily Periodic Rates used in determining Finance Charges and
corresponding APR may change each month as the Prime Rate changes.
Any increase or decrease in your Daily Periodic Rates will apply to
both the outstanding balance of your Account and new charges. The
Daily Periodic Rates will continue to vary even if your Account is
closed. The Daily Periodic Rate is the APR divided by 365.

Your Account is Delinquent if payment is received late or is
returned or the Account is overlimit; Derogatory if, in any
12-month period, the Account is Delinquent twice; and Seriously
Delinquent if you fail to make at least the Minimum Payment Due for
two consecutive Billing Cycles.  Accounts are no longer Derogatory
or Delinquent if no late or returned payment occurs and the Account
is not overlimit for 12 consecutive months (a ""Cured Account"").

Minimum Payment
The Minimum Payment Due for each Billing Cycle will normally be: 2%
of the Balance shown on your statement (or may be higher to ensure
that it is sufficient to pay the Finance Charges) plus the amount
of any Past Due Amount and the amount by which the Balance exceeds
your credit limit.  This payment will not be less than $15 or your
total Balance.

These changes apply to outstanding balances for Purchases and
Balance Transfers on the effective date and new transactions.

If you have questions please email us at
accountinformation@nextcard.com or call us at 1-877-704-0273,
between the hours of 8 A.M. and 5 P.M. PST Monday-Friday.

Thank You.

A man boards an airplane and takes his seat. As he
settles in, he glances up and sees a very beautiful
woman boarding the plane.

He soon realizes she is heading straight towards
his seat. Lo and behold, she takes the seat right
beside his. Eager to strike up a conversation, he
blurts out ""Business trip or vacation?""

She turns, smiles and says, ""Business. I'm going to
the annual ""Nymphomaniac Convention in Chicago.""

He swallows hard. Here is the most gorgeous woman he
has ever seen sitting next to him and she's going to a
meeting for nymphomaniacs. Struggling to maintain his
composure, he calmly asks, ""What's your business role
at this convention?""

""Lecturer"", she says. ""I use my experience to
debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.""

""Really"", he says, ""what myths are those?""

""Well"", she explains, ""one popular myth is that
African American men are the most well endowed when,
in fact, it's the Native American Indian who is most
likely to possess that trait.

Another popular myth is that French men are the best
lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent.
However, we have found that the best potential lover
in all categories is the Southern Redneck.""

Suddenly the woman becomes a little uncomfortable and
blushes.

""I'm sorry"", she says. ""I shouldn't be discussing
this with you.

I don't even know your name!""

""Tonto"", the man says, ""Tonto Goldstein. But my
friends call me Bubba.""

     Roadways can often become icy without warning, presenting serious
     hazards to motorists, so you should keep snow chains on your tires at
     all times.

     Flash flooding can be a serious threat during heavy thunderstorms; if
     you are at any time abruptly swept away by a raging stream or river,
     be prepared to take emergency action.

     If your community is threatened by a tornado, close all doors and
     windows, caulk them shut, then twitch and quiver fiercely as you hope
     to God you make it out of this thing alive.

     When driving through heavy rain, motorists should accelerate
     significantly to remove water from their windshield as fast as
     possible.

     Never attempt to drive through standing water if it is deeper than
     your car.

     Do not temp fate by golfing during a thunderstorm; in 1998 alone, over
     14,000 golfers completely fucked up their favorite golf shoes by
     walking on saturated greens, and another 9,200 were injured by flying
     clubs whose grips had become unexpectedly slippery.

     Sandstorms can occur without warning in desert climates, and present
     serious blinding and choking hazards to people caught in them. If you
     find yourself caught in a sandstorm, you should immediately reconsider
     what hell your were doing wandering through the goddamn desert in the
     first place.

     While not necessarily weather phenomena, earthquakes can be powerful
     and devastating. If you fear you might be living in an
     earthquake-prone region, consider moving to less threatened locations,
     such as Antarctica or the moon.

American)
_______

We'll go forward from this moment
by Leonard Pitts

It's my job to have something to say.

They pay me to provide words that help make sense of
that which troubles the American soul. But in this
moment of airless shock when hot tears sting
disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say,
the only words that seem to fit, must be addressed to
the unknown author of this suffering.

You monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard.

What lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's
attack on our World Trade Center, our Pentagon, us?
What was it you hoped we would learn?  Whatever it
was, please know that you failed.

Did you want us to respect your cause? You just damned
your cause.

Did you want to make us fear? You just steeled our
resolve.

Did you want to tear us apart? You just brought us
together.

Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast and
quarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, social,
political and class division, but a family
nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of
expending tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural
minutiae -- a singer's revealing dress, a ball
team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse. We're wealthy,
too, spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and
material goods, and maybe because of that, we
walk through life with a certain sense of blithe
entitlement. We are fundamentally decent, though --
peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to know
the right thing and to do it. And we are, the
overwhelming majority of us, people of faith,
believers in a just and loving God.

Some people -- you, perhaps -- think that any or all
of this makes us weak.  You're mistaken. We are not
weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot
be measured by arsenals.

IN PAIN

Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are
in shock. We're still grappling with the unreality of
the awful thing you did, still working to make
ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect
from some  Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot
development from a Tom Clancy novel.

Both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and
the probable final death toll, your attacks are likely
to go down as the worst acts of terrorism in the
history of the United States and, probably, the
history of the world.

You've bloodied us as we have never been bloodied
before.

But there's a gulf of difference between making us
bloody and making us fall.

This is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter
sorrow the last time anyone hit us this hard, the last
time anyone brought us such abrupt and monumental
pain. When roused, we are righteous in our outrage,
terrible in our force.

When provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear
any suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the
pursuit of justice.

I tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know
my people, as you, I think, do not. What I know
reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with
dread of the future.

In the days to come, there will be recrimination and
accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose
failure allowed this to happen and what can be
done to prevent it from happening again. There will be
heightened security, misguided talk of revoking basic
freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment sobered,
chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably
determined.

THE STEEL IN US

You see, the steel in us is not always readily
apparent. That aspect of our character is seldom
understood by people who don't know us well. On
this day, the family's bickering is put on hold.

As Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn,
and as Americans, we will rise in defense of all that
we cherish.

So I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It
occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the
depths of your hatred. If that's the case, consider
the message received. And take this message in
exchange: You don't know my people. You don't know
what we're capable of. You don't know what you
just started. But you're about to learn.",Non Abusive

me no difference if ya'll want to go out for an evening on the town.  Sounds 
good to me.  Some of us are heading over to Roger Creager at Garden in the

the weekend or not.  I am handling all of the food for the weekend and the 
only other issue is who is riding with who.  Jay is taking his Expedition. 
We are leaving from my house Friday afternoon.  So, Don, Travis and Gerald 
will be coming from the Clear Lake area and I guess are planning on riding 
together.  The question is do ya'll want to meet us at my house?  I have a 
map I can fax over or you can look up where we are staying on the internet 
and get directions.  The web-site is willowcreekranchtexas.com.  There are

off of Westheimer if anyone is interested in doing that.  You can call him

Don't forget that it is August again and time to  renew those hunting license's.  We will be leaving to go to Mason on the  evening of Aug. 31st and hunting early that Saturday morning.  Just a  reminder to get your license before we leave on that Friday.  We are  staying at the Willow Creek Ranch homes.  I just wanted to let everyone  know so someone can remember where we are staying.

Subject: Unclassified rules


These are  the rules, no exceptions especially 15.


1. Any Man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally
killed and eaten by his fellow partygoers.

2. Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.

3. It is ok for a man to cry under the following circumstances:
a. When a heroic dog dies to save its master
b. The moment Angelina Jolie starts unbuttoning her blouse
c. After wrecking your boss' Ferrari
d. One hour, 12 minutes, 37 seconds into The Crying Game
e. When your Date is using her teeth

4. Unless he murdered someone in your family, you must bail a
friend out of jail within 12 hours.

5. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend move
a. Your legs have been severed in a freak threshing accident

6. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend of a friend move:
a. You'd rather stay home and watch speed buggy reruns

7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is  off
limits forever, unless you actually marry her.

8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy who's  running

late is 5 minutes. Maximum waiting time: 6 minutes. For a girl,  you
have
to wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the  classic

1-10 scale.

9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's fridge is
forbidden. Gripe at will if the temperature is unsuitable.

10. No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for  another

man. (In fact, even remembering your buddy's birthday is strictly
optional.)

11. On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops,  not the

weakest.

12. While your girlfriend must bond with your buddies'  girlfriends
within 30 minutes of meeting them, you are not required to make  nice
with her gal pals' significant dick-heads--- low level sports
bonding is all the law requires (sorry ladies, it's called a  double
standard because it's twice as true).

13. Unless you have signed a lucrative endorsement contract, do  not
appear in public wearing more than one swoosh.

14. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you  may
always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never  ask
who's playing.

15. You may flatulate in front of a woman only after you have  brought
her to climax. If you trap her head under the covers for the  purpose of

flatulent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend.

16. Only in situations of Moral and/or Ass peril are you allowed  to
kick another guy in the nuts.

18. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.

19. Friends don't let friends wear Speedos. Ever. Issue closed.

20. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem---you didn't  see
nothin'.

21. Women who claim they ""love to watch sports"" must be treated  as
spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the  ability to
pick a buffalo wing clean (chicken wing).

22. You must offer heartfelt and public condolences over the  death of a

girlfriend's cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire
and threw it into a ceiling fan.

23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman  must
remain sober enough to fight.

24. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice  of
pizza, but not both. That's just plain mean.

25. If you complement a guy on his six-pack, you'd better be  talking
about his choice of beer.

26. Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a buddy of  yours,
except if she's withholding sex pending your response.

27. Phrases that may not be uttered to another man while lifting
weights:
a. Yeah, Baby, Push it!
b. C'mon, give me one more! Harder!
c. Another set and we can hit the showers!
d. Nice Ass, Are you a Sagittarius?

28. Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal  footing:

both urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other  situations, an

almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need.

29. Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than  you
are able to have sex with her. Keep a stopwatch by the phone;  Hang
up if necessary.

30. When a buddy is trying to hook you up, you may sabotage him  only in

a manner that gives you no chance of getting laid either.

31. You cannot rat out a coworker who shows up at work with a  massive
hangover. You may however, hide the aspirin, smear his chair with
limburger cheese, turn the brightness dial all the way down so he
thinks his monitor is broken, and have him paged over the
loudspeaker every seven minutes.

32. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly ""just a  friend""
have carnal drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling  weird and

guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion  about
what a big mistake it was.

33. Always split aces and eights. No arguments.",Non Abusive

Bad-dream Shotwell,

I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day.  I
tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year, to no avail.  Just
wanted to catch up, and go drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger.

Doing fine down here in Houston.  I bought a house in League City.  In
addition, I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the
summer.  We are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship.
I am doing well at excelr, managing the real-time power trading desk and
trading.  excelr, as you have seen in the paper, is experiencing some
trouble.  We are reasonably sure we will merge with Dynegy in mid to
late 2002.  Family is doing well; my sister is about to have her second
baby.  Travis is back from his year and a half tour in Europe, and took
a position with Cemex as an account manager.  Dad is about 3/4 retired
and he and mom are doing a fair amount of hunting & fishing.  Travis & I
are gonna spend Thanksgiving in West Texas, deer hunting.

How's life in Hooterville?  I heard that you are full on retired!
FANTASTIC!  What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?
Hopefully consuming large quantities of beer & tequila and blowing you
eardrums out with Jimmy Buffett!

Tell when you are not busy and I will drive up, or have you down to the
house and the bayhouse.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Drop me a line when you have a chance!

that occurred last week concerning the storm.  He has presented a very
thorough outline of  the document.  He is asking for comments from all of the
residents.  We do realize that many of the residents do not have time right
now to write their  experiences and many people are not receiving the emails.
 It is very important from an historical point of view that we do document
events so that presentations can be made on behalf of the residents at future
meetings and planning sessions.  Thank you. Mary G. Strickland

Marc:

My explorations of Bastrop Bayou have been done on ""skinny water"" craft.
However, I have been there during very low winter water, where the deep
channel was very clear. It does wind through shallower areas,
particularly
just north of the ICW. If you take it really slow and read the channel
with
a depth sounder or (more dependably) with a cane pole about 10-12 feet
long,
finding the deep water shouldn't be a problem. However, for parts of the
trip, I suspect carrying a six foot draft could be interesting (not your
problem, fortunately). I hope the FM road bridge is upstream from your
friend's house; it looks like a 45 footer (marginal for your 32, I'll
bet).

Maybe your friend has a boat, or a neighbor with a boat, and you can
arrange
to go for a ""look see"" ride armed with your cane pole. Just from casual
observation, I've often seen shallow spots crop up near waterfront
housing
from yard runoff, etc. that might cause more problems for you than the
bayou
itself.

I'd guess that the biggest problems for you will be at the ICW
intersection
(it's sometimes difficult to find the deep entrance there: just keep
poking
your nose in, slowly...it's there...) and at the upstream end of your
trip.
Of course, it's always fun to ""divine"" the navigational meaning attached
to
a particular piece of PVC stuck in the mud here and there.

Short of a prior ""look see"", you might consider what I often do. The
dinghy
is in the water. towed on a short painter and available for instant use.
If
I see a shoaling trend or lose my ""feel"" of where deep water lies ahead,
I'll anchor (short scope) where I am (although not in the ICW!) and
explore
in the dink using a sounding pole or lead line. Cindy and I worked our
way
across the flats on the Bahama Bank side of the Berry Islands using that
technique several years ago. Out there, they say you can tell depth by
the
water color - well, yes, but on the banks water that is 4 feet looks the
same shade of white as 2 feet...or 6 inches for that matter...problem is
that you can see where you left bottom paint... Ya' jus' gotta go slo'

Sounds like a fun trip. I'd like to hear more.

Regards,

Ed Campbell

Bad-dream Shotwell,

I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day.  I
tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year, to no avail.  Just
wanted to catch up, and go drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger.

Doing fine down here in Houston.  I bought a house in League City.  In
addition, I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the
summer.  We are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship.
I am doing well at excelr, managing the real-time power trading desk and
trading.  excelr, as you have seen in the paper, is experiencing some
trouble.  We are reasonably sure we will merge with Dynegy in mid to
late 2002.  Family is doing well; my sister is about to have her second
baby.  Travis is back from his year and a half tour in Europe, and took
a position with Cemex as an account manager.  Dad is about 3/4 retired
and he and mom are doing a fair amount of hunting & fishing.  Travis & I
are gonna spend Thanksgiving in West Texas, deer hunting.

How's life in Hooterville?  I heard that you are full on retired!
FANTASTIC!  What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?
Hopefully consuming large quantities of beer & tequila and blowing you
eardrums out with Jimmy Buffett!

Tell when you are not busy and I will drive up, or have you down to the
house and the bayhouse.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Drop me a line when you have a chance!

How are you? I have been busy ever since trying to get everything in order
to leave. I think they want to get as much work out of me as possible until
I leave, not that I blame them. It even doesn't make me mad because I
haven't had time to think about it. Anyway the work has also been more
interesting in the last two months than the two before I left for holidays.

I now find myself in peculiar situation similar to maybe going off to
school. I am leaving somewhere where I have made a lot of close friends and
had heaps of great, and trying experiences and am preparing for the next
step in life, oh no a CAREER, ouch that hurts. I however am excited on where
this new road may lead me and as you know man I am ready to come home. I
sure wish you could have been here for the going a way party, it was so
fantastic, other than not getting laid. I am so tired of these foreign know
it all, fascist, snobby, anorexic, egotistical, meniacal, deceptive, nose
ring wearing, no dancing, big shoe sporting, tasteless,  putas! I really
can't wait to meet some nice Texas girls or someone with similar interest.

I miss you a lot too and can't wait to have some nice parties and dinners as
well, I am more of a budding Chef. My guitar playing is getting a little
better. So what's the scoop. Anything happening in work, relationship,
houseshopping, fishing hunting. So what's up there. Mom says you're working
like crazy and occasionally looking for a house. How's that going. I can
tell you, it never fails. No matter where I go I seem to run into decisions
all with the same gravity, I guess if there is third guarantee in life it is
decisions. If you haven't finished by the time I return I would like to help
you

I can't wait! I have had a great time here but I really am ready to return
home. I know now I never wish to permanenetly live outside of Texas. Anyway
I'm so busy packin and taking care of paperwork and contracts and bla bla
bla it takes all my time! My last day of work is Next Wednesday (28th) and
then I will travel and visit some friends for about three weeks. This
weekend, since I'm not at home for Mardi Gras I will go to visit a Thomas in
Cologne Germany and go to one of the greatest Karnival Celebrations in the
world. The following weekend my flatmate David and I are off to Rome and
then Budapest (Hungary). Then the last week (on my home) I will leave Zurich
on the 15th of March and stop off in Den Hague and Amsterdam (Holland) for 6
days to visit Natalie. Well I am not leaving for a while and will constantly
have acces to the internet so write back and let me know how things are
going. All the best on at work and on finding a house und so weiter. By the
way I am searching for some jobs there have you heard from anyone or can I
write to anyone?

Love ya bro,
Travis

we are watching the weather forecast closely.  hoping we can avoid rain.
if it looks to be too shitty, the trip may have to be canceled. may be a
last minute decision.  be forewarned.

Something we really need is a gas-fueled camping lantern.  Reid claims
to not have one & neither does Tom Booth (by the way, Booth is going
too).  Do you have one?  That would be something you could bring.  We
need it to see at night in the cabin & whatnot so we can play trivia or

By KEVIN MORAN
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle
GALVESTON -- Two Texas City physicians should pay $10.5 million in
damages for failing to diagnose testicular cancer in a patient more than
three years ago, a jury decided Thursday.
The award in a medical malpractice lawsuit against Texas City's
Beeler-Manske Clinic, Dr. John H. Cochrane Jr. and Dr. Salvador Faus
came after a weeklong trial in the Galveston court of state District
Judge Frank Carmona.
The jury found that in May 1997, the physicians failed to diagnose
testicular cancer in Bryan Davidson, 41, said his Houston attorney, Mike
Mallia.
The cancer went undiagnosed for 13 months, after which Davidson, of
Santa Fe, underwent surgeries to remove not only one testicle but also
parts of his lungs, to which cancer had spread, Mallia said Thursday.
Cochrane and Faus had attributed lumps on Davidson's testicle to
side-effects of a vasectomy, Mallia said.
He said that Beeler-Manske physician David Nickeson finally made a
correct diagnosis.
Houston attorneys Richard Law and Robert Scheerer, who represented the
clinic, Cochrane and Faus, could not be reached for comment.
The defendants maintained that Davidson did not develop cancer until
after his May 1997 examination, Mallia said. He added that defense
attorneys did not indicate Thursday whether their clients would appeal
the case.
The jury of eight men and four women deliberated about 15 hours over
three days before returning the judgment of $10.5 million in actual
damages.
Davidson, who is on medical leave after 16 years as a Texas City
chemical plant employee, and his wife, Debbie, also a plaintiff in the
case, did not seek punitive damages, Mallia said.
Had Davidson's cancer been detected early on, he might have avoided
extensive chemotherapy and lung surgery, Mallia said.
After one round of five chemotherapy treatments, Mallia said, Davidson
was declared cancer-free. But the disease cropped up again, he said,
forcing Davidson to undergo harsher chemotherapy.
""Early diagnosis would have meant that he would have had just surgery to
remove that testicle,"" Mallia said. ""Some doctors, conservatively, would
have given just two rounds of chemotherapy just in case something has
metastasized microscopically.""
As of September, Mallia said, Davidson had been cancer-free for a year.
He was scheduled for a three-month checkup at Houston's M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center after the trial ended Thursday.",Non Abusive

$4.2 million.  Our budget was $10 million at the start of the year, then it 
was changed to $5million when they took the 5% away from us.  After the slow 
summer and when doubt settled in on our ability to achieve our goal it was 
knocked down to $3 million.  However, when we proved that we were fighters 
and not quitters and soared right through the $3 million, the crawfish came 
along and knocked it up to $4 million and then up to $5 million.  Regardless 
of all the crawfish boils we have been invited to this year, the bottom line 
is that you never quit and I can say that I am DAMN proud of our group.  We 
have been given 4 different managers for this year.  We started with the 
infamous Jason Haile. He left in February because he had his doubts about us 
achieving our goal.  Then Mr. Mark Dana Davis took the interim until he was 
able to bring in Jeff King.   Jeff was with us from April until July and did 
a great job, he represented us well and knew how to bring out our strengths.  
In August we inherited Mitch Robinson.  We had to pack our bags and move into 
Mr. Robinson's neighborhood.  Mitch taught us the operation side of the 
utilities and we showed him that trading real time is not as easy as it 
looks.  Mitch also fought for us,  I was in several different meetings in 
which I saw him fight for us,  I know we had our differences but at the end 
of the day he really stood up for us.  He came to a conclusion that his 
skills and interest are dealing with assets.  Now going into the New Year we 
have been given a new challenge.  I would like to say that I strongly believe 
that we are and can stay at the top of the industry as the best.  In order to 
stay at the top we have to believe and become the best that we can be.  You 
never stay the same, you either get better or you slide down the hill.  
Everyone of us has an opportunity.  There are always going to be days that we 
feel like what in the HELL am I doing here.  However if you stay positive and 
take care of your responsibilities we will stay on top.  Patience, 
Perseverance, and Organization are our keys to success.  To keep from 
rambling I will close with this great philosophy.  Every one of us has 
talents and desires and they are all different.  We are still a team and 
always will be a team and to be a successful team we have to have  the utmost 
respect for one another and you have to take it upon yourself to not give any 
of your teammates a reason to not respect you. My only expectations are for 
you to give 100% and know your role.  If you do not know your role come see 
me.

Thanks and God Bless

Amigo,
Good to hear from you.  Yeah, the pending merger with Dynegy will greatly
impact our business.  We are not sure what the power trading desk will look
like in the new structure.  Dynegy has a sizable real-time trading desk due
to it's assets.  The good thing is that I just signed a two year contract,
about a month ago.

How is your gig?

	More upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.

	 In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. 

	Through all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. 

	I came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. 

	This coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week and next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afternoon. Finally, here are the results of this past weekend's picks with the number missed by each person after their name.

Paul Harvey Writes:

We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them
worse.

For my grandchildren, I'd like better.  I'd really like for them to
know about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cream and leftover meat
loaf sandwiches.  I really would.

I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn
honesty by being cheated.

I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the
car.
And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are
sixteen.

It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your
old dog put to sleep. I hope you get a black eye fighting for something
you believe in, I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger
brother. And it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle
of the room, but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you
because he's scared, I hope you let him.

When you want to see a movie and your little brother wants to tag
along, I hope you'll let him. I hope you have to walk uphill to school with
your friends and that you live in a town where you can do it safely. On
rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I hope you don't ask your
driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be seen riding with
someone as uncool as your Mom.

If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one
instead of buying one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read
books. When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add
and subtract in  your head.

I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on
a girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory
soap tastes like.

May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove
and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.  I don't care if you try a
beer once, but I hope you don't like it.  And if a friend offers you
dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend.

I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go
fishing with your Uncle.  May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy
during the holidays.  I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a
baseball through your neighbor's window and that she hugs you and
kisses you at Christmas timewhen you give her a plaster mold of your hand.

These things I wish for you - tough times and disappointment, hard work
and happiness.  To me, it's the only way to appreciate life.

Written with a pen.  Sealed with a kiss.  I'm here for you.  And if I
die before you do, I'll go to heaven and wait for you.

Send this to all of your friends.  We secure our friends, not by
accepting favors, but by doing them.

When asked this riddle, 80% of kindergarten kids got the answer,
compared to 17% of Stanford University seniors.
What is greater than God, More evil than the devil, The poor have it,
The rich need it, And if you eat it, you'll die?
Send this to 10 people and then press shift and you will get the
answer.
P.S.  You wont believe this, but this really does give you the

Repayment Procedure  

I called MAPP to get a better understanding of the pending Dec. 18th LRP 
changes as explained in detail below.
Currently the ""source"" generator is responsible for the Losses.  The new 
policy states that the Scheduling customer is now responsible for Losses.  
MAPP is implementing this change as a requirement under their tariff.  
Changes to software and systems has delayed this change from being 
implemented any earlier.
What it means to excelr as a Schedule F customer:
 1)  excelr (or any Schedule F customer) is responsible for  losses based on a 
yet to be published Loss Matrix that MAPP will provide on it web page.  The 
loss  calculation matrix and methodolgy will not change, just the party 
responsible for providing the losses.  When scheduling energy, excelr must  
either schedule physical losses or buy losses from a designated Source 
Scheduling participant (SSP).  The SSP will then be responsible for 
disbursing the losses to each designated CA a week later.
The identity of the SSP will be the Source of power (if a MAPP member), or 
the POR on your Schedule F (If Source is outside MAPP).

Subject: Notice of Pending Changes (effective 12/18/2000) to MAPP's Loss 
Repayment Procedure


Notice of new MAPP Loss Repayment Policies and Procedures

At the direction of the Regional Transmission Committee of MAPP, new Loss
Repayment Policies and Procedures will be implemented on December 18, 2000.
These changes make the transmission customer, as identified on the OASIS
reservation, responsible for paying energy losses on MAPP Schedule F
transmission service.  Previously, the MAPP Source entity has been
responsible for paying these losses.  These changes do not modify the
application of MAPP's Loss Repayment Procedure (LRP) to MAPP Member Open
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) customers.  Changes to the administration
of Schedule F loss repayment include:
o The Schedule F transmission customer will now be responsible for the LRP
losses on their energy schedules.
o Payment of third party impacts due to ""through flowing"" Schedule F
transactions (where the Source and Sink are both outside MAPP) will be
included in the LRP.
o To facilitate the payment of third party losses, the Customer will make

> What is the ERCOT portal?
> The ERCOT portal will consolidate information

>
> What is the portal release 2 for the ERCOT

> The portal release 2 is a pre-release version of
> the portal that will include static web pages
> that have no functional behavior. The purpose of
> this release is to provide exposure to the
> portal user interface look and feel, and not to
> demonstrate specific portal functionality. This
> is not intended to be a final product release.
> The functional component of the portal is
> currently under development, and will not be
> fully tested in a manner that is suitable for
> public release by 10/31. (This includes client
> side validation, file upload, error pages,
> confirmation pages, etc.) Future portal releases
> will have these features enabled.  Unlike the
> earlier proof of concept release, no usability
> tests will be conducted on the release 2 portal
> version. Because the portal will contain static
> view-only user interfaces, there is no back end
> systems integration between the portal and
> Siebel, LODESTAR, etc.
> How can you access the portal release 2 version

> The address for the portal release 2 version of
> the portal is:

Thanks for your reply.
Here's what I have learned from our conversation:
Since I have not gotten a specific response from my customers,  my spots were ""captured"" by Don and Juan's group?
I acknowledge that I have not relayed specific names for Reliant and TXU, as they havent responded after many calls,   but did not receive notice that I was to lose my spots.
I expected to be able to include my employees,  as Juan and Don have now done with my spots.

Don and Juan have invited my employee,  Steve Olinde,  with one of my original spots.   He will attend.

I am not trying to give you a hard time,  but I need to know who authorized filling my spots?

Subject: MAIN Homepage Data


FYI, 

Based on consultation among MAIN staff and with the MAIN PC chair as well as the chair of the newly form MAIN Security Working Group, we will take or have taken the following actions in the interest of bulk power system physical security: 

1) All data on the MAIN home page formerly considered ""public"" but now deemed to have the potential to be used in sabotage acts against the interconnected electric systems is no longer available for immediate download. 

2) Those entities who have a valid, regular use of such data will be given password access. Current MAIN homepage passwords will work and anyone who has OASIS access via TradeAgent will automatically have access via the the links provided on the OASIS after log-in. 

3) Anyone who has a valid but infrequent use of such data will be screened before such data is supplied. This will be done through validation of phone and/or street address as well as company affiliation as necessary. In short, we will know the person who has asked for data. 

4) Instruction and/or forms will be available on the web to facilitate item 3 above. 

5) A modest charge to accomplish item 3 may also be required. 

At a minimum the following formerly public data is included in this protected group: 

- All MAIN electric system maps 
- Detailed capacity reports such as the 411/860 
- Parts of the FERC 715 submittal 
- Detailed roster information 
- outage listings 
- seven days or older ATC cases 
- Transmission Assessment reports (TASG, FSSG) 
- All other power flow cases (MDB, MMWG, etc.) 

I recognize that reports such as the 411/860 and FERC 715 also reside publicly on the FERC/DOE sites. Efforts will be made to have such data removed from the government sites as well and, I understand that FERC yesterday has already taken such action. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any question.

If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me

Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...

First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the

Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric

In the midst of all the uncertainty going on with our credit issues and the Big E, a situation might arise in the near future (today forward)  when our counterparties default on their obligations to EPMI. The heads of the desk have requested that the hourly group monitor these defaults in a timely manner and report instances to our credit dept ASAP.

This is an example of what might occur and how we should handle the situation:

DETM has a preschedule with us that they are obligated to deliver 50 MW 7-22. They will call EPMI and say we are not going to deliver the power due to the fact of EPMI's credit issues. If this call occurs, we are then short to our downstream, and must notify that counterparty that they will not be receiving the power because our upstream is not delivering the power and our downstream can pass Firm LD's upstream. 

Before we let DETM off the phone, we must get some information from them: First, note the name, time, schedule, tag involved, and also tell them they need to send a fax stating DETM is not agreeing to their FIRM LD obligation. The fax number to TJ's desk is 713.646.8272 If they disagree, make sure you get the information above to let the lawyers track the information flow.

In order to help keep track of the companies defaulting deals with us Steve set up a spreadsheet for us.  You can find it in the 24Hour folder under Steve Pan. It's the ""cuts"" excel spreadsheet. M:Electric/24Hour/Steve Pan/cuts.exl

Reese and I have tried to document everything as best we can in Lotus Notes (in the scheduling window) and on the spreadsheet.  The companies have cited they are not obligated to fax us anything so we've tried to get as much done over the phone as possible.  For the guys checking out Saturday-Monday, you might want to look at the notes we put in the scheduling window for schedules flowing Dec 1.  

Don also asked that we check out defaults with all counter-parties just like regular schedule checkouts so we know for sure what is flowing and what is not.    

anyway, just giving the weekend crew a heads up. have a most wonderful time.

Subject:	excelr- Firm LD Transactions

Hey crew,

In the midst of all the uncertainty going on with our credit issues and the Big E, a situation might arise in the near future (today forward)  when our counterparties default on their obligations to EPMI. The heads of the desk have requested that the hourly group monitor these defaults in a timely manner and report instances to our credit dept ASAP.

This is an example of what might occur and how we should handle the situation:

DETM has a preschedule with us that they are obligated to deliver 50 MW 7-22. They will call EPMI and say we are not going to deliver the power due to the fact of EPMI's credit issues. If this call occurs, we are then short to our downstream, and must notify that counterparty that they will not be receiving the power because our upstream is not delivering the power and our downstream can pass Firm LD's upstream. 

Before we let DETM off the phone, we must get some information from them: First, note the name, time, schedule, tag involved, and also tell them they need to send a fax stating DETM is not agreeing to their FIRM LD obligation. The fax number to TJ's desk is 713.646.8272 If they disagree, make sure you get the information above to let the lawyers track the information flow.

AEP has informed us over the past couple of nights that they MUST HAVE tag numbers in order to do next day checkouts.  They claim that this has always been the case but we know that in the past we have not needed the tag #'s in order to check out. It appears AEP enjoys being difficult.  So it looks like going forward we will need tag numbers from the schedulers in order to check our properly with AEP.

I've updated the transmission rates table for May - here is the location:

If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me know and I can put a copy of it whereever.

Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...

First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49

Please pass this along to the rest of the group, if any of you have any questions or suggestions - don't hesitate to call.

Transmission Scenarios for MDEA

What would the following procedures be for MDEA's network services.

1.	Buying megawatts from the market and bringing in from outside of Entergy.
a.	Ex.  AEP-TVA-EES-MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources) on the Entergy OASIS, POR=TVA, POD=EES, SOURCE=AEP, SINK=MDEA, BID PRICE = $0.0.  The request will be subject to interface availability and will be evaluated by Entergy accordingly.

2.	Buying megawatts from the market inside of Entergy.  
a.	Ex.  Lagen- MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources) on the Entergy OASIS, POR=LAGN, POD=EES, SOURCE=(LAGN UNIT NAME), SINK=MDEA, BID PRICE = $0.0.  The request will be subject to availability and will be evaluated by Entergy accordingly. (If the source is an Entergy unit (or AXIA) use POR=EES. 

3.	Using the network services request number for the Sepa contract when Sepa is not flowing and we can bring MGW's in from the Tva border.
a.	Ex.  We find 11 MGW's  LGE-TVA-EES-MDEA.
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources) on the Entergy OASIS, POR=TVA, POD=MDEA, SOURCE=LGE, SINK=MDEA, BID PRICE = $0.0. Put a comment in the request that states this request is modifying (displacing) the existing request (SEPA; OASIS #851472). - I need to clarify this with Entergy but this is the approach I recommend.

NOTE: When scheduling on the above requests, the transmission is considered F-7 priority level. When you want to schedule intra-day (hourly), you must request non-firm (import for Native/NST loads. This type of transmission is NN-6 priority level.
Remember - all bid prices are $0.0 because MDEA is charged by their load share ratio.

This is all of the scenarios that I can think of that may cause a problem.  I just want to make sure that everyone is on the same page especially with Entergy Transmission.

23017,baughman-d/power/24_hour/155.,<6435557.1075855150691.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"The Commission issued an order on May 8, 2001 in Illinois Power Co. Docket No. ER01-123 (as well as ComEd, Ameren and Alliance) that accepted the Settlement filed by the Alliance and MISO on 3/31/01.  The Settlement:
provided for the continuation of two separate RTOs in the Midwest - ARTO and MISO - to be operational by 12/15/01
provides for a single, non-pancaked Super-Regional rate for transactions with sources and sinks within the two- RTO Super Region
provides that ARTO and MISO will negotiate with PJM to develop a joint rate methodology
includes an Inter-Regional Cooperation Agreement committing the ARTO and MISO to develop compatible protocols and formats, share information and data, develop a combined reservations and scheduling system, coordinate on TLRs, and develop procedures for real-time operational disputes.
allowed withdrawal of IP, ComEd and Ameren from MISO to join ARTO with an exit fee of $60 million to cover start up costs.

excelr had filed comments opposing the settlement arguing that it failed to resolve the issues of the Midwest market.  excelr argued the the settlement did not provide for sufficient RTO scope, did not resolve rate pancaking, parallel path flow, and other operational and seams issues.

The Commission's order on the settlement continues the Hebert ""incremental approach"" to RTO's that it has exhibited in its prior RTO orders.  The Chief Judge had certified the settlement over excelr's opposition, claiming  excelr was asking the FERC to go beyond the scope of Order No. 2000.  Some of the important findings in the order are summarized below.

Accepted the Alliance stakeholder process over objections of excelr and several marketers.  Alliance will file its stakeholder plan by May 15 and parties may raise concerns at that time.  This does seem a late filing given that the RTO is to be operational by 12/15/01.  In the meantime, Alliance has held three meetings, focusing on interconnection procedures and congestion management.  They are continuing to meet with stakeholders every two weeks - this seems better than required by this order.
The Super-regional rate is not applicable to imports of generation into the Region.  This is definitely an example of the ""incremental approach.""  The Commission was very impressed that the Alliance and MISO represented the largest areas ever proposed for elimination of rate pancaking.  The order did recognize the competitive advantage this gave to generators within the Super Region vis-a-vis those located outside the Region, but noted that absent the settlement, transactions would incur two separate transmission rates.
 Sufficiency of scope and configuration will be determined in the respective RTO dockets.  Although the settlement provided that the scope of ARTO and MISO were sufficient, the Commission refused to make that determination in this order.   Note that the Alliance scope and configuration has been found to be sufficient to comply with Order No. 2000 in the Alliance January 24, 2001 order.
excelr argued the Midwest transmission grid should be under the control of a single operator to provide for a seamless market.  The FERC finds that issue to be premature.  This is again the ""incremental approach;""  the Commission encourages further efforts to build on the framework of the settlement to develop common processes and move toward an ultimate goal of a single operational RTO for the Midwest.  This open-ended issue may provide a good opportunity to set up a meeting with FERC staff to discuss future steps to work toward this ultimate goal.
excelr had argued that the IRCA was not a sufficient commitment to a seamless Midwest market.  The order accepts this aspect of the settlement, but allows that excelr and all parties can raise further concerns once coordination proposals are filed.
The Commission will not require joint energy imbalance and congestion management mechanisms at this time.  FERC found no basis in Order No. 2000 to find that multiple systems could not be compatible.  The order did not address excelr's argument that the settlement should provide for a real-time energy market, rather than just a balancing market.
A market monitoring committee is to be formed which will agree upon an independent market monitor for the Cooperating RTOs.
The settlement provides for a moratorium on the transitional pricing structure through 2004, subject to an exception for new investment..  The FERC accepts this provision due the rate certainty it provides.

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, =
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring mo=
del was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created th=
is model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found th=
e old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five st=
rikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our=
 markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our competit=
ors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a compl=
ement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are trading=
 and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and will ev=
entually have them on a daily basis.

        I just wanted to pass on information regarding the use of the NERC generator shift factor (GSF) viewer.  This can be accessed via the NERC TLR public web site ( <http://crc.nerc.com>), as indicated in the TLR document.  Next, click on the GSF viewer button.  A special username / password is not required to access this information.  We are using Netscape version 4.75 in the Security Center.  The GSF viewer seems to work fine via Netscape.  When accessing the viewer: 

1) ""Matrix"" box:  Select current day.  The program will run to collect the current generator shift factor information. 
2) ""Report"" box: As indicated in the document, there are a number of different ways to display (or retrieve) this information. 
2A) Using the ""report box"", if you select the ""top100 pairs"", the program will provide inter-control area generator shift factor information based upon the best 10 increasing units, against the best 10 decreasing units. 
2B) Using the ""report box"", if you select the ""all transactions"", the program will provide generator shift factor information based upon the ""set 1"" and ""set 2"" control areas you select.  If you want intra-control area generator shift factor information, select the same control area for both ""set 1"" and ""set 2"". 
3) Check out the other options as well.

23037,baughman-d/power/24_hour/173.,<25416302.1075855151205.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Attached is a presentation for your review that illustrates a new method for curtailment of transactions that is still based on CPM, but give partial-credit for varying levels of firmness in a stack.

As you probably know, when a transaction leg is supported by multiple transmission reservations it is referred to as a ""stack"" of transmission; specifically, a vertical stack.  Under the current curtailment procedures under which we operate, such a stack is always valued at the LOWEST curtailment priority of the stack.  In other words, if I combine 50MW of firm transmission and 50MW of Non-Firm Secondary, my 100MW of transmission capacity is now treated as if it ALL had a curtailment priority of 1.  Further, if an off-path constraint occurs, the entire transaction is treated with a priority of 1, even if every other leg is Firm.

As I'm sure you can see, this stinks.  So I have drafted up a proposal for what I think is a better way of doing this.  Under the proposal, 50MW would be treated as priority 1, while the other 50 would be treated as Firm.  This would reduce the SIZE on-path curtailments and off-path curtailments.  As far as whether it increases or decrease the NUMBER of transactions curtailed, that will depend on several different factors (how prevalent stacking is, how often stacks vary in firmness, etc...).

Please review and give comments, as I plan to present to the IDCWG in a few weeks.  It is my opinion that this is a good idea, but I want to make sure you all (and any others you think should be asked) agree.

23038,baughman-d/power/24_hour/174.,<23873017.1075855151232.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I am pleased to announce that a new feature is being added to the E-Tag system: the Potential Adjust List (PAL).

As you may or may not know, there is currently an ""Adjust List"" that is issued when TLRs are called. An ""Adjust List"" is a recommendation from the IDC that describes what transactions should be cut and by how much to achieve needed relief to eliminate a constraint.  This Adjust List sent out to Generation and Load Control Areas and Tag Authors for all transactions that are being recommended for curtailment.  It is intended to aid in coordination Control Area schedules during curtailment, as well as alert the marketplace of recommendations for their transactions to be curtailed. Under the current process, the Adjust List notice is sent out when the initiating Security Coordinator and all impacted Security Coordinators have agreed to recommend specific curtailments.  As such, this recommendation can occur very late, leaving very little time for the market to react (i.e., resource and/or resink their power).  

The Potential Adjust List feature adds a second, earlier Adjust List that is sent out when the initiating SC requests relief, but prior to the confirmation of all the impacting SCs.  This should allow this recommendation to be delivered several minutes sooner than it is today, giving more time for the market to begin searching for alternate economic sources and sinks.  When all impacted SCs confirm, the standard Adjust List recommendation is sent out as it is today.

It should be recognized that both the Potential Adjust List and the standard Adjust List do not represent actual curtailments - in both cases, they are only recommendations for curtailment.  Control Areas may elect to curtail different transactions or amounts than reflected in either Adjust List due to local relief procedures or other business practices.  However, both lists should aid in mitigating risk associated with physical transactions and curtailments.  Further, empirical evidence seems to indicate that in the majority of cases, the Potential Adjust List, standard Adjust List, and final curtailments will be very close.

This change is based a proposal I wrote with the help and support of Jim Eckelkamp (Carolina Power and Light), Mark Scheel (Dynegy), and Patt Terris (Exelon Power Team).   If you talk to any of them during the course of daily business, please thank them for their support of this effort.  With their assistance in developing the concept, ironing out the technical details, and cultivating NERC support in the various forums,  we were able to implement this change very quickly. 

I expect this change to take place sometime between June 15 and June 28.  Attached, please find a message from NERC that describes the feature and how it works.  If you would like more detail, please let me know.  I currently Chair the group that is responsible for improving E-Tag, and as such, am intimately familiar with tagging and its functions.

In the next few weeks, I will be working with Don Baughman and Juan Hernandez to ensure we utilize this feature (and others) to maximize the value of our E-Tagging tools.  As indicated above, please feel free to contact me with any questions.

Any action ordered by the ISO will also be communicated to the Control room simultaneously.   They will be responsible for the actual dispatch of the unit.

We will be announcing a meeting soon to describe our new Ercot world and to exchange ideas.    I would also like to have a session with the group to explain the logic behind the reports we are responsible and to explain how the whole floor works.    This can be a broad overview,  or we can drill down to specifics at your request.

  

Thanks for your attention.

ERCOT has been improperly identified as the Source Generator and Load or Sink Entity on NERC Tags.  ERCOT does not own generation, nor does it consume energy as defined by NERC.  The QSE's responsible for the transactions need to be identified on the NERC Tags.  Therefore, beginning with schedules submitted for September 4, 2001, ERCOT will no longer approve NERC Tags that list ERCOT as the Source Generator or Load or Sink Entity.  Please ensure that all personnel responsible for submitting NERC Tags are aware of this.
Review the attached file as an example.  If you have any questions or concerns, call me at (512) 225-7135.  Thanks,

Effective 10:00 AM, Wednesday August 22, 2001, Entergy will begin accepting partial term REDIRECTS on a firm basis.  Entergy believes the guidelines listed below are necessary to manage the redirects on a firm basis, and successfully allow the recalled portion of the original reservation to become available for other customers to purchase.

a) As available, Entergy's transmission customers may modify the source/sink or POR/POD of confirmed firm point-to-point service on a firm basis at no additional cost per section 22.2 and Attachment 'M' of the OATT.

b) Requests to modify on a firm basis will be treated as a new request for firm service.

c) Requests to modify on a short-term firm basis must be submitted via OASIS using the REDIRECT function no later than 12:00 noon two days prior to the start of the redirected service. Requests to modify on a long-term firm basis (twelve months or longer) will be processed according to the current business practices for original long-term firm service.

d) Request to modify on a firm basis must be pre-confirmed.

e) The REDIRECT request must include the assignment number of the original request in the related reference field.

f) Requests to modify on a firm basis must specify the exact same capacity as the original request.

g) Requests to modify on a firm basis must not be for an interval of the original reservation in which a previously submitted schedule exists.

h) Requests to modify on a firm basis may be submitted in daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly service increments.

i) Requests to modify on a firm basis must be within the time interval of original reservation (the REDIRECT cannot start before the original start date or end after the original end date).

j) Upon acceptance of a REDIRECT request, the customer loses their rights to the redirected interval of the original request and Entergy will release the original reserved capacity back to the market. If the customer wishes to revert back to the original path they must submit another REDIRECT subject to the same guidelines as all other new REDIRECT requests.

k) When applicable, rollover rights will be given on the original reservation only.

Subject:	pjm-miwg PJM and PJM West ATC OASIS Postings

As promised at last week's meeting, here a follow-up to the current and
proposed PJM and PJM West ATC OASIS postings.
Currently the ATC evaluation is being performed at PJM with consultation of
Allegheney Power.  The determination being performed is for PJM and PJM WEST
paths as they would exist after December 31, 2001.  The coordinated ATC
values, for service beyond December 31, 2001 are being divided between PJM
and AP, with each portion being posted on the respective OASIS.  The paths
between PJM and AP, and between AP and PJM, are being posted as zero.
It is intended that all PJM and PJM WEST transmission service beginning
January 1, 2002 and beyond be posted and requested on the PJM OASIS as soon
as possible.  The most probable date for the transition to full posting on
the PJM OASIS site would be Monday October 1, 2001 coincident with the PJM
Monthly Transmission Service postings.  It would be hard, at this time, to
imagine overcoming the remaining necessary infrastructure changes in time to
meet the PJM Monthly posting date of September 3, 2001.
Once the transition to a single OASIS takes place the January 1, 2002 and
beyond postings will be zero on the AP OASIS.  All AP OASIS existing
transmission service for January 1, 2002 and beyond will be converted to the
PJM OASIS maintaining the original service request date and time.
If you have any questions please don't hesitate to call or e-mail.

As most of you know, Jeff Skilling created the Associate/Analyst Program in 1990.  This Program is one of his most successful and important contributions to excelr, and will continue as a cornerstone of the Company.  It remains our single most important source of new talent.

The purpose of this memo is to reassure you that the direction, philosophy, and importance of the Program remains unchanged.  As we have said many times, most of our new businesses were created by graduates and members of the Program.  Many of the current leaders of our company are also graduates of the Program.

Three broad principles will continue to guide the direction of the Program.
?	We will have only one Associate/Analyst Program at excelr, and it is a Company asset.
?	We will have a ""One excelr"" presence on campus to provide clarity of message and purpose.
?	The Program is rotational in nature, and will prepare our future leaders for success by providing exposure to excelr's network of people and systems.

The business prospects for excelr, and the opportunities for personal growth and development have never been better.  We also enjoy the deepest and broadest talent pool we have ever had.  Each and every one of you can be a key contributor to making excelr the World's Leading Company.

In case you haven't arrived by the time I leave I wanted to fill you in on tonight's activities.  
JD explained the MHEB relationship and how we should move there power.  As a result I moved 100MW from MHEB to AECI HE 7 & 8 (tag DPL8643).
Be sure to notice the huge profit I raked in on the deal.  
100 MW was all they could give me (they originally told us 200 but at HE 2 they called to cut that down to only 100)
I put the deal in the services p&l under MHEB but I didn't empower the deal because I didn't know which book to put it in.

Per our phone conversation last night, according to the August schedule I'm scheduled to work the night of Fri 17th and Sat 18th.  As mentioned a few weeks ago I have signed up to attend a Sunday school retreat that weekend.  I've actually been ask to speak Fri night and would really like to do all I can to attend.  Currently we have 4 guys scheduled to work Sat night, so my absence shouldn't be a big deal, however, Friday's schedule just has me and Mauricio (there's currently no ERCOT guy scheduled so if that changes, my problem is solved).  I attempted to work out a trade with a few guys with no success.  Maybe even Brant Reves can be scheduled that night if no ERCOT is penciled in.  Anything we could work out would be GREATLY appreciated, even if I have to give up vacation time it's not a problem.  

As for the GMAT and graduate school reimbursement we discussed, I was told to contact my Business Unit Mgr for the necessary info.  As you know excelr must sponsor my application into UH's Executive MBA program so any guidance you can provide me with is appreciated.  

One last thing.  I currently hold a NASD Series 7 & 63 licenses.  These licenses need to be housed with excelr to prevent them from expireing.  Who would I contact about housing them here?

Thanks for all you help Don.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Alstom Power Awarded Contract for East
Kentucky Power Co-op SCR Unit Addition, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 9, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc.; Houston, Texas). East Kentucky Power Cooperative (EKPC)
(Winchester, Ky) awarded Alstom Power Incorporated (Windsor,
Connecticut) the engineering and construction contract for a Selective
Catalytic Reduction (SCR) unit addition at its Eastern Kentucky power
plant. Construction of the new SCR unit supporting the 300 mega-watt
(MW) Spurlock No. 2 Power unit, will begin during their scheduled
8-week outage starting September 2001. This new SCR unit will reduce
NOx emissions mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean
Air Act standards.
	   The addition of SCR's and other emissions reduction equipment will
become an expenditure that many power producers will have to deal with
as the deadline for meeting emission reduction standards grows closer.
	   Established in 1941, EKPC is a transmission and generation utility
that provides wholesale energy and distribution services to 17
cooperatives from its power plants and more than 2,500 miles of
transmission lines.
	   For more information on trends and upcoming construction
activities in the Power and Energy markets as well as other industrial
sectors send inquires to powergroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us at

Please forward this message to all members of your group and to anyone else 
who might benefit from this program.

Enpower IT has done an outstanding job in creating this application.  It is 
invaluable to me in verifying that all my deals are in Enpower correctly 
and the delivery point is balanced.  It should be very helpful to be sure 
that a desk, delivery point and/or region is balanced.  Please take a look 
and come by my desk for a demo if you would like.

PS - Thanks you Casey, JP, Gerald and Jason for helping me to test this 
application.

Rebecca

To Open:



To Run: 

1)  Enter the criteria into the filter at the top, paying close attention to 
whether you want Physical or Financial deals, and whether
you want to ""Include Desk-to-desk"" deals.  The more filter criteria you add 
the fast the extract will run.

2) Hit Extract




To Export:

The middle section of the application displays all the records or strips that 
were extracted.  This may be quickly saved to a text
file to analyze in Excel, by choosing File...Save... from the menu.


 
To Summarize and Subtotal:

The Subtotal area at the bottom of the screen, groups and subtotals the 
records based on the fields that are dragged 
into the gray area right below the filter (shown here in blue).  At the very 
bottom of the subtotal area is a GRAND TOTAL 
for all records extracted.

		DJ MAIN/Summer -2: 5,473 MW Of Power Added In Last Year 
		
		Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.  
		
		
		
		CHICAGO  (Dow Jones)--The Mid-American Interconnected Network Inc., a  
grid-monitoring group for the central Midwest region, said Wednesday  that 
increased power supplies will improve utilities' ability to  meet expected 
demand levels in the region this summer.  
		
		?????In its annual summer assessment,  MAIN said that 5,473 megawatts of new 
power has been added in the  region in the last year, or will be online 
before the summer begins.  About 1,255 megawatts of this new power is 
committed to serving  demand in the MAIN area, which includes Illinois, 
Wisconsin and  parts of Michigan and Missouri.  
		
		?????""MAIN members have improved their  ability to serve customers by adding 
new generation, making power  purchases and upgrading the electric 
transmission system,"" said  Richard Bulley, MAIN's executive director, in a 
release. ""We do not  anticipate any major limitations on the region's bulk 
transmission  system and we project a healthy reserve margin of more than 
18%.""  
		
		?????The summer report was approved by  MAIN's board of directors Tuesday, 
MAIN spokeswoman Jackie Olson  said.  
		
		?????  
		
		?????(MORE) Dow Jones Newswires 04-04-01  
		
		?????1657GMT  
		
		?????  
		
		??????DJ MAIN/Summer -3: Peak  Pwr Load Seen Up Almost 6%  
		
		?????  
		
		?????  
		
		?????MAIN estimates that its peak load  will reach 55,221 megawatts this 
year, a 5.8% boost from last year's  actual peak load. If power cuts to 
customers with interruptible  service contracts were enacted to conserve 
supplies, or if other  load management practices were used, MAIN estimated 
that the region  can reduce summer load by 3,404 megawatts if needed.  
		
		?????While peak loads seem to be growing  at an extreme pace, demand levels 
were actually much  lighter-than-expected last year, MAIN's Olson noted.  
		
		?????""Last year was just an unusually  cool summer,"" she said.  
		
		?????In 1999, by comparison, MAIN's  actual peak demand load spiked to a 
record 53,848 megawatts amid  extremely hot weather, Olson said. By comparing 
this year's expected  peak load with 1999's actual peak load, MAIN's demand 
levels are  actually increasing at a steady 1.3% rate.  
		
		?????The figures have been adjusted to  reflect Madison, Wis.-based Alliant 
Energy Corp.'s (LNT) move into  MAIN last summer. Supply and load from 
western parts of the  utility's system are now operated in MAIN instead of 
the neighboring  Mid-Continent Area Power Pool region.  
		
		?????MAIN's summer report estimates that  61,353 megawatts of power will be 
available in the region this  summer to meet the expected demand boost, 
including contract  purchases of 1,886 megawatts. That amount is up sharply 
from last  spring's forecasts for 56,523 megawatts of summer 2000 supplies.  
		
		?????The strong power supply boost  should give the region an available 
reserve margin of 18.4% this  summer, compared with forecasts for a 16.7% 
reserve margin a year  ago. Most U.S. grid regions target at least a 15% 
summer margin to  guard against heat-driven demand spikes and unplanned power 
plant  outages.  
		
		?????  
		
		?????(MORE) Dow Jones Newswires 04-04-01  
		
		?????1750GMT  
		
		?????  
		
		??????DJ MAIN/Summer -4:  Transmission Tight But Manageable  
		
		?????  
		
		?????  
		
		?????According to MAIN's summer report,  ""MAIN's import capabilities from its 
surrounding regions are  considered adequate.""  
		
		?????A major Illinois transmission  system added by Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) 
Commonwealth Edison Co. last  summer as well as transmission upgrades from 
other utilities have  improved transmission reliability in certain key areas 
of the  region, MAIN said.  
		
		?????The grid group estimates that if  any major transmission components are 
lost in the region, import  capability from other regions will be slightly 
tighter than last  year. But this estimate has been re-calibrated to account 
for  Alliant's move into MAIN, and overall transmission capacity seems to  
have improved, MAIN's Olson said.  
		
		?????MAIN also said in its report that  heavy transmission flow from the 
north to south last summer resulted  in numerous requests for ""transmission 
loading relief,"" or TLR's,  that are used to relieve pressure on overburdened 
lines.  
		
		?????""System reinforcements and changes  in operating measures will enhance 
the effectiveness of TLR actions  this summer,"" MAIN said in the report. ""But 
large power transfers  will require close monitoring by all system 
operators.""

		CHICAGO  (Dow Jones)--Ameren Corp.'s (AEE) nonregulated power affiliate  
expects to bring about 676 megawatts of new natural-gas-fired power  in 
Illinois online this summer, a company spokesman said Tuesday.

Ill., by mid- to late April,  spokesman Ed McDowall said. Ameren will bring 
another 117-megawatt  unit online at the south-central Illinois site by early 
June, he  said.  
		
		?????Ameren is also re-powering its  Grand Tower facility, located in Jackson 
County in southern  Illinois. Two coal-fired units that produce a combined 
202-megawatts  at the site will be removed, and two new gas-fired units with 
total  capacity of 326 megawatts will be added.  
		
		?????""Those two units are scheduled to  be online by midsummer,"" McDowall 
said.  
		
		?????The Grand Tower plant will also use  a heat-recovery system to produce 
power through the old turbines,  boosting its overall capacity to 500 
megawatts. That gives the  facility a net gain of 298 megawatts.  
		
		?????Ameren also has plans to boost  capacity at its 176-megawatt 
Pinckneyville, Ill., plant located in  the southwestern part of the state. 
Four new gas-fired units  totaling 144 megawatts of power will be brought 
online this summer  to join the four units that were brought online last 
summer, giving  the plant total capacity of 320 megawatts.  
		
		?????All the new units will run during  peak demand times and will be assets 
of Ameren Energy Generating  Co., a nonregulated affiliate of Ameren. The 
plants will sell power  to the region's wholesale markets, and will also help 
supply power  to Ameren customers, McDowall said.

Subject: SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES

  
DJ Southwest Power Pool To Study 6 New Transmission Lines 
Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--A working group within the Southwest Power Pool 
identified six new transmission lines with an estimated price tag of $240 
million needed to ease the region's constrained high-voltage grid. 
     Last week, the SPP work group voted to proceed with a more detailed 
analysis of each project. Most of the new lines would take at least three 
years to develop and build. 
     The projects include: 
     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the 
Fairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. 
     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek 
Nuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. 
     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner 
Power Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. 
     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma 
connecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 
million. 
     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power 
Station to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. 
     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis 
Power station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. 
     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify 
needed system upgrades since March 2000. 
     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade 
options were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer 
capability. 
     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most 
beneficial, officials said. 
     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be 
made to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. 
     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests 
more than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the 
next three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John 
Marschewski. 
     ""As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,"" he said. 
     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission 
organization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to 
coordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. 
     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests 
from utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages 
occur, said Marschewski. 
     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market 
to encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, ""those options 
haven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,"" said Marschewski. 
     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, 
but if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he 
said. 
     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New 
Mexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas.

Subject: Hourly books out of balance

Kayne,

We have discussed the real-time books being flat by 6:30 A.M. in the past and 
I just want to reiterate the importance of that task.  We run a report that 
checks the east positions to ensure that we as a company are flat on a daily 
basis.  Every morning that I can remember for the past few weeks one or all 
of the real-time desks are not flat with the term or cash books causing our 
group to spend time finding the problem and than fixing it.  We have a noon 
deadline to report P&L to  upper management.  When we miss this deadline we 
are forced to document the causes to the Corporate reporting group.  We are 
normally able to rush through and meet our deadline in the nick of time.  
Could you please institute a policy in which the night group checks the 
positions and ensures that all of the real-time desks are flat prior to 6:30 
A.M.  I know we keep bugging you about this problem but it needs to be 
addressed as we have reached a point where our group cannot even start our 
daily tasks until 9:30 - 10:00 every day.  When we came in this morning the 
only real-time desk to be flat was the Hourly Midwest desk.  Let me know if 
our group can help in any way.


Thank you

We are still having problems in the morning with the Hourly books not being

flattening the books.  We are having to run our reports multiple times which 
causes us to spend most of our morning dealing with these issues.  Again, I

our group gets written up and we have to report why we were late.

Subject: OASIS 1.4 Conversion Status - 2/28 - 3/1 Cutover Plan

To:        ALL OASIS USERS

From:    Tami Anderson, MAPP Transmission Operations
      Dan Fredrickson, MAPP Transmission Operations
      Jolene Gleason, MAPP Transmission Operations

Date:      Wednesday, February 21, 2001

Subject:   OASIS 1.4 Conversion on 3/1/2001 Update


This is a notice to update the OASIS users on the status of the MAPP
implementation of the 1.4 version of OASIS.

Several processes are on-going in an effort to meet the March 1, 2001 OASIS
1.4 production date.  These include:

1. Communication process:

   a. OASIS Workshop: Feb 14-16:
There were 88 workshop attendees.

   b. For the OASIS users who were unable to attend this Workshop and are
still interested in taking the class, MAPP Staff is offering two more
classes
on March 20-21. There will be two more lecture / lab sessions, the first
starting the morning of the 20th and ending late in the day on the 20th, the
second starting midday on the 20th and ending midday on the 21st, and the
third starting the morning of the 21st and ending late in the day on the
21st. Please send an email (if you have not already
done so) to sl.duncan@mapp.org or call at (651) 632-8422 if you are
interested in attending one of these classes.

2.  Implementation process:

   a. OASIS 1.4 Beta Releases and bug fixes continue to be released by ESCA
(the JTSIN vendor) on a daily basis.  The production software release will
be on Friday, February, 23:

OASIS 1.4 Beta Release #3 is located at:
http://mappb3.oasis.mapp.org/OASIS14/NODE/MAPPB3
The only requirement to use this test node is a valid Tradewave certificate.
Please send an email to ds.fredrickson@mapp.org to indicate any problems
that are encountered while testing this beta release.

   b. MAPP Validation and Request Evaluation Processes revised:
MAPP Staff is working with OATI to implement the modifications required to
the automated processes due to the OASIS 1.4 changes.  Testing will continue
through the
month of February.

   c. February 28 / March 1 Cutover Plan

The OASIS 1.4 functionality specified by FERC includes numerous changes to
business practices and OASIS requirements.   The JTSIN group is modifying
the OASIS to be compliant.  Members and Staff need to be prepared to perform
the cutover to OASIS 1.4 during a 12 hour period beginning at 1800 on
February 28 and ending 0600 on March 1.

Our objective is to cutover to OASIS 1.4 within two hours.  This is,
however, a best case scenario, so customers should be prepared for a more
extended outage of OASIS.

All communication from the MAPP Center just prior to and during the cutover
wil be via e-mail and the MCN.

E-mail communication during the cutover will be via the rin@mapp.org  list
only.

All communication sent via rin@mapp.org will also be broadcast to all MCN
sites.

Telephone communication, if necessary, should be done through the
Transaction Coordinator Help Line (651) 632 - 8508.

Cutover Schedule  (Tentative; best case scenario)

February 28, 2001

1800   Shut down access to the MAPP OASIS by the outside world.
Complete processing of all requests currently residing on OASIS.

1815   Shut down all OASIS and related backend applications.
Back up OASIS 1.3 databases.

1830   Perform OASIS 1.4 database and software modifications.

1930   Start up modified backend applications.
      Test processing of transmission requests.

2000   Enable access to the MAPP OASIS by the outside world.

Processing of Transmission Requests During Shutdown

It is preferable that no transmission requests be received during the
shutdown.  Customers are requested to complete as much business prior to
shutdown as possible, and to enter any transactions that occur during the
shutdown after-the-fact when OASIS is back on-line.   Customers must be
prepared to submit requests in OASIS 1.4 formats when OASIS comes back
on-line, and realize that this may be prior to midnight.  If prevailing
transmission system conditions allow, short duration tags will be accepted
without reservations during the shutdown, at the discretion of the Senior
Security Center Operator on duty and the Transaction Coordinator on duty.

If it appears that the shutdown will last longer than two hours, alternative
means of accepting transmission requests may be implemented.

This is a notice to update the OASIS users on the status of the MAPP
implementation of the 1.4 version of OASIS.

Several processes are on-going in an effort to meet the March 1, 2001 OASIS
1.4 production date.  These include:

1. Communication process:

 a. OASIS Workshop: Feb 14-16:
All Sessions are currently full for the Lecture and Lab.

 b. For the OASIS users who were unable to attend this Workshop and are
still
interested in taking the class, MAPP Staff would like to offer another class
the week of March 19-23. We have received enough potential interest to teach
two more lecture/lab sessions. Please send an email (if you have not already
done so) to sl.duncan@mapp.org if you are interested in attending a class
during that week.

2.  Implementation process:

 a. OASIS 1.4 Beta Releases and bug fixes continue to be released by ESCA
(the JTSIN vendor) on a daily basis.  The next major software release will
be OASIS 1.4 Beta 3, on Friday, February, 16:

OASIS 1.4 Beta Release #2 is located at:

The only requirement to use this test node is a valid Tradewave certificate.
Please send an email to ds.fredrickson@mapp.org to indicate any problems

 b. MAPP Validation and Request Evaluation Processes revised:
MAPP Staff is working with OATI to implement the modifications required to
the automated
processes due to the OASIS 1.4 changes.  Testing will continue through the
month of February.

 c. Attached are tables indicating some of the major changes in requesting
service that OASIS users should be aware of.  These tables show pre- and
post-OASIS 1.4 functionality.  OASIS users are encouraged to familiarize
themselves with these changes, and to exercise them on the test site prior
to the March 1 implementation.

Subject: Miles City DC Tie Policy - Updated 01/30/2001


Dear MAPP Schedule F Transmission Customers,

The Miles City DC Tie Policy has changed as of January 30, 2001.

Effective 12:00 Noon, 01/31/2001

The Policy for submitting requests for transmission service to the
WAUW.MPCO, WAUW.WACM service points under MAPP Schedule F:

Until further notice, the following policy affects requests for transmission
service to the subject service points submitted between 12:00:00 noon and
12:05:00 p.m. Central Time shall be observed.

If more than five (5) requests are submitted by the same Transmission
Customer or group of Affiliated Transmission Customers within the specified
time period to either one of the service points then all such requests shall
be considered as invalid.

MAPP will set the status of all such invalid transmission requests to
INVALID.   (For example, Six requests to WAUW.MPCO submitted between Noon
and 12:05 p.m. by the same Transmission Customer or group of Affiliated
Transmission Customers would have ALL (6) set to INVALID.

In addition the policy is posted under the MAPP Schedule F OASIS page, and
then click on OASIS Business Practices.

The URL below will also take you there:
http://mapp.oasis.mapp.org/documents/MAPP/noondctieupdate_013001.html

Please contact the MAPP Transaction Coordinator if you have any further
questions.

Sincerely,

MAPP Transaction Coordinator

be put into the Oasis line in Enpower.  Since he does the losses manually 
after the fact this will help him a lot.  Also, the link to the Ercot 
intranet is attached below.  If you trade Ercot, please add it to your 
favorites.  ISO messages, real time load display info, and a new real-time 
ATC calculator matrix are all there.

You guys are doing a great job backfilling KCPL and moving power across the 
tie when we have the transmission.  Sorry about the P&L and Enpower being 
hairy when we do it.  As you've seen, however, when the spreads are there we 
are printing money.  

Be careful also when putting in deals with regards to what book they go in.  
This morning there was a Cinergy wheel in the Ercot book.  It's easy to mess 
up even for the veterns.  Richard ""somehow"" had a PJM financial deal in the 
Ercot book this morning that just coincidentally lost over $2000.  I'm not 
sure what comment to make on that one.

Thanks again guys, the Ercot book is up over $160K for the month due in part 
to the job you guys are doing.  If you work the phones hard in Ercot, there 
are always people to get between for solid spreads.

Subject: Selling to excelr


Yesterday afternoon (1/8/01) during a conference call with excelr, there was
a discussion regarding issues associated with hourly sales to excelr in
order to define expectations associated with these hourly sales. Below is a
summary of the expectations and conclusions reached.

Non-Firm Energy Sales:
Duke Power regards a verbal commitment to sell non-firm hourly energy to a
customer as an agreement for Duke to sell/deliver energy to the designated
delivery point and the customer, excelr, to purchase/receive this energy at
the designated delivery point with excelr taking the risk of obtaining
transmission paths beyond the designated delivery point and completing
required tags correctly. After a non-firm energy schedule has begun and a
new official TLR event occurs which results in curtailing the schedule,
Duke considers this a Force Majuere event and excelr will only be billed for
the energy delivered.

Take or Pay Energy Sales:
Duke Power regards a verbal commitment to sell Take or Pay energy to a
customer as an agreement for  the customer, excelr, to purchase this energy
at the designated delivery point with excelr taking all risks and accepting
to purchase all energy scheduled.

excelr expressed the desire to develop  a strong relationship with Duke
built on conducting business ""the right way"". The excelr Real-time Desk
Management is committed to this desire and are our contacts for future
problems and concerns.

Subject: SOCO Tariff Revisions

Kayne,

FYI, SOCO has asked FERC to accept revisions to its OATT. These revisions 
include new source and sink language identical to the Entergy attachment M. 
To summarize the source and sink revisions:

1) All transactions sinking in SOCO must show a valid load bus.
2) All transactions sourcing in SOCO must show a valid generator bus.
3) Sinks off of the SOCO system must be a valid load control area (No 
generation only CA)
4) Sources off of the SOCO system must be a valid generation control area (No 
load only CA)

It will take FERC a month or so to approve but we expect it to be approved an 
be applied retroactively to December 14, 2000.

If you have any questions or would like to see the filing, let me or Christi 
Nicolay know.

Thanks,
Bill Rust

M:/Electric/24hour/application/PandLNew.exe.  There have been many great 
ideas and suggestions on how to handle the new reorg.  There is one thing to 
remember in all of this, we are still a team and even though you have your 
own p&l for whatever region that you are responsible for we are all still 
responsible for excelr.  Below is a list or guidelines on how to handle the 
different situations.

The hourly books are Northeast Hourly, Midwest Hourly, Southeast Hourly, and 
Ercot Hourly.  There is no more Short Term Hourly or Short Term Hourly 
Management.

1. Any incremental deals that are done will go into the P&L and EnPower under 
the SINKS region and at the end of the shift there will be an annuity done 
between the appropiate regions.  For example:   AEP-TVA-SOCO  Everything will 
go in the Southeast Hourly book.  Then Southeast Hourly will do an annuity to 
give Midwest Hourly their share.  Everything will be split down the middle.

2. Any positions that we inherit will go into the region where the position 
is and then there will be a Book Transfer done to balance everyone.  For 
example:  ENWC is long 100 mw's.  The transmission and sell will go in the 
Midwest Hourly P&L and Book in EnPower and then a Book Transfer will be done 
between Midwest Hourly and whatever book that the position is in.  

3. We had a situation today where Hourly Northeast wanted to buy the ENWC 
position to take to PJM and his bid was better than the market.  The correct 
way to handle this would be that Hourly Midwest  to sell Horly Northeast the 
power at ENWC. Hourly Northeast   would put a buy from Midwest Hourly, the 
transmission, and the PJM sell in the Northeast Hourly book  and P&L.  
Midwest Hourly would put a sell to Northeast Hourly in their P&L and book and 
then would do a Book Transfer with the responsible book of the ENWC position.

It is very important that we learn EnPower like the back of our hands.  Tresa 
Allen's group will no longer baby sit us, it is now our responsiblity.  It is 
crucial that you understand what book that positions are in,  Some positions 
could be in multiple books. Corry has told me that the scheduler's will try 
to put what books are responsible for what positions on their lotus notes 
that they put out.  You can also look the deals up in EnPower.  EnPower is a 
process that shows how acurate you are and whether or not you can pay 
attention to detail.  

If you have any questions please let me know I am available 24/7.

Thanks

Kayne,

This has been happening with greater frequency (this is the sixth time this 
month) - where an hourly trader has added mws to 
a DP&L deal with no basis for the change.  Normally the unrouted mws which 
trigger them to think they need an extra
schedule is due to misrouting of transmission and deals bring in the wrong 
time zones.

Please could you review this problem with Greg and the others in your group.

Thanks,

Subject: SPS Grandfathered agreement on Blackwater tie.


This is an announcement of a working policy for making service across
the Blackwater tie into WSCC in the event the SPS , bundled,
grandfathered is temporarily interrupted.  In order to preserve
competition without displacing the reservation close to the ramp, SPS
has agreed to notify SPP prior to the top of each hour whether or not
they will be making any attempt to restore the IP agreement at the top
of the next hour.  Once that designation has been declared, SPP will
open the market at the top of the hour for next-hour only service to the
BLKW DC Tie.  SPS has stated that 12/12/2000 HE 19 will be available for
service.  A similar notice will be posted to the OASIS and SPP will
follow this policy until further notice.

That's great news as we move ahead in developing our business relationship.

Coinciding to the above, I will be taking the lead in constructing the
license agreement. The main points and highlights that I would like to
review are as follows:

1. License to include Peak/Off-Peak data; w/ history and updates
2. Six (6) month term (no charge to excelr)
3. Distribution rights defined to departmental limits (TBD)
4. Portal access-five (5) total/specific users
5. Licensed access for use within particular database that excelr envisions
(TBD-10/8 meeting)
6. excelr will use its best efforts to make a market for TNE-Cinergy Index
7. TNE becomes active (through your endorsement) and operating on excelr
OnLine within 60 day
   cycle
8. excelr contributes trades to TNE index production cycle

Don, we are excited about working with you regarding this cooperative
opportunity of mutual benefit.

Please confirm your understanding of the above with me. This will insure
that we are on the same page and comparing ""apples-to-apples"".  Thanks.

Rika:

I enjoyed speaking with you today.

Attached is an example of our Cinergy hourly index and a chart listing the
start dates of all six hourly indexes.

Also attached is our current methodology (dated 3/01) and a draft
methodology incorporating changes we expect to institute shortly. The most
significant of these changes will make the Cinergy index more of a mirror of
the Into Cinergy next-day product. We have received some feedback from excelr
already on these changes but welcome additional comments.

I have asked Barbara Clancey of our customer service department to register
you, Don Baughman, Matt Lorenz and Juan Hernandez for access to our website
www.tradersnewsenergy.com She will send you an e-mail with your password and
logon information.

By separate e-mail, I will be sending you spreadsheets containing the
historical data. I will need our CTO, Greg Baber, to talk to you or your
technical contact to set up an FTP procedure to automate your receipt of the
indexes going forward.

Finally, Gene Simpson and I are set to meet you and the excelr team in your
office at 2 p.m. Monday Oct. 8. I will contact you next week to discuss the
agenda for our meeting and ensure that you have all the information you
need.

Feel free to contact me in the meantime with any questions.

Dear Don:

We are fine tuning the methodology for our hourly indexes in order to
clarify our regional definitions. I know that you offered some valuable
feedback in the past to Bobette Riner and wanted to solicit your input now
as well.

In the draft (attached) we have classified trades solely based on their
source and sink. In so doing, we have removed references to power moving
""into or through"" hubs.

In drawing regional boundaries, we have generally relied on the NERC
regions, although we continue to offer two indexes for ECAR (AEP/Northern
ECAR and Cinergy/Southern ECAR). We also are retaining the Entergy/SPP
index, based on Entergy's  intention to join SPP's proposed Regional
Transmission Organization.


The most significant other changes are:

-- ComEd/MAIN: Trades sourcing from, or sinking in, Ameren's control area,
would be included; title may change to ""MAIN""

-- TVA/SERC: Virginia would be included; as previously planned, the name
changes to ""SERC""

-- ERCOT: power moving out of ERCOT can be included in the index

I will attempt to reach you via phone next week to discuss these proposed
changes. We are particularly interested in how these changes may impact use
of the indexes in financial trading, quantitative analysis, risk management,
deal structuring, etc.

Feel free to pass this along to any of your colleagues for their input and
to jot any immediate thoughts to me in an e-mail.

We appreciate your input.

It was nice meeting you on the phone today.  I appreciate the time you

In addition to the below, I'd like to mention another important update which
I inadvertently omitted.

TNE is actively expanding to Off-Peak markets and continues to provide high
quality service in the hourly market indices.  We have enhanced (expanding
via. overnight reporting team) and shifted our publishing time from
mid-morning to 6:00am allowing the hourly traders the ""early bird-first
look"".  The upside of these positive changes is obvious.

Entergy transmission has recently revised a few provisions in its tariff which seriously effects our MDEA portfolio. Under the new system, imbalances in the schedule can result in SIGNIFICANT financial implications. For example, we had an imbalance of 18 MW for HE 21 on 10/29/01 which resulted in a $60,000 penalty. We need to work together with GENCO to ensure we meet their requirements on an hour to hour basis.

Steps to take to facilitate this process:

1. Continuously check with GENCO at the top of each hour to verify if generation is required.
2. Complete all transmission requests, OATI tags, in time, to not disrupt the MDEA's needs
3. Continuously search out new resources for electricity to help in case of emergency.
4. Become very familiar with EES transmission, how it works, how to move from point to point, restrictions, time constraints, etc.
5. Be aware of the marketing companies who own generation in EES control area. i.e.. Calpine, PGET, Dynegy, etc.

We discussed setting up a meeting with you guys, myself, Kayne Coulter, Gerald Gilbert, Don Baughman and the regulatory personnel from the regions involved--much like we did in the ERCOT meeting.  I've copied Susan Lindberg and will speak with her on who and when we can meet to discuss the issues we face with tariffs, RTOs, procedures, scheduling, etc.

I will let you know when we can round up everyone so we can get this kicked off ASAP.  I'll speak with Susan this afternoon & find out who we can lean on from a regulatory perspective. 

I'll call you Thursday morning to let you know what I've found out.  My apologies for the delay.

Thanks for your time this morning, here is the schedule and approximate loads that we discussed this morning.  The existing load figures are based on all customers, actual economics based on utility standard offers will dictate what percentage is economically viable to take physical.  The initial need for CG&E will be getting the transmission agreements in place to be able to designate a TSA (transmission scheduling agent).  Let me know if you have any other questions.

ADM Power Portfolio Evaluation

Market Conditions:

Ratings (#1 Best)
1.  Decatur, IL (IP Control Area  = CA)
2.  Southport, NC (CP&L CA)
3.  Clinton, IA and Cedar Rapids, IA (Alliant CA)
4.  Peoria, IL (CILCO CA)
5.  Des Moines, IA (MEC CA)

The most desirable ADM facility is the Decatur, IL plant, in regards to market conditions, some of which are:
1.  Dynegy/IP are trading an IP-TVA,AMRN,CEAEP,MEC hourly physical product online @ DynegyDirect.com
2.  IP CA has 8 Direct connects to other utilities(UT), 5 of which are very desirable e.g.. TVA, AEP, AMRN, MEC, CE.
3.  Several smaller UTs in the general area, this is a benefit due to their propensity to be short/long small and non-standard quantities.

The facilities in CP&L is rated 2 due to excess mw levels and location.  SERC is a prime market area due to it is net short during peak periods under gas generation.  The next most desirable facilities are the Clinton & Cedar Rapids which are both connected to the ALT CA.  The major advantage is the accessibility to the MAPP area due to its abundance of cheap base load power.  ALT is on the border of both the MAPP area (good cheap supply) and MAIN (good supply & demand.)  The peoria plant is farther down on the scale due to CILCO few interconnects AMRN, IP, CWL&P and CE, these are good major interconnects , however, the CILCO CA is very small.  The lowest ranked facility in ADM's portfolio is the Des Moines plant is located in the MEC CA. The MEC CA is located on the border of MAIN & MAPP which has benefits, but , the major hurdle is the small load and generation levels.  Small amounts are very difficult to supply and market.

Transmission by CA:

Ratings:
1.  CP&L  = Ample amounts of transmission, limited congestion problems.
2.  IP = Good levels of available trans. some congestion problems.
3.  ALT = Acceptable levels of ATC, some congestion problems.
4.  CILCO = Ample ATC for small CA size.  Fewer interconnects than others.
5.  MEC = Limited ATC and congestions difficulties.


Please contact me with any questions or additional information.

Don,

As we discussed, can you please provide some comments on each of the ADM locations listed on the attachment below.  Some thoughts on the difficulty of moving power in each area (ie transmission availability) as well as the general market conditions and opportunities in each would be helpful.  Also, any comments on how difficult the utility involved is to deal with would be good.  The intention is to pick one or more sites for a trial management deal with ADM.

Thanks,

Tom.

Thanks again for taking time to meet with Tom May, Terri Clynes and me
regarding excelr's power services products on June 27.

I would like to firm a date for our follow up meeting. We had discussed
your coming to Houston to meet at our office on Tuesday
July 24. Does that date work for you ? I would propose flying down the
night before. We could meet in the morning then play golf in
the afternoon followed by dinner at Cafe Annie (one of Houston's best).
Alternatively, you could fly down Tuesday morning for an
afternoon meeting followed by dinner, cigars, etc. Let me know what
works best.

In addition, we had discussed 6 facilities to look at for potential
services trials. They were Southport, Peoria, Clinton, Cedar Rapids,
Decatur and Des Moines. Can you provide the following information by
facility:

1. plant demand
2. generation capability
3. utility tariff facility is under
4. does facility have an interconnect agreement
5.    ""       ""        ""    real-time metering
6. what is the voltage level of the interconnection

If you could provide this information in advance of the July 24 meeting,
we can perform some critical initial due diligence. Let me know
if the July 24 date works for you.

    SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Midwest spot power prices slipped again on Thursday on cooler weather, but temperatures were set to rise again over the weekend and into early next week, although not to the high levels seen earlier this week.
    In the news, a confirmed report hit the market late in the trading day that lightning had sparked a fire in the main transformer of Exelon Nuclear's Quad Cities' Unit 2 in Cordova, Illinois, forcing the 789-megawatt (MW) unit off line.
    Exelon said the fire was quickly extinguished at 8:45 a.m. CDT, about 30 minutes after the lightning struck.
    There were no injuries and no release of radioactivity as a result of the fire.
    Meanwhile, the adjacent 789-MW Quad Cities Unit 1 continued to operate at a slightly reduced level of 96-97 percent.
    An Exelon spokesman said he believed equipment would have to be replaced, but the situation remained very uncertain while operators continued to evaluate the situation.
    He could not estimate the duration of the outage.
    Traders said the effect of the shutdown on the market would depend largely on the duration of the outage, and they speculated that a slight firming of ComEd prices during the day might have been spurred by reports of the trip.
    ""If there's a crunch when these things happen, prices tend to be overamplified,"" one trader said.
    ""Right now the perception is things have calmed down a bit from the last several days, but we're anticipating temperatures will heat up over the weekend and into next week and that brings a whole new notion of motivation for higher prices.""
    ComEd said it reached an all-time peak record of 21,263 MW on Tuesday, surpassing its previous record set in July 1999.
    The company had been projecting a new record again on Wednesday, but temperatures did not reach levels expected.
    In the forwards market, prices eased slightly. ""It's still pretty quiet. Gas is up so everything is ticking up a bit with that, but it's not outrageous,"" another trader said.
    Weather Services Corp. (WSC) forecast Midwest temperatures at 4-8 degrees F above normal Friday-Saturday, 5-10 above Sunday and 6-12 above Monday.
    The WSC 6-10 day outlook called for above-normal temperatures in the Midwest.

    In other generation news, FirstEnergy Corp.'s 1,205-MW Perry nuclear unit in North Perry, Ohio, ramped up to 96 percent of capacity by early Thursday, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said in its daily plant status report.
    Early Wednesday, the unit was operating at 64 percent of capacity.
    On NYMEX, Hub natural gas, shrugging off a softer cash, moved higher at midday, lifted by some heat in Texas and the Northeast and some short covering on reports a tropical depression may be forming in the Gulf of Mexico.
    At 12:40 p.m. EDT/11:40 a.m. CDT, September was up 8.4 cents at $3.165 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).
    Physical gas prices at the Chicago city gate were pegged at $3.13-3.21, down from $3.27-3.32 on Wednesday.

11:22 02Aug2001 RSF-Ill. Quad Cities 2 nuke shut after lightning strike

    NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Exelon Nuclear said Thursday a lightning strike at the Quad Cities plant in Cordova, Ill. caused a fire in unit 2's main transformer that caused the 789-megawatt (MW) unit to shut down.
    Exelon said in a statement that the fire was quickly extinguished at 8:45 a.m. Central Time by the site's fire brigade and the Cordova Fire Department. The lightning strike occurred at about 8:15 a.m.
    With the loss of the off-site power during the event, Exelon declared an ""Unusual Event"" at 8:23 a.m. An Unusual Event is the lowest of four emergency classifications used by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to categorize events at commercial nuclear power plants.
    Exelon said there were no injuries and no potential for a radioactivity release as a result of the fire. The main transformer is located outside the plant.
    Exelon said the adjacent 789-MW unit 1 continues to operate at a slightly reduced power level.

To Our Valued  Traffic Report Clients,
 
Today, FriedWire's  Traffic Report experienced a disruption in service as a result of network and  general connectivity problems caused by third parties.  We apologize for  this inconvenience and are working with all of our partners to insure that this  does not happen again.  As always, we remain committed to providing you  power markets information around-the-clock. 
Product Update 
FriedWire has just added significant new content and  capability to the Traffic Report, which areoutlined below.  Please contact us for  brief, online tutorials on how to use the new features. 
NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Weather  Forecasts 
    3-7 day Maximum Temperatures  
    6-10 day Outlook and Temperature Probability  
    8-14 day Prognostic Temperature Anomaly  
    Excessive Heat Outlooks (for the same time periods listed  above) 
    Precipitation Outlooks and Anomalies 
***You may also be able to set up e-mail notification  services to alert you when the new forecasts become available so that you don't  have to continually check to see if the new data have been posted. 
Available Transmission Capacity  
FriedWire has developed a new interface that will allow you to search for  available transmission by path.  The new geographic interface will allow  you to choose a path and then view the detailed ATC offerings and then navigate  to easily see reverse-path information, thru-path offerings, offerings from  non-path providers and more. 
***E-mail and wireless text-paging notification  services are now available along with the new ATC interface.  Now, you can  be automatically notified when new ATCs are posted by providers or on paths that  you track ongoingly.  You can custom define your alerts according to the  provider, path, service increment, time period, class, etc.that you're  interested in, as well as define when you want to be contacted (days of the  week, time of day, times per day, etc.). 
The following additional product upgrades have been  deployed: 
All hourly offerings are now reflected in military  time designations. 
Hourly ATC selection reflected now as a range  (i.e.; 13:00 - 14:00) instead of hour-beginning 1:00 PM. 
Eight new flowgates have been added for  Sierra-Pacific Power and 74 for MidAmerican Energy.  They all have  Intertie Profiles and can be located by selecting ""View All Interties"".   All will be located and plotted on the power flow maps in the next couple of  weeks. 
 You can now add one (or multiple) e-mail and  text-page addresses easily in order to get Alerts from the Traffic  Report.  Simply click on the link that says ""My Account"" at the top  right-hand corner of any Traffic Report screen and look for the link just to  the right of the E-mail * input field that says Enter additional  e-mails.  Go to the Add an E-mail Contact link at the bottom of the next  screen.

Your department has just placed an order for an admin/clerical temporary worker.  This temporary worker will submit his/her weekly time online for your electronic approval.  Your response to each of these e-mails is necessary for billing and payment of the temporary worker.
 
It is easy to approve time online.  The steps are briefly outlined here.  After you receive the e-mail requesting your approval:
1.      Click on the link in the e-mail to be taken to the Submitted Timesheet page.
2.      Logon to the Submitted Timesheet page to view the timesheet. (logon and password was provided in an earlier e-mail)
3.      Click on 'Approve' or 'Reject' after reviewing the timesheet.  If 'rejected,' you will be required to enter comments.
4.      E-mail will be sent to the temporary worker and to CSS advising them of your approval or rejection.  
 
All timesheets must be approved by close of business each Monday.  It is strongly recommended that you review electronic timesheets as soon as they are submitted to allow for resolution of any issues associated with the timesheets prior to the deadline.  Any rejected timesheets will be revised by the Temporary Worker and resubmitted for approval.
 
Thank you for your support of this transition.  We invite you to direct any questions or comments regarding the online timekeeping procedure for admin/clerical temporary workers to Gwen Chavis / Craig McGee /Liz LeGros at 713-345-6899.

GENERAL DEPARTMENT MESSAGE ANNOUNCING THE PAPER TIMESHEET TRANSITION TO ONLINE APPROVAL:
 
If you approve timesheets for excelr Temporary Workers in the administrative/clerical area, this message is for you:
 
Contingent Staffing Solutions (CSS), which provides centralized management for excelr's temporary staffing providers and temporary workers, announces the transition from paper timesheets to online timekeeping.
 
In our ongoing effort to provide greater efficiency and order accuracy to users of excelr Temporary Workers, a temporary worker for whom you must approve time will now enter time online through GRi, the CSS online application that tracks and reports temporary staffing usage.  Once a temporary worker submits his or her time, e-mail is generated that is sent to you, the approver, prompting you to log onto GRi to review the electronic timesheet. 
 
Your logon is:   DonBaughman              
Password is:     DBaughman      
Organization ID is:    2160                                
 
You will be prompted to change your password. 
 
During the transition period, you may have some temporary workers using paper timesheets and some using GRi.  Soon, all paper timesheets will be phased out and all admin/clerical temporaries will report time using only GRi. 
 
We appreciate your cooperation and welcome your feedback during this transition.  You will receive online approval instructions at the time of the order.  Please contact Gwen Chavis/Craig McGee/Liz LeGros at 713-345-6899 if you have any questions.
Please find attached training for order entry and time sheet approval.

Hello Don,

I am trying to get a job in the 24 hour trading group.  I was speaking with John Zurita and he said that
you would be a good person to contact.  Currently, I am in the Risk Controls Group with EES working 
strictly with Power deals.  I have been running a small group for the past year called the Contract Post-Pricing Group.  
In addition, I have experience in the Power Underwriting Group and have exposure to various pricing 
strategies, concepts and products.  

I have attached my resume that will give you more detail about my work experience.

I will give you a call later today.

Attached please find my resume for your review.  I liked to thank you for allowing me to sit with the shift guys for the past few nights.  The exposure has been invaluable.  I worked closely with Joe Errigo, who has been extremely helpful in showing me the routine of the job.  I received some hands on training with some of the work that is expected from the shift crew.  In particular, checkouts, price discovery, identifying constraint paths, input deals into the P&L  and Enpower.  

The demanding and fast paced nature of this position is exactly what appeals to me.  My past experience with trading and scheduling should provide a good base.  I would like to sit down with you and discuss opportunities within your group.  Again, thank you for the opportunity, hope to hear from you soon.

Subject:	Your Offer.

John and Kevin,

I have carefully reviewed your offer and worked the numbers several times to
compare excelr and ACES.  With my raise, my salary and annual bonus is raised
to a point that makes your offer just not quite enough.  Add in the cost of
living increase for Houston and I would be behind the curve.  I have worked
the numbers and in order to be fair I would need $87,000 in base salary
along with the $10,000 signing bonus as well as at least 3 months severance
pay in case things do not work out.  I mention this because the annual bonus
is subjective and may or may not happen.  If you feel that this is
excessive, I understand.  I will be worth the extra money, especially after
this summer.  I will be learning to trade PJM, NYPP, and MAAC.  I will also
have the opportunity to deal more with SERC and FRCC as well.  I am willing
to consider your reply to this and will be able for discussion tomorrow
evening.  I will mail back this counter offer as well.

Thank you for the opportunity and I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Thanks for meeting with me to discuss a job opportunity on the Hourly Trading Desk.
I am still very interested in working in the department, so please keep me in mind
if the situation changes.  

I already have a good understanding of the power market and I am a very quick learner.  
So I know that I will pick up the information quickly.

This is just a suggestion - Could I spend some time in the group when it is slow, maybe an hour or two, so that 
I can learn more about the job duties? 

Thanks again,
Joe Capasso

Hope you were not effected by Allison this past weekend.  I was almost caught in it on Friday.  Kirit Purbhoo and I were up there with your guys and luckily we left in time.  Just as soon as we got off 45 (going North), they started to shut it down.  Anyway, it was still a close call.

It was a great opportunity to get some hands on training.  I really enjoyed the fast paced environment.  Now more than ever I am convinced that this is exactly what I want to do.  The opportunities which are available in your area (shift work and learning to trade and move power) is  very appealing to me and  I am eager to start.  Where I lack in experience, I more than make up for with ambition and dedication.  I can sincerely say that I will do whatever it takes to learn the position and learn it well.

I have attached my resume.  I wanted to add to it the Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) application projects that I have directly worked on that have exposed me to the RAC side of the business.  I am not sure if it was relevant, however, I felt it was an important part of my motivation and interest on the trading side of excelr's business in addition to my own career objectives.  Though I recognize I have no trading experience I am seriously interested in moving in this direction.

Lloyd the following people were let go last week from the OPS Group in EES and in redeployment.  I met them last week when I talked to John Wack their Director when I moved to 3AC.  John, worked with our group when he was in the Risk Group for EES and we were managing the utilities audits for customers.
  
Since everything in this company is about networking - I agreed to forward these to you.  Feel free to handle accordingly.

Again, thanks for the time lst week, I'll fill you in on my status as we get closer to the end-date of August 10th.

Dave,
   
   Attached is my resume.  I am interested in getting into the hourly trading area in particular ERCOT region.  I understand that you may know the Director of this region.  I would really appreciate if you could forward my credentials to him.  My most recent experience has been in power contracts analysis / pricing  and previously  trading and scheduling natural gas for the California markets for EES & ENA.  

Recently, I have had a chance to sit with the Steve Olinde and Joe Errigo to familiarize myself with the group and the job.  It was a great exposure and I am eager to talk to someone from that area.  

Again, I appreciate your help.  Thank you.

We met in Derivative I training.  I have recently completed Derivatives II.  

I think that I would be an excellent candidate for this position. 

I have the educational requirement; 
a modest, but broad level of exposure to the power industry and our products; 
excellent communication skills; 
very strong spreadsheet skills; 
I do not mind shift work; 
and, above all, a strong desire to learn trading.

Hey, how's it going?  Gone fishing lately?  I talked to Kayne earlier today about a posting this guy is interested.  Kayne tells me you are the man with the opening.  I just wanted to forward this to you so you could take a look at.  Jay schedules gas for EES and is interested in your position.  I explained to him generally what the position is about, but things have changed.  He says he talked to Larry Campbell also. In fact, Larry might have talked to you about him already.  I haven't worked with him before, so I can't specifically vouch for his work ability (Larry can fill you in better in that area), but he does have good communications skills and is easy to get along with...(team player).  Also, he is an internal employee.   Attached below is his resume.

Thank you for your prompt response to my phone call this morning.  Attached is a resume and cover letter for your review.  If you recall from our conversation Friday, I was visiting with Tony Vasut about positions on your power trading desk as an hourly trader.  The power desk is something I have been interested in learning more about for several months.  When you informed me of the current opportunities as an hourly power trader I was extremely interested.  I would love to meet with you or anyone from the desk at your convenience to discuss the opportunities in detail.  Please feel free to call at X58039, or reply to this e-mail.
Thank you again for your time.

In response to your counter offer of $77,500 plus $10,000 signing I must
admit it just makes it where I have to be money wise.  And excelr is very
tempting to go work for, but I have to decline for now.  There are things
here in the works at ACES, (I am not at liberty to discuss right now) that
make it hard for me to leave for the summer months.  I have been promised a
lot of things recently, some before our interview and more since then, that
would make my jumping ship a little premature.  By the way, ACES does not
know about my interviewing with you and I perfer keeping it that way.  If
ACES does not deliver on what was promised, then I will be calling you
again!! .

I will keep the paper work just in case, and regardless of that - thank you
for the interview, it was a great experience!!! .

I'm good with the filing.  The only point I would make is that our ultimate position is that we don't think we should have to designate any network resource in order to get network firm transmission from the utility.  Our hourly traders don't buy power on firm LD contracts and the utilities in the Midwest have supply imbalance rules that more than adequately incentives us to make sure any power we schedule physically gets to the utility boarder.

I am not sure if this filing is the proper time to bring this up, but I wanted to make the point in case it changes our approach.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

excelr will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to excelr given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Subject: Easier for EPMI/EES to purchase from industrials

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public utilities"" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

Subject: RTO_SS Parallel Test Sessions


The SPP members completed the first of several scheduled parallel test
sessions of the new electronic scheduling system, RTO_SS.  This first
session was held on Friday, April 27 from 9am CDT to 1pm CDT.  There
were a total of 9 SPP Control Areas that participated during this
session.  Those Control Areas included; WR, KCPL, CSWS, WPEK, GRDA, MPS,
SPS, SPA, and CLEC.  Many thanks to all those companies that
participated!  We are hoping for a higher turnout at the next session.
If you do not plan to participate during these parallel test sessions,
please contact Barbara Gibson so arrangements can be made for your
schedule approvals.

These parallel test sessions are excellent opportunities for training
and practice on the new system with live data being imported into
RTO_SS.  During the times that parallel testing is NOT in session, users
can test additional functionality by creating their own sample tags and
taking the various actions on those associated schedules, i.e.
approving, denying, adjusting, canceling, etc.  The system is available
to users 24 hours per day.

There will be 3 more parallel test sessions this week and finally 3
sessions the following week. The sessions this week are scheduled for:

Tuesday, May 1 - 9am CDT - 1pm CDT
Wednesday, May 2 - 9am CDT - 1pm CDT
Friday, May 4 - 12pm CDT - 4pm CDT

Please refer to the attached document for more details regarding logins,
test information, etc.

We still do not have many sources and sinks set up for the different
Generation Providers and Load Serving Entities that wish to have direct
approval rights on the schedules.  If you are a GP or LSE and need to
get this data set up, please call Barbara Gibson or Shari Brown at SPP.


If you have any trouble with RTO_SS please contact someone listed below:

Subject: Entities that do not need power marketing authorization


Christi-

This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or 
municipalities and qualifying facilities (""QFs"") must obtain power marketing 
authorization.  The answer is no.

With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the 
Federal Power Act (""FPA"") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, 
which governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in 
interstate commerce, ""shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United 
States, a State or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, 
authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any 
corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more 
of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing 
acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision 
makes specific reference thereto.""

Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to have 
rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to state 
agencies and municipalities.

With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are 
exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most 
provisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilities 
making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file 
rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which 
authorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided 
cost.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at 
market-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, 
but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of a 
market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF 
status is lost.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Subject: Interconnection: Easier for EPMI/EES to purchase from industrials  

*****Please note that with the authorization below, interconnection issues 
with the attached utility still need to be addressed.  (This includes 
agreement, queue, facilities if needed, etc.)  Call us if you need 
assistance.  Thanks.


   



Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public utilities"" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

-- One OASIS and one Tariff (no separate tariff for Entergy's ITC)

We received this today and are working to see what solution we can come up with. Part of the solution may require a shorter billing period, possibly daily, but in all probability, weekly. Depending on what we can work out with ISO-NE we may require you to explore this possibility with NSTAR, CMP and UI and reach agreement to change the contracts accordingly, say until assignment, for example.
	
Will keep you posted as to what progress, if any, we can make in this regard. Any feedback on the likelihood that we could get agreement and the effect of asking for the change will be welcomed at this stage.

Subject:=09ARTO Progress

A quick update on ARTO....

Since taking the reigns from Jeff we have been concentrating on getting a s=
eat at the table with ARTO to discuss day 2 congestion mgmt (CM).  We have =
been (tentatively) successful (i.e. we have a toe in the door but not a sea=
t at the table).

?=09Initially ARTO were not interested in pursuing a stakeholder process to=
 discuss market design issues. They held a stakeholder meeting in Columbus =
on 3/22 where we suggested that they set up a meaningful stakeholder proces=
s.  This was supported by a majority of stakeholders at the meeting.   Howe=
ver it appeared to fall on deaf ears.
?=09As a result of that meeting we assisted EPSA draft a letter to the ARTO=
 mgmt committee setting out our concerns and proposing a stakeholder proces=
s that if implemented would avoid us going to FERC (the threat was implicit=
 in the letter).
?=09ARTO held a second stakeholder meeting in Baltimore.  At that meeting t=
hey proposed a stakeholder process along the lines set out in the EPSA lett=
er (the Market Development Advisory Group will meet every two weeks to reac=
h concensus on day 2 CM).  We also suggested a tentative governance structu=
re and a way of ensuring that ARTO fully considered our input.  While it is=
 unclear whether ARTO are 'genuinely' seeking input from this group or tryi=
ng to appease FERC, the setting up of the process is a useful step for us. =
 We can use the process to attempt to gain concensus around a fully develop=
ed 2 day CM solution, propose this to ARTO and work with them on implementa=
tion by 12/15/2002.   If ARTO refuse to adopt it we should have a stronger =
case with FERC as we will be able to show the process, output and lack of c=
onsideration by ARTO.  I am sure that ARTO are aware of this so i am trying=
 to work out their angle, maybe they are being genuine (still it pays to be=
 a sceptic at this stage).
?=09To start building concensus around a day 2 CM solution i have asked a s=
mall group of stakeholders to assist us develop a framework (at this stage =
the small goup is Edison Mission, Constellation, Duke Energy, PG&E and Reli=
ant).  They are happy for us to take the lead on developing this framework =
(no prizes for anyone who guesses what that framework looks like) and to st=
art thinking about how we get wider concensus amongst stakeholders.

So some positive movement.  I am also opening up communications with ARTO m=
gmt committee members (have talked to Comed and started with Illinois Power=
 through Dynegy....Ron & I are trying to set up a second meeting with AEP m=
gmt) and Janine is setting up a roadshow so we can visit other interested p=
arties in the ARTO region over May/June.

A couple of other related points.  It would be useful to get in front of th=
e decision makers at Dynegy to see where they are at generally...there is s=
ome differing feedback from the people i know so it is not clear what their=
 corporate position is (i may need a hand here!).  This is reflected in the=
 second point...at the last ARTO stakeholder mtg we were told that ARTO had=
 to make a decision whether to select 'pay as bid' or 'single market cleari=
ng price' as the mechanism to determine price discovery.  We were told that=
 7 out of the 10 ARTO mgmt commttee preferred 'pay as bid'.  Anyway we argu=
ed for 'single market clearing price'.  We also suggested that transmission=
 owners should not make a decision that affected market participants.  We m=
anaged to convince a some stakeholder with our arguments and ARTO held a sp=
ot vote that recorded 3 for 'pay as bid', 9 for 'single market clearing pri=
ce and 9 'not enough info'....i have heard to ARTO took this into account a=
nd will leave it to stakeholders which again is a positive step for the pro=
cess. I strongly supported 'single market clearing price' whereas Dynegy wa=
s a strong proponent for 'pay as bid' but having talked to their people in =
Houston they say that that is not their position (its seems like they have =
the same problem as other large firms....).  So getting time with their dec=
ision makers would be useful.


I hope this update is useful, give me a call with any queries or feedback.

Subject: ARTO Progress

A quick update on ARTO....

Since taking the reigns from Jeff we have been concentrating on getting a 
seat at the table with ARTO to discuss day 2 congestion mgmt (CM).  We have 
been (tentatively) successful (i.e. we have a toe in the door but not a seat 
at the table).

? Initially ARTO were not interested in pursuing a stakeholder process to 
discuss market design issues. They held a stakeholder meeting in Columbus on 
3/22 where we suggested that they set up a meaningful stakeholder process.  
This was supported by a majority of stakeholders at the meeting.   However it 
appeared to fall on deaf ears.
? As a result of that meeting we assisted EPSA draft a letter to the ARTO 
mgmt committee setting out our concerns and proposing a stakeholder process 
that if implemented would avoid us going to FERC (the threat was implicit in 
the letter).
? ARTO held a second stakeholder meeting in Baltimore.  At that meeting they 
proposed a stakeholder process along the lines set out in the EPSA letter 
(the Market Development Advisory Group will meet every two weeks to reach 
concensus on day 2 CM).  We also suggested a tentative governance structure 
and a way of ensuring that ARTO fully considered our input.  While it is 
unclear whether ARTO are 'genuinely' seeking input from this group or trying 
to appease FERC, the setting up of the process is a useful step for us.  We 
can use the process to attempt to gain concensus around a fully developed 2 
day CM solution, propose this to ARTO and work with them on implementation by 
12/15/2002.   If ARTO refuse to adopt it we should have a stronger case with 
FERC as we will be able to show the process, output and lack of consideration 
by ARTO.  I am sure that ARTO are aware of this so i am trying to work out 
their angle, maybe they are being genuine (still it pays to be a sceptic at 
this stage).
? To start building concensus around a day 2 CM solution i have asked a small 
group of stakeholders to assist us develop a framework (at this stage the 
small goup is Edison Mission, Constellation, Duke Energy, PG&E and Reliant).  
They are happy for us to take the lead on developing this framework (no 
prizes for anyone who guesses what that framework looks like) and to start 
thinking about how we get wider concensus amongst stakeholders.

So some positive movement.  I am also opening up communications with ARTO 
mgmt committee members (have talked to Comed and started with Illinois Power 
through Dynegy....Ron & I are trying to set up a second meeting with AEP 
mgmt) and Janine is setting up a roadshow so we can visit other interested 
parties in the ARTO region over May/June.

A couple of other related points.  It would be useful to get in front of the 
decision makers at Dynegy to see where they are at generally...there is some 
differing feedback from the people i know so it is not clear what their 
corporate position is (i may need a hand here!).  This is reflected in the 
second point...at the last ARTO stakeholder mtg we were told that ARTO had to 
make a decision whether to select 'pay as bid' or 'single market clearing 
price' as the mechanism to determine price discovery.  We were told that 7 
out of the 10 ARTO mgmt commttee preferred 'pay as bid'.  Anyway we argued 
for 'single market clearing price'.  We also suggested that transmission 
owners should not make a decision that affected market participants.  We 
managed to convince a some stakeholder with our arguments and ARTO held a 
spot vote that recorded 3 for 'pay as bid', 9 for 'single market clearing 
price and 9 'not enough info'....i have heard to ARTO took this into account 
and will leave it to stakeholders which again is a positive step for the 
process. I strongly supported 'single market clearing price' whereas Dynegy 
was a strong proponent for 'pay as bid' but having talked to their people in 
Houston they say that that is not their position (its seems like they have 
the same problem as other large firms....).  So getting time with their 
decision makers would be useful.


I hope this update is useful, give me a call with any queries or feedback.

Subject:	RTO_SS Parallel Test Sessions


The SPP members completed the first of several scheduled parallel test
sessions of the new electronic scheduling system, RTO_SS.  This first
session was held on Friday, April 27 from 9am CDT to 1pm CDT.  There
were a total of 9 SPP Control Areas that participated during this
session.  Those Control Areas included; WR, KCPL, CSWS, WPEK, GRDA, MPS,
SPS, SPA, and CLEC.  Many thanks to all those companies that
participated!  We are hoping for a higher turnout at the next session.
If you do not plan to participate during these parallel test sessions,
please contact Barbara Gibson so arrangements can be made for your
schedule approvals.

These parallel test sessions are excellent opportunities for training
and practice on the new system with live data being imported into
RTO_SS.  During the times that parallel testing is NOT in session, users
can test additional functionality by creating their own sample tags and
taking the various actions on those associated schedules, i.e.
approving, denying, adjusting, canceling, etc.  The system is available
to users 24 hours per day.

There will be 3 more parallel test sessions this week and finally 3
sessions the following week. The sessions this week are scheduled for:

Tuesday, May 1 - 9am CDT - 1pm CDT
Wednesday, May 2 - 9am CDT - 1pm CDT
Friday, May 4 - 12pm CDT - 4pm CDT

Please refer to the attached document for more details regarding logins,
test information, etc.

We still do not have many sources and sinks set up for the different
Generation Providers and Load Serving Entities that wish to have direct
approval rights on the schedules.  If you are a GP or LSE and need to
get this data set up, please call Barbara Gibson or Shari Brown at SPP.

Dear Members-

As you are aware, MAPP has filed with the FERC to change its Line Loading
Relief Procedure to use the NERC Transmission Loading Relief Procedure for
curtailment of Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service and Network and
Native Load obligations.  This is to become effective when automation of the
Network and Native Loads obligation calculation is implemented.  The current
schedule for implementation of this automation is now July 16, 2001.  Please
inform the appropriate individuals in your organization of this schedule.

We will continue to update the Membership as we receive information from
NERC.

Your point is valid; however, you are right that we don't want to emphasize the intra-day hourly part in this pleading since a firm power contract is necessary in order to have firm network service (hourly traders purchasing system contigent or unit contingent during the day would be scheduling the network transmission utilizing ""non-designated resource"", which makes the transmission less firm (right above non-firm PTP)).  ComEd's draft response also discusses this in the context that they are following the tariff.  The point we need to make is that the designation of firm LD contracts absolutely meets FERC's network resource requirements.

We have added an argument that, yet again, even having this type of issue with network, PTP, etc. emphasizes the need to move quickly to the market design that we advocate in the context of an RTO, which would eliminate these parochial issues (and without an icap obligation that Dynegy clearly wants.)

Christi:

I'm good with the filing.  The only point I would make is that our ultimate position is that we don't think we should have to designate any network resource in order to get network firm transmission from the utility.  Our hourly traders don't buy power on firm LD contracts and the utilities in the Midwest have supply imbalance rules that more than adequately incentives us to make sure any power we schedule physically gets to the utility boarder.

I am not sure if this filing is the proper time to bring this up, but I wanted to make the point in case it changes our approach.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: MAPP OASIS Node Maintenance and Upgrade to 2.7.0d: May 16th at 
11:30pm CDT


Dear MAPP Transmission Providers and Customers,

On Wednesday, May 16th at 11:30pm CDT the MAPP OASIS NODE will be taken
off-line for approximately 1 hour for database maintenance.  At the same
time the latest version of OASIS software will be installed , v2.7.0d.

How does this effect MAPP Transmission Providers:

The new version of OASIS software allows for specific redirect service
types.  Two new option fields have been added to the service types, ""Allow
on Redirect"" and ""Account on Reduction"".

These two fields can be changed by selecting ""Transmission Services"" under
Provider Maintenance, and then click on the ID to update the transmission
service.

The ""Allow on Redirect"" option determines whether the service type appears
in the drop down box on the REDIRECT transmission request template.

The ""Account On Reduction"" determines whether REDIRECT request types appear
in the ""Query for Reductions"".

All services types will default to ""No"" for
the two new fields for existing transmission services.

Requirements:
Before the upgrade
1.  All ""Capacity Type"" entries must be unique for each transmission
provider.  Please change your ""Capacity Types"" so that they are unique.

 The ""Capacity Type"" will be changed by the MAPPCOR staff at the time of
upgrade if the unique ""Capacity Type"" for each provider is violated.

After the upgrade
1.  If you do have Redirect transmission service types then select ""Yes"" for
the ""Allow on Redirect"" field.

The MAPP OASIS Test node is available for testing version 2.7.0d.  The test
node can be accessed at:
http://mappb3.oasis.mapp.org/OASIS14/NODE/MAPPB3

How does this effect MAPP Schedule F Customers:

MAPP Schedule F Transmission Customers should select ""HNF Secondary"" as the
Service for redirecting a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm reservation as
Non-Firm.

In addition, to redirect a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm
reservation on Firm basis then one of the following services should be
selected ""FCTS Daily"", ""FCTS Weekly"", ""FCTS Monthly"", ""FCTS Seasonal"", ""FCTS
Yearly"", and ""FCTS Monthly 1 Month"" depending on the remaining duration.

Please try to have your business needs concluded prior to this outage.  We
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Please contact the MAPP Transaction Coordinator if you have further
questions at 651.632.8508 or at transcoords@mapp.org.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

MAPP Transaction Coordinator

Doug...thanks for the hospitality last Tuesday night at Pheasant Run...I
enjoyed hanging out with you and Mike.

On our conversation about trading around MAPP...our assets in the Chicago
area are in an excellent position to be accessible to MidAmerican and
Alliant, and if you'd like to have your spot traders start calling us on
our real-time desk at 800.848.3975 we'd welcome the calls.  Although I
think you may find some reluctance on your side to get done with us,
clearly we can supply odd lots and load-following schedules into MAPP...and
hopefully that gets us some leverage.  If you're willing to undertake
payables to us we're more than happy to accept them.

Well....surprise....surprise.....surprise.  Once again I haven't heard from
many people as to whether they are coming to the picnic or not, and the
ones I have heard from (for the most part) haven't made their hotel
reservations yet.  If you are coming, please give the hotel a call (309)
685-2556 and make sure you tell them you're with the ""Electric Group""
otherwise they will scatter us around the hotel.  Granted, the hotel isn't
that large but having us all in the same general area will mitigate
complaints of noise.....
You only have until Aug. 23rd to get the special rate.

Even if you are not planning on attending but someone from your shop is,
please have them drop me an email to let me know.

I realize everyone has been pretty busy with the hot weather that decided
to settle in for a while, but it's getting ready to break and you will soon
have time to GET THIS DONE!

Once again, PLEASE let me know if you're showing up.....either that, or
don't expect to eat if you do show up.

Thanks

Repayment Procedure

Notice of new MAPP Loss Repayment Policies and Procedures

At the direction of the Regional Transmission Committee of MAPP, new Loss
Repayment Policies and Procedures will be implemented on December 18, 2000.
These changes make the transmission customer, as identified on the OASIS
reservation, responsible for paying energy losses on MAPP Schedule F
transmission service.  Previously, the MAPP Source entity has been
responsible for paying these losses.  These changes do not modify the
application of MAPP's Loss Repayment Procedure (LRP) to MAPP Member Open
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) customers.  Changes to the administration
of Schedule F loss repayment include:
o The Schedule F transmission customer will now be responsible for the LRP
losses on their energy schedules.
o Payment of third party impacts due to ""through flowing"" Schedule F
transactions (where the Source and Sink are both outside MAPP) will be
included in the LRP.
o To facilitate the payment of third party losses, the Customer will make
arrangements with the Source Scheduling Participant (SSP), as defined on the
transmission reservation, to pay for energy transaction losses at the onset
of a schedule.
o The SSP will bank the losses for repayment of third party losses, one week
later, to the day. The repayment is done, as it is today, according to a
schedule sent out by the MAPP Center.

MAPP's Schedule F OASIS:

Subject: RE: MAPP Transmission Customers,


John,

Sorry for the delay in responding to your Email,  but I'll do my best to 
answer your questions.  Please keep in mind that my knowlege of MAPP's 
transmission charges are limited to what I have been told or read and if 
someone at MAPP has any additional information that would be helpful, they 
should respond or perhaps you could address your questions to them.

It appears that you may be confusing MAPP's ""scheduling"" fee with the S/D fee 
for the CA's - it is confusing that they call their's a scheduling fee also 
and there's two of them.  The CA's didn't charge their S/D fee in the past as 
that was the practice, but also MAPP was in the past telling CA's that they 
should/could NOT charge their S/D fee also.  I believe that it was for 
simplicity, based on the assumption that if no one charged that would be the 
same if all charged, as we were all members.    Clearly the language in Sched 
F now indicates that the transmission customer will pay MAPP's ""Scheduling 
and Tariff Administration"" fee and also the CA's S/D fee.

The following is an excerpt from MAPP tariff found on their Home page:

Ancillary Services are needed with transmission service to maintain 
reliability within and among the Control Areas affected by the transmission 
service.  The Contractor shall provide, and the Transmission Customer is 
required to purchase under this Tariff, (i) Scheduling and Tariff 
Administration and (ii) Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation 
Sources.  In addition, the Transmission Customer shall schedule transmission 
service directly with the applicable Transmission Provider, and shall be 
subject to the Transmission Provider's charges for scheduling service, for 
each Transmission Provider system in which (i) the Transmission Customer's 
resource is located, (ii) the Transmission Customer's load is located, (iii) 
power is scheduled into the MAPP Region, and (iv) power is scheduled to leave 
the MAPP Region, provided that the Transmission Customer shall not be subject 
to more than one scheduling charge for a single system.
A Transmission Provider that is the local Control Area operator shall offer 
to provide through its individual open-access transmission tariff (either 
itself or through arrangements with other parties) the following Ancillary 
Services to a Transmission Customer serving load within the Transmission 
Provider's Control Area (i) Regulation and Frequency Response, (ii) Energy 
Imbalance, (iii) Operating Reserve - Spinning, and (iv) Operating Reserve - 
Supplemental.  The Transmission Customer serving load within the Transmission 
System is required to acquire these Ancillary Services from the local Control 
Area operator, from a third party, or by self-supply.
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 list the Ancillary Services offered under this Tariff.
3.1 Scheduling and Tariff Administration Service:  The rates and/or 
methodology are described in Schedule 1.
3.2 Reactive Supply and Voltage Control from Generation Sources Service:  The 
rates and/or methodology are described in Schedule 2.

In regards to the examples that you have listed, it would be my opinion that 
the act of reserving transmision does not result in a Scheduling and Dispatch 
fee, it is the actual Scheduling of the energy which would incur the charge.  
Transmission reserved but not scheduled on would not incur a charge.  If you 
were to schedule energy on the examples you have given, then a S/D fee would 
be charged against each of your examples..

If I can be of any more help, please let me know.

Thanks

Terry>> <John_Olsen@wr.com> 11/01/00 04:05PM >>>

Terry,

Excuse me for my ignorance but it is my understanding that the original
MAPP F rate included scheduling fees when transacting between MAPP members.
With MAPP F being extended to the border company's interconnects, again it
was my understanding that the border company would charge their scheduling
fee for any schedule that left/entered their control area as part of a MAPP
F request.

So that I am clear on what you are planning to do, could you please tell me
what charges WAPA would assess for the following examples.

1.  WR reserves transmission from OAHE to ShercoGen using MAPP F.
2.  WR reserves transmission from OAHE to KCPL.WR using MAPP F.
3.  WR reserves transmission from MILESCITY TO KCPL.WR using MAPP F.

Thank you in advance for clearing this issue up for me.

Bruce,

I'll try to answer your question and clarify our current policy.  As you
will recall, WAPA originally administered it's own tariff and transmission
was purchased directly from WAPA for all of our constrained paths.  There
wasn't a separate Scheduling and Dispatch fee assessed for transmission
purchased under the WAPA tariff, as this fee was built into the
transmission rate.  We posted ATC's for all of our constrained paths (Miles
City, SPC, SWPA (now AECI)) and MAPP Schedule F was not offered for energy
transfers into or out of the MAPP area.  WAPA did not charge a Scheduling
and Dispatch fee for transmission purchased under MAPP Schedule F, because
it was not a common practice by any of the MAPP members to do so.

 A FERC ruling required MAPP  to offer  MAPP Schedule F to Members and
non-members alike, and to eventually open up the use of MAPP F from border
to border, without the requirement to purchase transmission from the border
company. These were major changes, and they occurred in steps, with MAPP
initially offering service schedule F to everyone, then offering Service
Schedule F rates or the border company tariff across the constrained
interfaces, and finally using service schedule F for all transmission into,
out of, or through MAPP, if less than 2 years in duration. During the
transition, WAPA was still responsible for posting the constrained
interfaces, monitoring the flows and re-posting when required.   We charged
our Scheduling and Dispatch fee for all requests that used service Schedule
F to transition across the constrained interfaces, and continue to do so
today. Now the system has evolved where anyone can purchase MAPP schedule F
and MAPP F can be utilized to transfer e!
nergy into, across and out of the entire MAPP member system.  WAPA no
longer administers the constrained interfaces for short term transactions
and MAPP as the transmission provider is responsible for approving all
transmission requests (less then 2 years).  When that change took place,
MAPP was approached and asked to include the S/D fee as part of the MAPP
Schedule F service Fee but MAPP was unwilling to take on this
responsibility.  WAPA management therefore made the decision to start
separately charging a Scheduling and Dispatch fee for all service Schedule
F utilizing our transmission.  This was initially delayed, until we were
able to develop  the software necessary to implement a billing program
automatically..   If the software and programming had been available
earlier, WAPA would have assessed the fee earlier.  Now the programming is
in place and the decision was made to proceed.
I hope this answers your question.  Yes, we have always charged the S/D fee
for MAPP Schedule F transactions across our constrained interfaces but have
now expanded this fee to include all MAPP Schedule F OASIS requests into,
out of , or through our system whether they cross a constrained interface
or not.  The fee is per OASIS request per day and the fee is assessed to
the purchaser of the transmission.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call or Email.

Thank you

Terry

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599",Non Abusive

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--excelr.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""twea=
ks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

The following  letter was sent today to the Midwest ISO Transmission Owners: 
  
As we  move into the Market Trials period, I would like to reiterate how much the  Midwest ISO appreciates your support of our ongoing activities. 

To facilitate your participation in Market  Trials, we are providing two types of informative, interactive orientation  sessions.  One covers the  Electronic Scheduling Process and the other provides an overall Market  Trials Orientation.  These  sessions are designed to provide an essential overview of the drills, scenarios  and reviews necessary for your people to actively participate in the Market  Trials.

The Electronic Scheduling Process  session is available on three different dates in July and the overall Market  Trials Orientation session is offered on two different dates.  Because of the interactive nature of  these sessions the class size must be limited. Ideally, we would prefer no more  than two participants from each company. Please select the individual(s) from  your company who will attend these sessions, and forward the attached  registration brochure to them.   Please advise me if your needs exceed the requested attendance guideline  of two people per company. We will make every effort to accommodate your  request.

We recognize that asking you to sustain a  steady commitment of time, resources and manpower is an exacting demand.  Your confidence that your Market Trials  participants gain as much knowledge about the Midwest ISO's operational  abilities is equally important to us.

We are grateful for your continued support  of the Midwest ISO and look forward to working with you during the Market Trials  period.

One covers the  Electronic Scheduling Process and the other provides an overall Market  Trials Orientation.  These  sessions are designed to provide an essential overview of the drills, scenarios  and reviews necessary for your people to actively participate in the Market  Trials.
The Electronic Scheduling Process  session is available on three different dates in July and the overall Market  Trials Orientation session is offered on two different dates.  Because of the interactive nature of  these sessions the class size must be limited. Ideally, we would prefer no more  than two participants from each company. Please select the individual(s) from  your company who will attend these sessions, and forward the attached  registration brochure to them.   Please advise me if your needs exceed the requested attendance guideline  of two people per company. We will make every effort to accommodate your  request.
We recognize that asking you to sustain a  steady commitment of time, resources and manpower is an exacting demand.  Your confidence that your Market Trials  participants gain as much knowledge about the Midwest ISO's operational  abilities is equally important to us.
We are grateful for your continued support  of the Midwest ISO and look forward to working with you during the Market Trials  period.

23550,baughman-d/power/miso/17.,<8306421.1075855143168.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I talked to Terry Bilke at the MISO today about the training sessions and they have room in the classes on the 30th and 31st. He informed me that they would have more classes coming in the future. They have requested each company to limit the number of people they send to two for each session. I would like to suggest we send two people this time and in future sessions (fall) we could send another group. That is if anyone can spare people this time of the year.
I ask Terry when the MISO will be operational and his reply was FERC order 2000 stated that RTO'S will be running by Dec.15, 2001 and that date is their target. One of the MISO's biggest problems seems to be staffing. In an agreement with the MAIN  region they must leave 30% of the jobs open to MAIN employees but no one wants to move. The two parties have been negotiating that agreement but I don't know if anything has come out of the talks.  
Thanks,
Keith

Subject:=09Meeting on Tuesday, 710/01 @ 1PM

Per our discussion this morning I've put the above date and time on my cale=
ndar to discuss the following groups as it relates to your business goals a=
nd needs.

State of Tennessee, has given an OK to excelr for upgrading FASER to E2is st=
atewide.  I wrote the product description for them for FASER which allowed =
the to do a software upgrade and not have to do a statewide RFP.  During th=
e meetings with them they indicated they are being courted by TVA to have a=
 statewide electric agreement with the State receiving one bill and TVA re-=
billing all of the Muni's and UDC's for their distribution charges.  The st=
ate's energy consumption is $90M/year.  The Energy Manager for the State is=
 on the Governor's Commisssion which just completed a statewide energy poli=
cy.  It will be announced in the near future.  During our meeting with them=
 he indicated that the Govenor who is Republican indicated that excelr had c=
reated President Bush's Energy Policy.  Since this could turn into a much n=
eeded positive political win for excelr, I had Pam Rosen, my marketing manag=
er advise Mark Palmer and  Rick Shapiro about the process.  Pam, also has c=
ontacted Barbara Hueter, from Governmental Affairs for Tennessee regarding =
the progress of this as well. =20

Metal Treating Institute, MTI is an Association has had a relationship with=
 excelr for the past couple of years.  Due to the different marketing strate=
gies of EES over the past couple of years they haven't been handled very we=
ll for gas.   Their CEO who has known me over the years asked me to speak a=
t their National Conference on 7/28 on energy,etc a few months back.  The i=
ntent was to get some type of energy program going for their members and I =
was also going to focus on how important it was to have software at all the=
 companies to assist them in having control of their data.  During a call t=
oday from Lance Miller, MTI's CEO he wanted to confirm the speaking arrange=
ment, topic, etc.  He also advised me their incoming International Presiden=
t is the largest metal treating in Canada and he asked him to contact his p=
erson at excelr Canada to call myself, and you about seeing if they could re=
ceive the same type of service here in the states.  (Sorry, for doing this =
but, with the latest re-org at EEIS, I needed to give him a name other than=
 myself to keep the relationship going)   The one unique thing about this g=
roup is that they would be willing to as an association do a master swap ag=
reement with a supplier and have their members ratify the deal.  Since Lanc=
e is attorney it was much easier for me to have him sell the Board of Direc=
tors on this concept.  excelr still has an opportunity to be the supplier fo=
r them however quite honestly, with all of the lack of interest by us over =
this past year their patience is running out and other companies are really=
 focusing on them as well.
 =20
City of Phoenix is a current E2is customer of EEIS and is looking to buy th=
eir power from someone, they are being courted by APS and SRP.

State of Michigan, is a new E2is customer as of this month and when I spoke=
 at their Big 10 Energy Conference two months ago they indicated their elec=
tric agreement and gas agreement are coming due.  They're currently $5 mill=
ion over budget because the didn't hedge their gas contract.  They also hav=
e issues with their gas fired co-gen which causes huge spikes in power and =
gas usage.  Using interval data, having all of their meter information and =
billing centralized on one system will be a tremendous assist to them.  The=
 other Big 11 as they call themselves all have similar situations.  Michiga=
n, wants to be the spokes person on this product as it evolves and the othe=
r schools are waiting for their input.

As you indicated, the timetable listed above could change depending on sche=
dules.  I will plan on it being so unless you notify otherwise.  Also, coul=
d you let me know where we will be meeting.

Thanks,

Dave

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists w=
ere:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mi=
ssion; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California=
 - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBr=
idge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in =
the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable. =20

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates)=
 should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on wh=
ich instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs=
 are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

Let me know if you have any questions.

On the regulatory front, Cinergy will be joining the Midwest ISO and I have been working with Mike Roan on these issues.  Kerry Stroup has also been brought in recently to focus on Day One issues while Mike is going to focus on Day Two issues.  I would recomend we pull Mike in on this meeting since Kerry is in our Dublin office and is just getting up to speed on MISO activities.  

Also, I have had a number of conversations with the CG&E transmission group and can give everyone an overview of their operational procedures.

Jeff,

I spoke with Tom May on how to attack this project.  We discussed setting up a meeting with you guys, myself, Kayne Coulter, Gerald Gilbert, Don Baughman and the regulatory personnel from the regions involved--much like we did in the ERCOT meeting.  I've copied Susan Lindberg and will speak with her on who and when we can meet to discuss the issues we face with tariffs, RTOs, procedures, scheduling, etc.

I will let you know when we can round up everyone so we can get this kicked off ASAP.  I'll speak with Susan this afternoon & find out who we can lean on from a regulatory perspective. 

I'll call you Thursday morning to let you know what I've found out.  My apologies for the delay.

Jeff,

Thanks for your time this morning, here is the schedule and approximate loads that we discussed this morning.  The existing load figures are based on all customers, actual economics based on utility standard offers will dictate what percentage is economically viable to take physical.  The initial need for CG&E will be getting the transmission agreements in place to be able to designate a TSA (transmission scheduling agent).  Let me know if you have any other questions.

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's ""RTO Week"" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was ""RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets.""  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

23563,baughman-d/power/miso/4.,<6847856.1075855142594.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Good news.  It sounds like MISO will offer a way to handle losses financially.  Based on their previously filed tariff, it appeared that they would not, but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new Attachment M that details how they will handle losses financially.  I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine.

Now, for the Important Question.  MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15.  I don't think this is an issue for us (I expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules (dropping off losses along the path).

If this is not correct, and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions, please let me know ASAP.  Also let me know how prevalent that practice is.  MISO is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on Dec 15.  While they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline, they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem.

Financial losses are essentially at the option of the TO, so we ""may"" be able to do Financial losses if the TOs want to offer the service.

In more detail, this is how the process will work:

TCs will use the MISO's loss calculator to identify impacted TOs
If ALL TOs have provided financial loss pricing information, then it will be possible to buy losses
If not, the TC will be required to self supply

TOs can change their loss pricing (or desire to offer financial losses) every 12 hours.  Effectively, this means it will be difficult at best to manage risk associated with having the FIN rug pulled out from under us at scheduling time.  I will continue to work on this issue with Mike  and push for a financial solution that provides for our needs.

General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""twea=
ks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

As promised I talked to someone here who is knowledgable about pagers.  The
pager service GMP subscribes to has nationwide service, and GMP only
subscribes to service for the Northeast because that's all we require.  I'm
betting that excelr's paging provider has nationwide service, so the page
sent by Vermont Yankee will reach Houston as long as excelr subscribes to
nationwide service.  The tech here at GMP said that a lot of paging is
Internet based now.  For instance a page sent by Vermont Yankee would be
translated into an email and arrive in Houston as an email and then a
machine in Houston would transmit the email to a tower in Houston which
would send the page.  I was told by someone at Vermont Yankee they use ""Air
Source Pro"" software to send the page and excelr's paging provider must have
software compatible with Air Source Pro in order for excelr to receive the
page.

Could you check with a tech person at excelr to find out whether your paging
provider is compatible with Air Source Pro and whether excelr subscribes to
nationwide service?

   Woody,

   Sorry for the delay in my response.  I was out on Tuesday & Wednesday.
   I am

   forwarding an email from Nancy Brock (below).  Does excelr wish to be
   paged

   (if that's technically feasible), or would email satisfy excelr?

   I spoke with VY yesterday about notifying excelr.  We should work with
   Bobbi

   (Bruce is far less willing to accommodate...).  Bobbi says she will be
   happy

   to add excelr to the pager list as long as excelr has a VY pager that
   works in

   Houston.  In the alternative, she will add excelr to the blast email.
   Since I

   assume that excelr's email would be monitored 24/7 for this sort of
   thing,

   that may be the cheapest and easiest way to go.  She said that emails
   are

   not sent for every downpower (whereas pagers are notified for almost

   everything), depending on severity.  I would say that next step is to

   understand what can be done with an email and does it satisfy the excelr

   needs.  If that doesn't work, we'll have to see about the pager.  I
   think

   Bobbi wants to accommodate us, she just needs to understand what excelr

   needs.",Non Abusive

Below is the information that I need from Arch Wireless to have excelr up and
running on the pager system for Vermont Yankee.

Contact Properties:
Contact Name - I'm assuming that's going to be you.  If you are not going to
be holding the pager at all times then we may want to have a generic contact
name.
Pager ID/Pin:	8774946661 (Please verify if I need to use all 10 digits -
do I need hyphens?)
Carrier Name:
Phone Number:	This needs to be a 800 or 888 number.
Max Characters: ?
Service Type:	Alpha or Numeric
Baud Rate:	?
Settings:	?
We use AirSource Pro Software and the modem settings are as follows:

Gateway Telepath Modem
Commands:	AT&F&K0&N0E0X4

The modem commands are not carrier specific so I need the command string to
be compatible with the following carriers:

Rinkers
CVC Paging
Arch
Contact

The backup system we've put in place has the following modem settings:

Gateway 2000 Telepath II Fax Modem
AT&C1&D2&K0&M0&N1Q0V1

I hope this helps regarding the information.  Hope it's not too
overwhelming.
Please contact me at (802) 258-4120 or via email if you have any questions.
Thanks again for your help.  I'd like to have this up and runner by the end
of next week.

Three interesting things.  
 
1.  The Steer Starletts Fundraiser we think is  going on this Thursday night.  It is a very good Rodeo social  event.  Lots of honies, free drinks and free food.  I will keep you  posted.  I should find out for sure today that it is going on.
 
2.  The Rodeo Kickoff dance is going on next  Wednesday the 16th.  You and Travis are invited to come with me if ya'll  would like.  Or meet me somewhere in the area.  It starts at 7:30 or  something like that.
 
3.  On Friday night some of us are going to  the Firehouse to celebrate Barbara Prukop's 35th birthday.  Ya'll are  invited to that also.
 
So let me know something about joining us for any  of the above social events.

   Clinton's Beloved Dog Buddy Killed by Car
   NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buddy, the chocolate retriever once seen
bounding
   around the White House gardens with Bill Clinton, was killed by a car
   near the former president's home in Chappaqua, N.Y., police said
   Thursday.
   A police officer said the dog was hit Wednesday afternoon but it was
not
   clear whether it was being walked at the time or had wandered off the
   property owned by Clinton and his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
   ``His dog was hit by a car ... we received a call yesterday
afternoon,''
   said Sgt. Charles Ferry of the New Castle, N.Y., police that also
covers
   suburban Chappaqua in Westchester County north of New York City.
   The former president's spokeswoman Julia Payne said the Clintons
``are
   deeply saddened by Buddy's death.'' In a statement issued by Payne,
the
   family said, ``He was a loyal companion and brought us much joy. He
will
   be truly missed.''
   Payne said Buddy was 4-1/2 years old and was taken into the White
House
   as Clinton's pet soon after he was born. Clinton left the White House
in
   January 2001 after serving two four-year terms. Hillary Clinton

Yes, I believe we will.  It is a $1000 penalty -- ridiculous.  We will oppose the concept of a penalty in general, as well as the amount, which seems very arbitrary.  We are also requesting, in a separate proceeding, a moratorium on tariff filings by MISO until the Midwest RTO process has progressed sufficiently to allow meaningful consideration of the tariff.
I am not sure who is doing the writing but we'll run a draft by you.

trucks because they didn't want to offend anyone in the  community.

In an ""act of tolerance"" the head of the public  library at Florida Gulf
Coast University ordered all ""Proud to be an  American"" signs removed so as
to not offend international students.

I, for one, am quite disturbed by these actions of  so-called American
citizens; and I am tired of this nation worrying  about whether or not we
are offending some individual or their culture.  Since the terrorist
attacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge  in patriotism by the
majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely
settled in New York and Washington D.C. when the  ""politically correct""
crowd began complaining about the possibility that  our patriotism was
offending others.

I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is
seeking a  better life by coming to America. In fact, our country's
population is  almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants;
however, there  are a few things that those who have recently come to our
country, and  apparently some native Americans, need to understand.

First of  all, it is not our responsibility to continually try not to
offend you  in any way. This idea of America being a multi-cultural
community has  served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national
identity. As  Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own
language,  and our own lifestyle. This culture, called the ""American Way""
has been  developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by
millions  of men and women who have sought freedom. Our forefathers fought,
bled,  and died at places such as Bunker Hill, Antietam, San Juan, Iwo
Jima,  Normandy, Korea, Vietnam.

We speak English, not Spanish, Arabic,  Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any
other language. Therefore, if you  wish to become part of our society --
learn our language!

""In  God We Trust"" is our national motto. This is not some off-the-wall,
Christian, Right Wing, political slogan -- it is our national motto. It is
engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it is
printed on our currency. We adopted this motto because Christian  men and
women, on Christian principles, founded this nation; and this is  clearly
documented throughout our history. If it is appropriate  for our motto to
be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of  Government, then it is
certainly appropriate to display it on the walls  of our schools.

God is in our pledge, our National Anthem,  nearly every patriotic song,
and in our founding documents. We honor His  birth, death, and resurrection
as holidays, and we turn to Him in prayer  in times of crisis. If God
offends you, then I suggest you consider  another part of the world as your
new home, because God is part of our  culture and we are proud to have Him.

We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our
freedoms. We celebrate Independence Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and
Flag Day. We  have parades, picnics, and barbecues where we proudly wave
our flag.  As an American, I have the right to wave my flag, sing my
national  anthem, quote my national motto, and cite my pledge whenever and
wherever I
choose. If the Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't  like Uncle Sam,
then you should seriously consider a move to another  part of this planet.

The American culture is our way of life,  our heritage, and we are proud of
it. We are happy with our culture and  have no desire to change, and we
really don't care how you did things  where you came from. We are
Americans, like it or not, this is our  country, our land, and our lifestyle.

Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion
about our government, culture, or society, and we will allow you every
opportunity to do so. But once you are done complaining, whining, and
griping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life,
I highly  encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom,
the  right to leave.

The Southwest Power Pool (SPP) was provided notice at 1200 on 11/2/01 that the termination will occur hour ending 24 on November 3, 2001. At that time, KCPL will no longer be a member of MAPP. KCPL will maintain its membership in SPP as a Transmission Owner under the SPP OATT. This requires a modification of how reservations under the SPP OATT should be made and how associated schedules should be submitted. Only reservations with a POR/POD of KCPL are at issue. SPP wants to take this opportunity to inform our customers of the associated changes. Please see the attached document, which has also been posted on the SPP OASIS page, on how reservations will be treated.

Don, it was great talking to you about hunting and shooting today.  Below is the link to Central Flyway Outfitters (CFO).  They are a top notch guide service out of Winnie, Texas (near Beaumont) that specialize in duck and goose hunting.  They have hunting packages around $150 a gun (they offer corporate discounts as well).  All you need is a license, shells, gun, and waders:  they will take care of the transportation (4 wheelers), guide, and dog.  

I am heading down there tomorrow for a hunt with my uncle.  I will let you know how we do.  If you are interested I can arrange hunt on a future Saturday or Sunday morning.  Regards, Lyle

?=09Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Mo=
nday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it=
 is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in o=
n Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who=
 are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names ha=
ve been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday=
.
o=09Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?=09Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the r=
outes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure =
to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you nee=
d additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highligh=
ted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have=
 their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access withou=
t their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via =
the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back throug=
h the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kio=
sk in the excelr building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to=
 ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?=09Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a=
 list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be =
on the floor when we move in. =20
o=09Red - Move Team
o=09Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o=09Green - Telephony

?=09Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subsc=
riptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all =
daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor co=
rridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up =
the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up t=
he papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of EC=
N, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?=09Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more tha=
n about 4  boxes per person. =20

?=09Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any label=
s, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels pr=
inted.

?=09Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been remo=
ved from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are=
 left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to =
move the computers as scheduled.

.=09Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses fi=
ltered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on=
 the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of=
 water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water =
at several locations. =20

?=09Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to =
remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret=
 or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be wa=
iting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might=
 have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much =
for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRID=
AY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with=
 the move.

Thanks for the invite.  I wish I could make it.  You need to plan a trip
down here for a little fin and feather.  Joe got himself a nice custom
flats and we need to break it in right.  A lot of geese and ducks are
being killed on lake Mathis right now and I'm sure we can manage to find
some trout somewhere.

Happy birthday and drink one for me.

I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day.  I tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year, to no avail.  Just wanted to catch up, and go drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger.  

Doing fine down here in Houston.  I bought a house in League City.  In addition, I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the summer.  We are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship.  I am doing well at excelr, managing the real-time power trading desk and trading.  excelr, as you have seen in the paper, is experiencing some trouble.  We are reasonably sure we will merge with Dynegy in mid to late 2002.  Family is doing well; my sister is about to have her second baby.  Travis is back from his year and a half tour in Europe, and took a position with Cemex as an account manager.  Dad is about 3/4 retired and he and mom are doing a fair amount of hunting & fishing.  Travis & I are gonna spend Thanksgiving in West Texas, deer hunting.  

How's life in Hooterville?  I heard that you are full on retired! FANTASTIC!  What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?  Hopefully consuming large quantities of beer & tequila and blowing you eardrums out with Jimmy Buffett!

Tell when you are not busy and I will drive up, or have you down to the house and the bayhouse.  Hope to hear from you soon.

You may be aware that the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission=20

quality standards.  Targeted sources are those that emit 10 tons per year o=

trading programs such as the Title IV SO2 acid rain program, the OTC NOx=20
program, and the RECLAIM program.

At the request of a number of HGA proposed program participants, Cantor=20

 January 29, 2002	 January 30-31, 2002	
This executive forum goes beyond the public policy pronouncements to confront the tough, practical issues of implementation. It will bring together executives from some of the few transmission-owning organizations and their bankers and consultants that have come to grips with these issues over many months prior to the December 15 deadline. They will identify solutions and discuss the best ways to proceed in the near- to mid-term.	In 2002 owners, grid operators, system users, and investors will be forced to make sense of the multitude of changes affecting transmission business. To chart a course toward value creation for transmission assets while steering around the rocky shores of these regulatory changes it will also be important to understand the sometimes conflicting agendas of FERC and state regulators.

Subject:	Florida RTO

Bernie,

Steve,

	In the FPSC's ongoing investigation into whether it is prudent for
Florida IOUs to form a RTO and into the costs associated with a RTO, it
issued an order last week finding that the IOUs' proactive formation of
GridFlorida in response to Order No. 2000 is prudent.  It said, however,
that it did not find certain aspects of the GridFlorida proposal to be in
the best interests of Florida's retail ratepayers.

Of particular concern to the FPSC is the transfer of ownership of
transmission assets that the current GridFlorida proposal contemplates.  The
FPSC said it believes that ""the benefits associated with the transco
structure of GridFlorida can be achieved under an ISO structure, in which
participants would continue to own their transmission assets while the RTO
would have operational control over those assets. ... The record indicates
that the potential for customer benefits is just as likely under an ISO
structure as the transco structure proposed for GridFlorida. ... While we
appreciate the merits of transferring ownership of transmission assets to
GridFlorida, we believe that a more cautious, transitional approach is
prudent for Peninsular Florida at this time.""

The FPSC is satisfied with either a for-profit or not-for-profit ISO.

The FPSC asked that the IOUs modify the GridFlorida proposal consistent with
the terms of the FPSC order and file the modified proposal within 90 days of
the December 20, 2001 order.

Let me know if you need further information.  We can scan the order into an
Acrobat file and e-mail it to you, if you like.

John and Mike, I suggest you do the same for the NE and ERCOT.  I've listed what I believe are Tier 1 trans companies for these regions, but I suggest you review and also update which are Tier 2 and 3.  I plan on having this finalized tomorrow (Tuesday) morning.

Additionally, I suggest an hourly person be the lead commercial person.  Don, please take the lead with Bill Rust in putting an hourly name for the commercial lead on each.

Fletch & Dana - Please take the lead on creating the product offering list (physical and financial).  My recommendation is we put products out through 03 for all regions (financial and physical).   Obviously, the physical products will be contingent on receiving a power marketing license.

We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.excelronline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

Subject: Lunch??


Sally/Mike,

I will be in Houston the week after Christmas (12/26-12/29) and was
wondering if the two of you were going to be in the office, and if so, would
you be available for lunch? In talking with David Beck, he was going to try
to arrange a golf game (Mike, me, Richard Kimberlin and David) one of those
afternoons at Champions. If that is possible, then maybe lunch before golf
might work. If not, then I can meet you downtown when convenient. Let me
know what your schedules are like and I will plan my schedule accordingly.

Also, I need to know if I need to mail the Orange Bowl tickets to both of
you separately or just one of you. Didn't know if you are planning on going
to Miami together? I should receive the tickets in the next day or two and
will do whatever. Ought to be a fun trip, as it has definitely been awhile
since the Sooners have been to Miami.

Anyway, let me know if you are available for lunch/gold or just lunch.

Hope you all have a wonderful holiday season and most of all get to spend
time with your families!

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

Sally,
Cindy Olson said you'd be a good person to talk with on this subject, as 
someone who has considerable experience with this concept.
I'm doing some research on the ASE and whether to create something internally 
for excelr use. The key questions are: which would be the aspects we'd keep 
and which would be the aspects we'd discard.?
Can I get 15-30 minutes of your time to discuss in the next week or two?

Patti,
If Sally gives the OK, can you call Stacey on 30945 and set up a time please?

 to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for 
London counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are 
doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) 

 discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your

continually improve the process), 

 discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office

 do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE

 discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London 

 discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around

Sally - A new idea popped into my head - I don't know if it makes things
easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes:

What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy
- in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the
YO Ranch or somewhere.   We might spend one night or two - plan something
fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad
with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go
somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.

Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more
special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San
Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.

This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but
provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom
and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.    Maybe we could ""chip in""
varying amounts to Mom and Dad's trip so that cindy and richard could afford
it.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Subject: Lagrasta Origination

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

The phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students' numbers at school.

All,

Please find attached what is now the latest and (subject to minor 
adjustments), the final version of the future excelr Metals North America 
organizational structure.

Effective November 1, the Montreal, Chicago and St Louis office's have been 
reconfigured into Agency offices.  I would like to thank all of you for your 
support and cooperation during this integration phase.  Clearly more work 
needs to be done but the major risk and control issues have been addressed.

 
Best regards,
Marcelo

Sally,

I'd like to get on your calendar for a brief meeting to discuss the 
organization change resulting from Scott's departure.  I have an idea if you 
have not finalized the new structure.  

I understand that Shona has some international experience and thought we 
could leverage that to our benefit.

One other item that needs to be addressed is our current location on 21.  I 
understand it is highly coveted by Tom Gros for expansion of the Commodity 
Logic team.  
Thank you.

Martha

Barnes & Noble -- 100 Best Family Resorts in North America.  I found the name 
of one place that I have seen in the past in magazines that I always thought 
looked good - High Hampton Inn and Country Club in North Carolina.  Another 
place that I have seen is something like Blackberry Farm in Tennessee.  Both 
meet the criteria of mountains in the Carolina/Tennessee range.  I will get 
info on both and we can look at it.  I worry a little bit about having such a 
range of ages that I want to make sure that we go someplace where there is 
plenty to do for all -- just sitting for some, shopping, eating, golf, etc.  
These two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough 
variety.  I thought that I would also get some info on some other places that 
may not have popped up on Mom and Dad's list but that might be good for the 
whole family.  One of those might catch their interest as well. 

I can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to Mom and Dad that the 
thought of this trip could wear thin.  I would like the opportunity to be 
together with everyone -- maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the 
two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night!  Even though Dad is 
doing so much better, you never know when you will have the chance to get 
everyone together on a trip like this.  Memory-maker or nightmare -- could be 
a toss up, but maybe worth the try.  Let's share some research and see if 
there is any place that we could get excited about going.

Hi, Sally,

Am sure you are swamped having been gone for a while...was glad to see OU
won the game--figured that made it a better trip for you!

Now that we know Dad will be around, shall we rev up the anniversary
planning again--or should we blow it off and do some great present--maybe
just send them somewhere?  Maybe it is just the increased holiday time with
them but Mom and Dad are kind of getting on my nerves right now....am sure
it will pass....

AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who 
led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover 
gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study 
itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.  
Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the 
questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very 
useful.  

I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for 
passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the 
person that has contacted you.  Just let me know his/her name and number and 
I will follow through on that if you would like.  

Hope that your holidays was enjoyable and that the new year will be a good 
one for you.  --Sally

Sally,

I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request.
They renewed their request for excelr's participation.

What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing what's
going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the 
project.

My recommendation is to forget it.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Peter Nance and I wanted to follow-up our discussion of excelr's participation 
in our benchmarking study.  Have you discussed excelr's participation in the 
project with your colleagues?

Here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive 
list of over 700 metrics.  The study group will decide which metrics to use.

With EEI's credibility and Teknecon's technical expertise, we intend to 
become the industry standard in benchmarking.  We would very much like to 
have excelr participate in the study.

I would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with 
Peter Nance if you think that would be helpful.

Best regards,

responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the

call me and tell me that he still doesn't know when this task will be 
completed.  That was his concern yesterday, and Kim's note really doesn't 
address that.  If she doesn't have an estimated completion date, then she 
should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that 
at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing 
the task.  

Kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions, or I will be the one 
that gets the phone calls.  The ENA organization must develop confidence in 
others on our team.  Let's help Kim earn that confidence by coaching her to 
imagine the info that the customers needs (Stephen) and to clearly

Kim, do you have an estimated completion date for the commodities where the

one commodity that is up-to-date (financial power) is the one with the lowest 
number of transactions.  That means that the lion's share of the work is 
still to be done.  Are we staffed to get this completed in a timely manner?

promptly.  Let me know if you need his help, and I will visit with Brent 
Price.  I know that Brent would support Jeff's involvement to get this caught 
up.

From this point forward, the RMT Confirmation will be prepared on a monthly

to review the SAP implementation work - both should be in place .

Subject: Holiday Wrap Up and January Plans

Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for 
shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but 
certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, 
volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very 
good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is 
nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those 
Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  

I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of 
January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through 
Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and 
Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How 
does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and 
what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time 
during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you 
don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up 
discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that 
it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the 
office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus 
information.)  

I am in the office all of this week.  --Sally

In response to the below, there was a short planning meeting between 
Commercial Support and IT, specific objectives were identified which would 
enhance the DPR and reporting process, and improve the robustness of our 
processes, the following has been agreed in principle:

1. Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, 
pending agreement from the Office of the Chair.
2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be 
signed off by risk management before end of day.
3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a 
comparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's 
portfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to 
be reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )
4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be 
reported to technical support in the event of a failure.  

The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time 
for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning 
of the next trading day.

Early in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each 
business area/valuation system for the following:
a) current state
b) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking
c) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - 
Market Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - 
implementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )

Upon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full 
commercial signoff

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

Subject: NOV. 4TH SUPER SATURDAY INTERVIEWS

I am a recruiting co-ordinator with the Associate and Analyst Programs.  We 
are looking for additional offices within which to conduct interviews this 
Saturday, November 4th.  We are bringing in over 80 candidates and are in 
need of interview rooms.  Many of excelr's Executives and VPs recognize the 
importance of the success of this event and have lent their offices to us for 
these interviews.  However, many more offices are needed.  The interview 
process begins at approximately 9:00 a.m. and will conclude by 1:00 p.m. that 
Saturday.  If you are concerned about the sensitive nature of some of the 
materials in your office, we ask that you simply move the confidential 
documents to one side of your desk and/or credenza.  We will see that the 
materials are turned ""face down"" or covered with a blank piece of paper so as 
not to disturb their original state.  Unlike previous years, the excelr 
interviewers will be in the designated offices at all times with the 
candidates.   All offices will be locked after the completed interview 
process.  Please let me know the availability of your office for interviews 
at your earliest convenience.    We encourage your participation and 
appreciate your support.

shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but 
certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, 
volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very 
good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is 
nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those 
Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  

I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of 
January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through 
Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and 
Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How 
does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and 
what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time 
during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you 
don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up 
discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that 
it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the

information.)

a same day calculation of their books.  Mike and I have talked about this as 
a longer term goal for the London office and I knew that he was working with 
James and others to come up with a plan and a timeline.  I expect to review 
that with Mike when he has it in a draft form that warrants that discussion.  
That is why you haven't yet seen the document.  --Sally

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

of this process, we will be sending ALL MANUAL WIRES for GBP and EUR and all 
intercompany payments for the first week of January.  Corporate Treasury does

Americas staff member on Shawn's team has not been involved to date with 
Doorstep reviews or planning.  Although Shawn made an offer to Michelle some 
time ago, there was a long lead time for her arrival.  She did not start with 
the company until after Thanksgiving.  Since she started a couple of weeks 
ago, Wes and I have asked her to look into several specific findings from the 
most AA internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some 
solutions to issues that were raised.  There simply has not been the time to 
date to expose her to Doorstep.  

After Shawn and I meet (see below), I will briefly summarize for you the 
roles that all groups will play in the Doorstep Review process.  Before we 
move forward I want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose, 
methodology, participants and execution plan for this on-going project.

Hi there  -- As I recall you are off next week, so wanted to touch base.  I 
am sure you will be ready  -- after PRC's and the craziness that has been 
going on over there.  

Just wanted to confirm my availability   and maybe see if we should get 
together while I am in Houston  (will be there between Christmas and New 
Year's) and could come in for a few hours or meet you for lunch.  

I think you said that you will be in London in early January - is that still 
happening?  Alternatively we could get together then.

Also -- I am planning to be ready to start work with you on Jan 29th  
(hopefully I can get Lauren into her school the week before - so she can get 
used to it).   We are leaving London on the 20th (AA signs of on our year end 
earnings release on Friday the 19th)  and then I will have a week to sort 
things out at home before starting!



I am really looking forward to learning something new, and working with you.  
Thanks for the opportunity.



If we don't speak before the holidays, I hope your family has a wonderful 
Christmas.

The party was an absolute success, but one of the main reasons why was

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE

Hey--how was your weekend--fudge delivered?

Got my bake sale item done--an 18 layer cookie tower.  Have 9 houses baked
with 3 to go.

Now to show that I really have gone nuts--I thought I would cook breakfast
for the 2nd grade at school on Friday morning....can I have your breakfast
pizza recipe?  We all thought it was great and I think the kids will think
it is fun....

Thanks!

the right time, you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest 
(global products).  They can give you the best estimate on timing.  I am 
copying them on this memo. 

When your schedule is set, I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with 
a copy of the schedule (dates, names and contact numbers).  Please send me a

Sally,

I am currently working on a plan for floor support to provide a better time 
coverage. I would like to hear your suggestion. I have been thinking of 
providing floor support till 8:00 p.m. every weekday for the next 4 weeks. Do 
you want us to extend the hours to later than 8:00 p.m. and longer than 4 
weeks?

I appreciate very much your comments.

Would you ever be interested in helping us with recruiting at OU?  As you are 
probably aware, the analyst programs have been combined into one program, so 
we are searching for top candidates to bring in for all rotations within the 
analyst program.  Upcoming interviews are for summer interns.  We will be on 
campus on Monday, October 30 (just after the OU - Nebraska game).  Let me 
know if you are interested or if you have any questions, and we can get you 
formally added to the team that is recruiting at OU. 

Hope that all is going well in Chicago.  --Sally

Subject: OU Update

Dear OU Team:

I wanted to send a quick update regarding the rest of the fall recruiting 
season:

According to your recruiting guide, we are scheduled to host a Corporate View 
on October 19 and 20.  This has been changed to November 10.  This event will 
now be co-sponsored (in Houston) with Arthur Andersen and will also involve 
students from the Fellows group at Texas A&M.  We were given this opportunity 
through Tim Rasnic (our JC Penney Leadership contact at OU) and Dr. Tim 
Peterson (the contact for our Texas A&M recruiter).  Details will be sent to 
the group as Tim Rasnic finalizes the logistical details between the 2 groups.

Also, we will be conducting Intern Interviews October 30 and 31.  I realize 
this falls at a time when many of you are interested in being with your 
families (as would I), so please keep in mind that the greater number of 
interviewers we have for this event, the sooner we can all get back home to 
TRICK-OR-TREAT!!!  We will sort through the candidate resumes once I receive 
them from Career Services.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be able to help with 
interviews on day 1 (October 30).    
Just to update you on last week's interviews:
We will be inviting 9 candidates to Super Saturday on November 4.  I will 
send their names and contact information to you after each has been notified.

Thanks to each of you for making this season such a success!
I appreciate the time and help you have all provided!

thanks!

Quick question - your confirms - are they signed by both Commercial & Comm 
Supp (as Attorney at Fact) - or by just one or the other?

I want to make sure EBS is consistent.

Currently - one of either Jim F or Paul R are signing all of them - rightly 
so at the moement - not many deals and they want to see all.

Thoughts?

Subject: Agenda and Speaking Points for October 24 Engagement

Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller 
Forum that I am hosting next week.  There will be approximately 30 excelr 
business controllers present at the meeting.  All have responsibility for mid 
and back office operations for the following excelr entities:  excelr North 
America, excelr Europe, excelr South America, excelr Global Markets, excelr 
Industrial Markets, excelr Broadband Services and excelr Energy Services.  
Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New 
York (metals business).   

Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes 
before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to 
be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.  


You are scheduled to address the group as follows:

Date:  Tuesday, October 24, 2000
Time:  8:30 am
  (breakfast will be served at 8:00 and you are invited to join us)
Place:  The Warwick Hotel
  The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 
  5701 Main Street
  Houston,  TX  77005

The group would like to hear about excelr's performance, your outlook for the 
remainder of 2000 and into 2001, your viewpoint on the future of the company 
and next growth opportunities, etc.  With a small group, your talk can be 
informal and you do not need to prepare slides (unless you would like to do 
so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key speaking points that would enforce 
the value of this conference for this group would be:

recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 
2000

your support for global standards for operational controls for trading 
activities
your recognition of the value of operational professionals in the 
organization to ensure integrity of mid and back office functions

Subject: Catalytica Write-down

 On the 12/11 MPR to be issued on 12/12, we will be taking a $56 million loss 
on Catalytica Energy Systems.  This asset will begin trading on the open 
market either Friday, 12/15 or Monday, 12/18 under the ticker CESIV.  The 
potential trading range of $10 - $20 per share is disclosed in the company's 
S-1.  This asset is in Raptor I and therefore this write-down will exhaust 
$56 M of the remaining Raptor I capacity.

 Please call me at x3-6983 with questions.

Subject: Draft Agenda


Attached is a draft agenda for your review and comments.  As speakers were 
confirmed, the placement of certain items on the agenda were dictated by the 
speakers' schedules and then logical grouping of topics around those 
speakers.  Sunday evening will not be heavy - simple welcome and intros, 
drink and dinner - I know that many will be tired from traveling.  We have 
arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy 
chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a 
means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday.  This 
can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.  

The morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement 
of our efforts (Causey).  Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short 
""state of the union of operations"" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and 
EEL).  Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, 
discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.  

Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in 
which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of 
operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could 
have such an impact.  Each table can report back as we gather to start the 
afternoon.  

Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move 
Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and 
lessons learned.  Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going 
project.  

Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool 
for the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.  

We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its 
impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted 
Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.  

Monday evening will include a tour of excelr Field and dinner at Ruggles 
Center Field Terrace.  Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are 
waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.  

Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.  
He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.  He will make an informal 
presentation and then will entertain questions.  The rest of the morning will 
be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action 
steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information 
provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office 
services within excelr.  

Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.  
Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.  
After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to 
reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against 
our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).  

Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.  The only details still 
in flux are Tom Gros' availability and confirmation of Philippe's 
attendance.

confirmed, the placement of certain items on the agenda were dictated by the 
speakers' schedules and then logical grouping of topics around those 
speakers.  Sunday evening will not be heavy - simple welcome and intros, 
drink and dinner - I know that many will be tired from traveling.  We have 
arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy 
chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a 
means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday.  This 
can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.  

The morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement 
of our efforts (Causey).  Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short 
""state of the union of operations"" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and 
EEL).  Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, 
discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.  

Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in 
which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of 
operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could 
have such an impact.  Each table can report back as we gather to start the 
afternoon.  

Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move 
Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and 
lessons learned.  Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going 
project.  

Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool 
for the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.  

We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its 
impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted 
Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.  

Monday evening will include a tour of excelr Field and dinner at Ruggles 
Center Field Terrace.  Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are 
waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.  

Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.  
He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.  He will make an informal 
presentation and then will entertain questions.  The rest of the morning will 
be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action 
steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information 
provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office 
services within excelr.  

Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.  
Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.  
After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to 
reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against 
our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).  

Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.  The only details still 
in flux are Tom Gros' availability and confirmation of Philippe's 
attendance.

Shona,
When we returned from Argentina we concluded that a proper risk management 
system needed to be implemented in order to posture the office for success. 
They have been trading there for over 2 years which is plenty of time to do 
so.  We used Enpower as a phrase meaning ""Proper Risk System"".  If there are 
real questions about the functionality of such, then that obviously begs the 
question as to why we allow someone to transact on behalf of excelr 7500 miles 
away that doesn't understand.  That being said Mike Guerrero seems perfectly 
hip to having the best platform available.  It was excelr NetWorks that said 
that they could implement a ""controlled spreadsheet environment"" that would 
have ALL the functionality of a proper risk system, including risk 
aggregation into RisktRAC, credit aggregation and tracking, option valuation, 
scalability, security and stability. I will not opine on such matters.  They 
must produce or stop transacting.

I believe they have implemented a secure spreadsheet environment in which to 
work.  I know I discussed this during a meeting with Ted and Donna a few 
months ago and we decided we could live with the change to a secure 
environment in lieu of a full EnPower implementation.  Although EnPower would 
be great to have, if commercial decides that the office does not have the 
transaction volume there is not much we can do.  

As I understand it, there are further issues with capturing the appropriate 
curve shift info from these offices in RiskTrac.  Let's discuss what we can 
do and what decisions need to be made.

Thanks

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.

Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel 
knowledge to come up with a different solution.  Everyone will have to 
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Steve

to the November 4th Super Saturday.

Those candidates are:
1. Jonathan Beck (405/579-8594)
2. Jeremy Fitzpatrick (405/447-6144)
3. Thomas Lowell (405/573-1103)
4. Jenia Nikolova (405/325-9435)

8. Thomas Underwood (405/292-1108)
9. Ryan White (405/292-1470)

I personally called each candidate today to invite them to Super Saturday.  
Their formal letters will be sent later in the week.

Our next step will be to cultivate these candidates.  I will be assigning a 
candidate to selected team members next week for cultivation calls.  In the 
mean time, please feel free to call and congratulate them (just please let me 
know who you call so no one is left out!)

Thanks again for your dedication!

Subject: UT Super Saturday Candidates

Dear UT Team:

Thank you for all your time and help over the past several weeks.  Through 
the interview process, we have chosen 38 Financial Analyst candidates to 
bring to Super Saturday on November 4.  These candidates are:

Amanda Ostrander, Ali Ahmed, Bonnie Chang, Brad Morgan, Brad Staller, Brian 
Falik, Brian Kanatzar, Bryan Willingham, Carol Stauch, Castlen Moore, Doug 
Epperson, Chris Calato, Daniel Bates, Daniel Jenkins, David Eastlake, David 
Michels, Hina Khan, Irfan Iqbal, James Lee, Jason Huang, Jay Raman, Judy 
Maledon, Max Sell, Michael Morris, Natalie Madi, Natascha Seume, Paul Horng, 
Ryan Ruebsahm, Ryan Williams, Sean Steele, Shaleen Miller, Stephen Dexter,
Tayyab Balagamwala, Ty Purdy, Lydia Kuo, Matt Linford, Lauren Szeto, and 
Melanie Sandoval.

I have personally called each of the 38 candidates to let them know they have 
been selected.  They will also receive a formal letter through the mail later 
this week.  This letter will include details regarding November 4.

The interviews for the Tax Analyst position also yielded the following:
5 Spring Internship offers:  Ashley Berger, Yi (Zoe) Zhou, Li Li, Weijing 
Shin, and Xuemei Lang
1 Summer Internship offer: Chia-Lin Lee
2 Full Time Office Visits: Andrew Susman and Amanda Ostrander

The next step is cultivation.  I will assign candidates to targeted team 
members for telephone follow-up calls.  I would also like to have volunteers 
to go to Austin next week to take these candidates to dinner.  Please let me 
know if and when you will be available so that I can begin planning.

Thanks again for all your help and hard work!!!

Subject: OU Update

Dear OU Team:

I wanted to send a quick update regarding the rest of the fall recruiting 
season:

According to your recruiting guide, we are scheduled to host a Corporate View 
on October 19 and 20.  This has been changed to November 10.  This event will 
now be co-sponsored (in Houston) with Arthur Andersen and will also involve 
students from the Fellows group at Texas A&M.  We were given this opportunity 
through Tim Rasnic (our JC Penney Leadership contact at OU) and Dr. Tim 
Peterson (the contact for our Texas A&M recruiter).  Details will be sent to 
the group as Tim Rasnic finalizes the logistical details between the 2 groups.

Also, we will be conducting Intern Interviews October 30 and 31.  I realize 
this falls at a time when many of you are interested in being with your 
families (as would I), so please keep in mind that the greater number of 
interviewers we have for this event, the sooner we can all get back home to 
TRICK-OR-TREAT!!!  We will sort through the candidate resumes once I receive 
them from Career Services.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be able to help with 
interviews on day 1 (October 30).    
Just to update you on last week's interviews:
We will be inviting 9 candidates to Super Saturday on November 4.  I will 
send their names and contact information to you after each has been notified.

Thanks to each of you for making this season such a success!
I appreciate the time and help you have all provided!

thanks!

Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power 
volatilities and correlations

As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power 
traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option 
portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that 
the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in 
their mark.

In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light. 
Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as 
this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a 
matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you 
may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the 
deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. 

The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue 
for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at 
the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot 
use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise 
options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any 
way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the 
few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' 
piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of 
worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the 
correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) 
the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  
underlying. 

They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel 
who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most 
experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). 
This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of 
excelr's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the 
volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that 
different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value 
the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns 
over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it 
does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc 
calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike 
price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the 
forward price of the underlying itself. 

We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in 
Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start 
to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.

Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or 
gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no 
there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure 
given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what 
the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have 
Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega 
or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to 
work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like 
to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem 
(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the 
implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current 
system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we 
validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?

Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher 
volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their 
VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily 
remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol 
curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any 
testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). 
The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the 
impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.

I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing 
the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been 
covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having 
to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and 
are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies 
of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have 
not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in 
gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that 
it is not for a lack of trying.

Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived 
inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.

James

Subject: Mid Year Review Info Needed

I need a one page summary for all of your employees before I leave for London 
on Monday, July 10th.  I need this summary and all customer feedback 
delivered to Sue as soon as possible for aggregation.

These are the items I need:

Employee Name

Title

Brief Job Description and Day to Day Responsibilities

Areas of Strengths with Specific Examples

Areas of Improvement with Detailed Strategy and Direction for necessary 
improvement

Accomplishments / Process Improvements Employee made, did, or was part of

What this employee Did / Did not do in the first six months that made your 
life Easier / Harder (Met / Exceeded / Did Not Exceed Expectations)

What you need from each employee in order to help you move your group forward


I really think this should be no greater than one page.  While I am familiar 
with most if not all of these employees, I DO NOT know all of the above 
criteria for everyone.  These are the types of issues I anticipate being 
raised at the larger PRC and I need to make sure that I can answer any 
question raised.

I will sit down with each one of you and discuss each employee page 
individually after the PRC.  I would like to use this page as the PRIMARY 
feedback form for us to deliver to each employee.  This should supplement the 
system feedback form that we have used in the past.  At that time, I plan to 
roll out a group strategy and what is going to be expected from you and your 
groups in order for all of us to accomplish the known goals and objectives of 
our business.  I anticipate having these meetings completed by the end of 
July with feedback beginning around August 1st and finished by August 31st.  
This will give us plenty of time to plan around any issues that arise, 
however I would encourage you to get the feedback completed as soon as 
possible.

Last but by no means least, I would like to thank each and everyone of you 
for all of your hardwork and dedication to our business.  We have had many 
achievements and accomplishments and have taken on many new challenges and 
opportunities.  This is a direct compliment to you and I wanted to say THANK 
YOU!

Have a GREAT Holiday Weekend!

Sally,

Following our Doorstep meeting today, I am following up on your request that 
I forward to you the list of Portland transactions for which we still require 
documentation, e.g. invoices, SAP entries, etc.  For the Settlements testing 
only, we reduced the deal population from 23 to ten randomly-selected 
transactions, in order to facilitate the Settlement group's ability to 
complete both its monthly close obligations and our Doorstep request.  The 
deal selection is indicated in yellow, and the missing items, in green.




Also per your request, attached are the five ""non-standard"" deals for which 
we have been unable to obtain any information at all.  Our primary need is 
just to get a basic understanding of these transactions.

Colorado Springs Utilities  10/1/98-9/30/03 Colorado 50-150 MWs
BPA     10/1/01-12/31/05 NW Delivered 105 MWs

I let Nikki know about a rescheduled date from Rick's PRC last week.  I don't

June 27.  Will you still plan to come to Houston next week?  I have scheduled

Before you left for vacation I had tried to reach you regarding the MG

resources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence 
efforts and longer term in the assimilation.  As in my voice mail, I believe 
that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a 
controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they 
run their business.  It seems that might help jump start the plans around how 
best to assimilate the business.  I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson, 
as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already 
been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and 
in other locations.  Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell  who 
seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.   I don't know the 
names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is 
unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.  We can 
hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning.    ",Non Abusive

planned.  Let me know once you've finalized the date.

For the training, there are only three people in Energy Operations doing

Subject: Reorganization/Promotion

We are in the process of reorganizing several functional groups within Gas 
Operations.  With this change, we want to promote Jeff Gossett to Manager 
effective May 1.  The following describes the reorganization and 
justification for the promotion.

The Risk Management, Operational Analysis, Transport Rates and Deal 
Validation groups will be realigned into four regional teams and managed by 
Business Controllers.  There will also be a centralized Controls group with 
2-3 individuals that will be managed by a different Business Controller.  
With this realignment, we are creating five new manager positions (four 
regional and one Controls) and eliminating the two manager positions for the 
Deal Validation and the Operational Analysis/Transport Rates groups.  The 
regional Business Controllers will be responsible for managing the day-to-day 
activities of their regional teams, including interacting with the Trading 
Desk Directors, and the Controls manager will work across the regional teams 
to ensure consistency and efficiency in our processes.

The new Controller positions will be filled as follows:

West - Jeff Gossett 
Central - Carrie Hollomon
East - Will Kelly (Senior Specialist)
Controls - Kathryn Cordes
Texas - TBD (Brenda Herod to hire)

We are promoting Jeff Gossett at this time due to the responsibilities he 
will be carrying in the Controller role in addition to his current 
responsibilities for the NGP&L and Benchmark functions.   

Will Kelly's performance will be evaluated during the next few months to 
determine if he will be the permanent Controller for the East region.  If he 
performs well in this role, mid-year promotion will be pursued.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I will follow-up next week to 
discuss a salary adjustment for Jeff Gossett.

Thanks,

Susan

tomorrow morning to be at 100%.  I will try to call you on my way into the

Sally,
We had a good meeting with James last week - I hope you have had the
opportunity to talk with him about it. What are the next steps? Would you
like to get together and have a mini-planning session on developing the
business maturity model around your business opportunities? We got a chance
to talk with James a little on that front, but he is not sure where your
thinking is on some of these approaches. I believe that is the best way to
get the changes you are seeking and accomplish the other business objectives
at the same time. Please let me know.

Hi, Sally--am sure you are glad to be back from cold, dark, cruel Oklahoma!

We will need to drive over early Saturday.  Brigeda has an art lesson at 4pm
on Fridays so we wouldn't be able to hit the road until pretty late.

Found out this morning she has pneumonia--has had a cough I decided I should
check out--although she is not contagious and is staying in school...

Brigeda went shopping with your Gap card this weekend--she thought it was
just too cool.  She is very conservative with money so she shopped the sale
racks.  I stayed out of the selection process totally--certainly a sign of
things to come!  She picked out two jean skirts and two shirts--no doubt she
will wear them to your house--I believe that she is trying to look/dress
like Amanda.  (I did, however, dissuade her from buying the leather
pants--told her that would be way too sweaty!)

Looking forward to seeing you all on Saturday.  We'll plan to hit the road
by 9.

Cindy

Subject: Re: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns
  

Sally,

Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly 
to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as 
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very 
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that 
you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you 
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that 
momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most 
don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I 
have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we 
wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to 
accomplish with their guidelines.

Please keep me up informed on this matter.

Thanks and good luck with the students.

Subject: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns


While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with excelr, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on excelr's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
excelr by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that excelr is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which excelr recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the excelr message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for excelr extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many excelr participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.

to know that I got an email from Cara--she's had a couple of offers for
showers--and is having a hard time deciding what to do (hmm...what a
surprise!).  Anyway, am not sure where our offer stands--we'll see.  I told
her to do whatever is best for her (while thinking:  if she doesn't choose
our shower invitation it will affect my gift!)

Will try to pin her down...

dance that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and
a winter party for Cotillion.  I believe that these are three weekends in a

well (and I will need a rest from formal affairs!).  Does that work for

Hi...

Talked to the little mother-to-be.  She said a shower would be grand.  She
has some big presentation mid-January.  How does late January sound to you.
Should we set a date now?  Am I turning into Mother?

Hi Sally,

I am so excited to see you and your family.  For your written
records...we'll in be Austin from Oct 27- Oct 31.  Then, we'll travel to
Houston via the Blue Bell ice cream factory on Nov 1st -- our plane leaves
from Houston on Sat, Nov 4th about 12:30.  Doing something on Friday with
Rebecca and Tyler sounds great -- she's pretty much up for anything.

Let me know what you hear from Mo -- it would be wonderful to see her, too.
Paul and I were starting to worry that something bad had happened in her
life!  It has been so long since we have talked to her.

This week's issue of Business Week has excelr in a list of the top 50
companies who are making the Internet work for them in running their
business  -- the focus for excelr was on the different trading operations,
highlighting trading broadband capacity.  I read BW weekly and excelr seems
to be in there a lot.

Take Care,

Subject: timing of submitting information to Risk Controls

Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk 
management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for 
Merchant Asset group)
12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

Thank you,

Shona Wilson

recently, one in Dallas and one in San Antonio.  We have been making the

I have heard from Stephanie, and she, Paul and Rebecca are headed to Texas at 
the end of October/beginning of November.  She will be interviewing students 
at UT on October 30 and 31 and then she and her family will be in Houston

another!  She is an older woman, but I am sure that they do well.  By the

she will be about six months pregnant.

Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts 
on the cover note ?  

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message ( it is a European note )and the means of delivery.  On 
the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully 
understand the intent.  Is there an article to be included in an excelr 
publication ( yes )and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if 
so, to whom will the letter be sent)?  Or is the letter from John an 
introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?  ( Yes - apologies 
if there is confusion )

With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure excelr top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
excelr to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  
Agreed - but the note was targeted at Europe - would welcome the opportunity 
to work on this with you and Shona )

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  Can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to 
Shona

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally  - Certainly not  - and thanks

Fernley  / Sally

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
summary ).

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
excelr Europe newsletter )

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

Fernley:  I think that you are right about easy access to the standards.  In 
fact, at the Global Operations Controllers gathering in Houston in October, 
we are going to roll out a website created for Global Risk Operations.  The 
global standards will be one of the items included, as well as contact lists 
for Operations Controllers worldwide, calendars for all excelr offices 
worldwide, a ""what time is it there if I am here"" page, etc.  I would like 
for this to be introduced at the offsite as surprise (just a little bang out 
of the announcement) , so I would appreciate your not sharing this plan 
widely at this point.  However, I thought that I would let you know so that 
we would not duplicate any efforts.

Fernley  / Sally

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
summary ).

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
excelr Europe newsletter )

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts 
on the cover note ?  

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message and the means of delivery.  On the means of delivery, I 
am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.  Is 
there an article to be included in an excelr publication and in addition a 
letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be 
sent)?  Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead 
in to the article?  

With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure excelr top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
excelr to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally

Sisters.....this  one made me laugh out loud....more than  once....?


Ingredients:
1 cup of water
1 tsp baking soda
1 cup  of sugar
1 tsp salt
1 cup of brown sugar
lemon juice
4 large  eggs
nuts
1 bottle Vodka
2 cups of dried fruit

Sample the vodka  to check quality. Take a large bowl, check the vodka again.
To be sure it is  the highest quality, pour one level cup and drink.

Repeat.

Turn on  the electric mixer. Beat one cup of butter in a large fluffy bowl.
Add one  teaspoon of sugar. Beat again. At this point it's best to make sure 
the vodka is  still OK.

Try another cup .... just in case. Turn off the  mixerer.

Break 2 leggs and add to the bowl and chuck in the cup of dried  fruit.

Pick fruit off floor.

Mix on the turner.

If the  fried druit gets stuck in the beaterers pry it loose with a  
sdrewscriver.

Sample the vodka to check for tonsisticity.

Next,  sift two cups of salt. Or something. Who giveshz a shit.

Check the  vodka.

Now shift the lemon juice and strain your nuts.

Add one  table.

Add a spoon of sugar, or somefink. Whatever you can  find.

Greash the oven and piss in the fridge.

Turn the cake tin  360 degrees and try not to fall over.

Don't forget to beat off the  turner.

Finally, throw the bowl through the window, finish the vodka and  kick the 
cat.

Fall into bed.

you have listed, he wants to include only Cindy Horn.  

I have thought more about Heidi Mason and Jan-Erland and think that they 
should be included.  While they do roll into Europe and also have a tie to 
accounting, they are the individuals in Sydney and Toyko that we are 
depending on to stress and enforce controls.  Heidi particularly does have 
active responsibility for risk, confirmations and settlements on a day-to-day 
basis.  And in addtion to their role reporting in to Europe, we are looking 
to them to oversee controls for other non-EEL traded commodities in their 
locations - weather, coal, etc.

I will include Fernley on the invitation list, as I had mentioned the meeting 
to him when I saw him in San Antonio.  He can certainly respectfully

Mike Wellings - UK Power
Coralie Evans - Continental Power
Robert Yeo - UK and Continental Gas
Paul D'Arcy - Structured Products
David Wall - Credit
Tim Poullain-Patterson - Metals Integration

present Kevin for Financial Trading and Howard Carter for Merchanting )

I would leave Ralph Jaeger of Frankfurt out of the offsite if places are 
restricted  - He is covered by the mainstream Accounting conferences, but I 
would have Jan Erland, and Heidi and Tiong Hock from Singapore.

I am not sure Fernley would want to be there - but I can ask.

On others  - Simon Thurbin of liquids in london should be in Houston and 
would be a good choice for inclusion. Brent may want his two London 
controllers of Cindy Horn and Kenny Nicoll to also come

Would you invite Kristen to come with( in place of Barry? ).

A long list ( and we may want to cut back ) but all these individuals carry 
the burden of operational risk assessment and management - standardising that 
process would be an achievement indeed.

kids, I think that we will pass on those single tickets.  The kids love our 
home tradition for the game, and weren't sure that they wanted to give that 
up. (I have cake pans in the shape of the state of Texas and the state of 
Oklahoma - one daugther decorates one, and the other decorates the second 
cake - add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate 
party!) 

We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on 
that last game of the season. However, Klein High School has started the 
football season very strongly, winning all games to date.  That means that we 
may be headed for high school playoffs again this year.  Meagan is on the 
drill team and must be at all games.  Last year, we played right up to 
Thanksgiving in the playoffs.  So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the 
spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with Meagan. 

We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.  Do you 
have a list of what is available for those schools?

Thanks for the nice words. I hope excelr will be able to look at some
students for summer internships, as I am sure they will be gone by Spring.

As far as Texas tickets go, I can come up with 5 singles, but not 5 together
or even 3 and 2. Let me know if interested and I will try to get them. Might
be able to trade up or something.

Let me know what other schools you are talking about and I can find out for
you.

Again, thank you for taking time out your schedule to come up and be a part
of the OU recruiting effort. It has been your support and efforts that we
have to thank for excelr coming to OU. Keep me posted on what you work out
with HR with regards to summer interns.

It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week.  As always, I
appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards.
I am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody
and Nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table.  You have
done a great job in changing and promoting the program.

I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer
interns ASAP.  I have also left Mike McConnell a message to make him aware
of the issue.  I should be able to get back with you next week, hopefully
with a change in our strategy!

If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets, please let me know.  We
will certainly purchase them, I just made the assumption that all tickets
may already be sold.

On another note, David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of
compliments.  He has a number of people that have asked him about school
shirts, caps, etc.  Do you have a list of the schools that you can get
merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get?  Let me know
-- we can probably place a few orders through you!

I have begun initial interviews this week. I started with Gas Trading 
Operations and will be moving on to Global Services next week (Shona Wilson, 
Mary Solmonson, James Scribner, Scott Mills and Sheri Thomas).  I hope to get 
to your group the week after next.  However, I will be calling next week to 
set up interviews with both you and your Directors.

Everything is progressing according to plan and I still expect  the analysis 
to be completed by mid November.

I hope this helps.  Please call me if you have any questions.  I can be 
reached at X39437.

I look forward to meeting you and your group.

Russell - as I remember, Willie finaled the Supply Verification and it was 
interfaced to SAP.  This is fine, and then Willie was going to net the A/P 
and A/R.  SAP went down after the statement was interfaced, but before Willie 
was able to block or net the payment.  When SAP came back up the next day, 
the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire.  If 
you have any further questions about this, call me.  Thanks.

Willie,

Per our earlier conversation, can you or Audrey or Bryce, please give further 
explain to me as to why the funds were wired to Perry Gas for purchases from 
the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales.  
You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty's that net on 
SAP, although because of timing, the override did not take place.

Thank you,

23932,beck-s/_sent_mail/21.,<21149872.1075855913079.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Whew!! Your schedule makes me tired!  I am sure that Brigeda is happy that 
you are involved in so many activities with her school - and then on the 
other hand, sometimes you wonder if they notice!  Work sounds crazy for you, 
but how nice that you will be off from December 21 until the 2nd.  

I hope that make it over the week before Christmas.  The week is kind of 
crazy for us, so I am trying to find a time that will work.  Sunday the 17th 
we are having a dessert party at our house, inviting neighbors, old Huntwick 
friends, etc.  It is for families, and Meagan and Amanda each included 4 of 
their friends in the invitiation list, along with their familities.  It will 
be multi-generational - I hope fun, as it would be a nice tradition to 
continue.  On Monday, I think that David plans to take Tyler and Amanda to 
Longview for a visit.  A commitment that Meagan and I have to sort toys at 
Northwest Assistance Ministries from 12:30 to 4:00 that day has excused us 
from the trip.  So it may be best for Meagan and me to drive over to Austin 
after 4:00 on Monday.  We could be back by the time David and company return 
to Houston on Tuesday afternoon.  Wednesday we have matinee tickets to see A 
Christmas Carol at the Alley  Theater, sans Tyler.  Thursday I am having all 
of my girls in NCL over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for 
Christmas and then we will deliver the presents.  And Friday is Tyler's 
birthday, with a 102 Dalmation theme planned (cake ordered from RJ Goodies, 
but nothing else done yet!).  So I really think that our only shot to make it 
to Austin is for Monday night, which would mean only Meagan and me.  

I talked with Mom last night and invited Dad and her to Houston for 
Christmas.  I don't really think that they will come, but if they do, I hope 
that doesn't mess up your Christmas.  They have only been here for one or two 
Christmases with us since we have had kids.  I think that Tyler at 3 this 
year will be particularly enthralled.  And next year they will have 2 
grandchildren in Austin, so it just seemed that this could be a good year for 
them to come.  She said she would think about it, and I told her that I 
wanted her to know that we would love to have them, but that it was perfectly 
okay if they decided that they did not want to come.  

How about Dad playing golf this week?  What a difference!! I am so glad that 
he is doing better.  

I hear you about Mom.  I think that a blow-up or some drama is highly 
predictable, unfortunately.  She seems to do that a lot at special occassions 
for Cara, doesn't she?  I will certainly help in any way I can.  And I will 
be very interested in the gosipy details.  

Happy baking!    I do have to make 5 batches of fudge tonight and tomorrow 
night so that I can attend a cookie exchange luncheon on Saturday armed with 
27 packages of fudge.

Subject: RE: Baby Shower


Got your message last night--sorry I missed you--must have been in the
shower.  We are all going nuts here, too.  We have a huge deadline here at
work.  But I worked most of last weekend so am ahead of the curve.  Good
thing, since I have volunteered to be Martha Stewart at many school events
this week and next.  LAst night was ""lessons and carols"" by the school
choir--with me decorating, baking, and coordinating.  Today I go to school
to make Christmas stockings with the kids--Sunday is the school Christmas
Bazaar at the Four Seasons--need to bring an item for the bake sale.  Also
need to start baking 12 gingerbread houses for Brigeda's class.    Did find
a matching mold to the smaller one we have so I can at least bake two at
once--twelve bakes is MUCH better than 24!  And then there is that dollhouse
that needs my attention by the 25!

I am totally ok with us not doing the shower.  We get credit for offering
but don't have to do anything.  Both money and time are in such short supply
for me that it works out for the best.  At work we start on a contract for
Dell in January.  The company is also going to pay for Java programming
classes for some of us (if I can nail this down then I can jump up to a
programmer level on that pay scale).  I also have a private contract job
with a needlepoint store in Memphis to setup their website.

Am somewhat concerned that Mother will have one of her dramas when Cara's
baby comes...you know she will get her feelings hurt somehow.  Not to
mention the fact that she will be sharing the grandchild with ""the most
selfish woman on earth.""  Richard and Brigeda went out to the Lowrimore farm
(they sold it and offered us all of the firewood).  Jane couldn't have been
sweeter to Brigeda--spent a lot of time with her.  Can just imagine that
""pained"" look in Mother's face at the hospital.  If you are not here may
need you to carry your cell phone so I can call for moral support--or at
least give you gossipy updates on the drama....

Are you planning to come later this month when you are off?  I'm taking off
the 21st and 22nd--they have given all of the technical production staff the
days between Christmas and New Years as comp time so I will be off until the
2nd...

Well, she declined our kind offer, didn't she?  As busy as life is between

punch!  Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.  I

Hope you all are doing fine.  I was on jury duty three days last week -

In addition to these monthly operating reports, we are working on a daily

Thanks for calling in list to me yesterday.  Sally is trying to juggle her 
calendar in order that she will be able to attend presentation on Sept. 28.  
Her plan at this point, is to attend dinner & presentation on 28th but not 
dinner on the 27th.  Unfortunately, her schedule will not allow her to be out 
on Thursday.  She was also wondering about details of dinner - said in the 
last meeting it had been discussed to possibly do a western theme - with 
jeans (?).  Is that still on?  If not, is dinner to be held at Stone Davis 
Hall?  Can I get the address of Stone Davis & address, phone, & fax for 
Wellesley Inn for Sally's itinerary.

Thanks,

that I should review the resumes, pass them to Brent for his review, and then 
on to Causey for his review.  Considering our schedules and the large number 
of resumes to review, that would have been an impossible task to complete by 
Thursday at noon.  I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday, just before 
leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma.  I asked Patti to 
make a copy of the packet for Brent, and I knew that Rick would not want to 
take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening 
first.  I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way 
back to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of 
the business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training 
class.  We got those to Rick today by noon, as he was leaving the office.  I 
believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will 
pass the resumes along to you.  Since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this 
morning after Brent and I had done our reviews, you will have to 
cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.  

Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the 
resumes as well.  I would suggest that in the future that your team should 
make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the 
review.  The plan of passing them from one person to another is not 
practical,  and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.  If you 
are going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time 
frame, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.  If someone from 
you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that 
would have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes.  
Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes 
of MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not 
Analysts interviews.  Please give us organized information to react to, not 
simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.  All of us want to 
participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process, but 
we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and 
organizational work.  

I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program 
and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role, not being 
critical.  I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.

23943,beck-s/_sent_mail/22.,<23808046.1075855913102.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"As you know, exceeding this limit would require contacting the excelr Board of 
Directors.  Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.  In 
conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily 
report from Ted on component V@R.  Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston 
time) to let me know about this requirement.  Obviously, we want to meet 
Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and  complete 
as possible.  Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over 
the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be 
excluded from the first run of component V@R.  (Mike:  I assume that you are 
very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send 
to the daily 8:30 meeting.)  

I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh 
and me at 4:00 today.  Realizing that the time was very late in London, we 
tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in 
the meeting.  Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that 
Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.  

Here is the key fact to know:  It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R 
calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.  The 
Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing 
an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.   With this 
timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by 
approximately 10:00 am Houston time.  


Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R 
including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power) 
will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston 
time (10:00 am London time).  If this time frame is not met, then component 
V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.  We had hoped to discuss this with 
you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support 
and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London 
requirement for officialized books.  

The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on 
what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread 
options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.  Those V@R calculations 
that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the 
component V@R calculations.  While there are other commodities that will 
currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less 
material than the UK spread options.  Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of 
days before this is completed.  Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of 
this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.  

I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the 
UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time.  
We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.  It is 
probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and 
systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report 
earlier in the morning.  

Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or 
not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently 
meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London.    ",Non Abusive

study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President.  
This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.

has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and 
above.

Todd Burke, who recently joined excelr, will be conducting the market survey 
and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful 
experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are

your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the

vested interest in the success of this project!

Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and 
below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of 
Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for 
key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate 
further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.

You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will

Subject: social security

Hi Mary,
One other thing I wanted to mention to you today, it looks like someone is 
trying to use my social security number.  Like Mary Gosnell, I've been 
alerted by a financial institution on an attempt made.  Coincidently, the 
application says I work for the Herman Hospital which is the same for Mary G, 
so it looks like there is an excelr element connecting the two of cases 
together.  I've called the director of security and excelr's in-house police 
officer (who works from the excelr building M/W/F).  Security is looking into 
churn requests and the implementation of the new SAP system to see if there's 
a leak.

Joel had also overheard someone discussing this same subject in the elevator 
a few weeks past, so it doesn't look like it's isolated to Global Data 
Management.

Fortunately for me, nothing has come from the attempts - given I'm new to the 
country and have no established credit rating....I have taken the appropriate 
action so I don't think this will be too big of an issue.

Thanks,
Avril

Subject: We Need You


Some of you were contacted earlier this year by Cliff Baxter, excelr's 
representative on the Junior Achievement Board of Directors, regarding 
participation in excelr's Junior Achievement program.  Since so many changes 
have occurred within ENA since that time, we are renewing our request and 
broadening it to reach more departments.

One of the programs that we wish to support through Junior Achievement is Job 
Shadowing.  This program's objectives are to demonstrate why a sound 
education, interpersonal skills, and a strong work ethic are needed to 
succeed in the work place.  A successful Job Shadowing program requires your 
department's commitment and participation.

The Job Shadowing program consists of the following:

 9:00 - 10:30 AM  Welcome, Company Overview, Video, and Tour 
 10:30 - 12:00 N  Job Shadow Experience with excelr Employees and/or 
Departments
 12:00 - 1:00 PM  Lunch for Students with Mentors and Closing Comments

excelr has agreed to accept 16 high school juniors and seniors on the second 
Wednesday of each month from October 2000 through April 2001.  We need your 
assistance in hosting students within your department during the 10:30 AM - 
12:00 Noon period.   Students may be either paired up one-on-one with 
employees or may remain in groups of 2-4.  Employees participating in Job 
Shadowing will also be invited to join their students for a quick lunch and 
closing comments.  If enough departments participate, it is possible that 
each department may only be needed on a quarterly basis.

Although we have identified two individuals to provide the company overview 
and tour, we are also accepting additional volunteers in this area.  Please 
advise if anyone in your department is interested in assisting.

Please provide the following information to Nicki Daw or Susan Skarness by 
August 30, 2000.

 Department Name:

 Job Shadowing Contact Name:

 Number of Students:

 Individual to Assist With Tours:

We appreciate your consideration and participation in promoting Junior 
Achievement and excelr.

Subject: SAP Initiative

Sally - it was great seeing you last week at the ASE in Dallas.  I'm sorry we 
didn't have the opportunity to work together in any of the groups.  As you 
may know,  I have just completed the SAP HR Implementation Project and my 
current role, working for Andrea Yowman, is to maximize our investment in SAP 
HR.
  
To that end, next Thursday, 9/14, two people from SAP will be here to 
interview non-HR managers on a new project as described below.  You have been 
identified as an excellent resource to participate in this effort, and I 
would appreciate it if you would be able to spend 1/2 hour with this team and 
have your admin spend another hour with them as well -- times noted below.

Please let me know if you are available and willing to participate in this 
initiative.  It is the beginning of our ongoing relationship with SAP to 
develop what excelr needs, and your input is considered invaluable to this 
process.  Please respond with your availability at the times noted below and 
I will prepare a final agenda and itinerary early next week.

Thanks for your consideration to participate in this effort.  If you have any 
questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to call me at 
3-0363.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Proposed agenda
We would like to interview managers and their administrators.

 9:30 - 10:00 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#1
10:00 - 11:00 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#1
  
 1:00 -  1:30 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#2
 1:30 -  2:30 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#2

 2:30 -  3:00 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#3
 3:00 -  4:00 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#3

What is this project?
SAP is developing new software for managers that will be integrated with the
Workplace. It will be flexible and powerful enough to support managers at
all levels and in all industries. This project is supported directly by the
HR Desktop Manager group and has been endorsed by top managers throughout
SAP in the U.S. and Germany.

SAP has learned that to produce great software products we have to get close
to our end users. To do that, we need your help. Our goal is to visit eight
SAP customers in the U.S. excelr is one of the eight companies we would like
to visit.

Who do we want to interview and observe?
In a one-day visit, we want to observe and interview three types of
managers.
* High-level manager, involved in strategic planning, overall budget
responsibilities, strategic direction. The high-level manager tends to
delegate most of his daily and weekly activities to subordinates.
* Operational manager, involved in running a large department or small
subsidiary. Often reports to the high-level manager. Has budget and
personnel responsibility for the department or subsidiary. May also have
product-planning responsibilities.
* Group manager, primarily focused on a business activity such as
accounts payable manager, line manager, or production planner; but also
involved in managing a small group. Often has hands-on personnel and
lower-level budget responsibilities. Concerned with the day-to-day business.

What can you expect during a site visit?
We have found that the most efficient way to organize our interviews is to
meet with a contact person in your company (that would be me) who will then 
escort us to our
interviews. This allows our team to introduce themselves and explain their
objectives.  Our interviews are conducted at the managers' workstations
where our team will spend about 1/2 hour observing the manager in his/her
daily work and asking questions.  We will then spend the next hour with 
his/her
administrative assistant.

Interviewees do not have to prepare anything. We prefer to interview people
where they work because often the work environment can give us a lot of
insights about what managers need from a software product. We ask people to
be completely honest and forthcoming with us. We treat all sensitive
information with utmost confidentiality.

There will be two teams from SAP meeting with a total of 6 managers and 
administrative assistants from 
various areas in various business units.

Subject: baby shower / dates


Hi, Sal!    I've been meaning to call you for several days - but it's been a
bit of a madhouse, so I thought I might fire off an e-mail:

I don't know if you've talked with Cindy in the past few days - but, if it's
okay with you, I'd like to decline your very sweet offer of having a baby
shower.   Here's the deal:  A couple of friends had already offered to do
one - and I'm having trouble coming up with a vibrant mix of people to split
amongst two showers.
This seems to be a good decision for Cindy, too, since may be a bit short of
cash and energy right now.

However, I would LOVE for you to come to the one shower - if it's convenient
for you.  I would love for you to meet my friends, and for them to meet you!
If it doesn't work for you, I'll certainly understand - especially since you
may want to come again when baby is born.  But, if you'd like to consider
coming, I'd like to know your schedule.  We're talking about a weekend lunch
or afternoon thing I think.   In January or February, I""m available on the
following weekends:
Jan. 20
Jan. 27
Feb. 17
Feb. 24.
I think going any later than this might be cutting it close!    What I need
from you is to know which of these weekends you might be available.   The
""shower planners"" are getting eager to plan.  THANKS! -cara

Dear Sally,

Hope you had a good trip to Dallas, although it was a bit interrupted with
you trip back to Houston for Meagan's Open House.  Dad and I would like be
with you all on Friday the 20th of October.  I believe that may have been the
game we attended last year too.  We have meetings, the other two dates, so if
that still works for you we will plan on that date.  It also gives Dad a bit
more time to hopefully get his voice.  He returns to ""DR"" Bob Raley, week
after next for the results of all the testing he did this week.

Glad you will be over on Tuesday-we will look forward to seeing you then and
glad you will have time for a visit after lunch tool.

Love,

know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources 
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to ""catch up"", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going 
basis.   

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS 
as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production 
support will be managed and how development work will be effectively 
handled.

resulted in her being removed from the transplant list.  Randy has a four

helpful for you to put a call in to Tom Martin today to give him your phone

you are available for any questions.  Nothing may come up, but I think that 
Tom would feel better with this gesture.  Probably wouldn't hurt to log the 
same call or e:mail in to the rest of the guys on the list.  That will give 
all of them a feeling of continuity with regard to information from Dave on 
this project.  Do you have contact information for Brenda?  If not, I would 
get that from Yvette Convey, her assistant.  She is making the rounds with 
Patrick Conner and the corporate development team, doing site visits on two

Subject: Project Triple Lutz

To date, my primary duties have been to oversee the internal valuation of the 
contracts, and their unwind costs in our Risk books.  I have also been 
involved with the Entex contract valuation.  Dave Baumbach has been the real 
key to providing the data, and has all of the information.  Steve Jackson is 
talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional 
eyes and resources looking at this also.  I feel we have done a thorough job, 
but we do need everyone thinking of ""what if's.""  Our risk books are complex, 
with many hand-offs internally.  Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of 
the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the 
day.  I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.  After our 
meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our 
approach.  There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on 
(Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).

FYI:  I will be out of town on another project all of the week of 8/28 - 9/1, 
and Tuesday, 9/5 and Wednesday, 9/6.  I have made arrangements to ensure that 
I am in Houston on Thursday, 9/7 and Friday, 9/8 for the first visit to the 
Triple Lutz data room.  

In my absence next week, I want to reiterate to each of you that I am 
available, and will have the Triple Lutz data with me.  If any issues come up 
that you feel I can be helpful, please contact yvette Connevey @ 
713-853-5953, and she will get in touch with me.  Once again, DO NOT HESITATE

We have reviewed the proposed Global Standards and would like to propose two 
changes for the Calgary office:

 Function:    Deal Confirmation
 Standard:  Brokered deals confirmed within 24 hours (versus the proposed 
same day)

 Function:    Deal Confirmation
 Standard:  Deliver confirmation within 48 hours (versus the proposed 24 
hours)

In order for us to meet the originally proposed standards, we would either 
require additional staffing or a reduction of the review process for our 
transactions.
Let me know if you have any questions or require additional clarification.  I 
can be reached at ext. 6753.

As I discussed in the staff meeting, I am sending you the global standards 
for your review and comment.  Please review these standards to determine if:

The targets set are reasonable for your business and
As minimum standards, they are comprehensive enough (if you would like to see 
additional reporting)

Lastly, in the upcoming month we will start to implement exception reporting 
for these standards.  Please let us know who the key contact in your 
department would be for this implementation.

Please address all correspondence to Michael Moscoso.

fly to Bermuda from Texas.  Easy from New York, but not that much traffic 
between Houston/Austin and there.  A few years ago when we went with David's 
family to Yellowstone, we were able to get a great deal through Continental 
through their group rate department. That works when you travel with a group 
of 10 or more, all on the same itinerary.  I think that our round trip from 
Salt Lake to Houston was $235 each.  Hopefully we could arrange something 
like that.   If airfare is more like $1,000 between here and Bermuda, that 
could be tough.  

Should we pin them down on an exact location, maybe have them pick two or 
three and rank them?  Then we could check on accomodations, airfare, deals, 
etc. to see what would be most feasible.  Or should we research a few places 
and present those choices for them to consider?  What do you think?  Seems 
like there will be 13 of us, counting baby White/Lowrimore.  And what do you 
and Cara envision -- a weekend, a few days, a week?  Our kids will get out of 
school on Friday, May 25.  The 2nd of June is that following Saturday.  

We are having a great year here at excelr, especially in the business unit 
that I am in.  Hopefully, that translates to really great bonuses in early 
February.  I hope to be in a position to fund airfare and hotel for 
everyone.

I will look forward to seeing you there. 

Will you be in Dallas next week for the ASE?  I will be there.  I did let 
Melissa know when the dates were announced that I will quietly slip out about 
mid afternoon on Thursday.  Amanda's school open house is Thursday at 7:00, 
and parents will follow their children's schedules and meet all of the 
teachers.  With this being Amanda's   first year in junior high, it is 
important for me to meet the teachers and understand their expectations so 
that I can best support her in school.  Mary Solmonson and Brent from my team

Sally, I think will get out and do an Indian Rain dance, as the rain is
falling and we need lots ot that!  MY reason for writing however, is to say
that we will look forward to your having lunch with us at 12:15 on September
5th at the University of Texas Club.  Cindy said you would be in town and
that would be a fun celebration, and Cindy and family will join us.  I am
also going to invite my cousins, Fab and Mary Anne.  Cara will in New York at
that time.

The other is, I am thrilled that you and your family are going to be able to
go to Hallettsville for Dot's birthday and Cindy, Richard, and Brigeda will
be able to be there also as they were able to change their plans for the
beach to the following week-end, so I think it will be lots of  fun, and I
know it will mean a lot to Dot too.  In fact I called her today and told her
you all were going to be able to be there.  Cara will decide when she gets
home from CA I guess,  She will be home from New York on the 7th.

Love,

I decided to take her up on it.  She just moved her daughter back to Baylor, 
so she was to begin calling the girls on Monday this week (I had given her a 
list of names and numbers).  I talked with Linda Smithey this morning and she 
had not heard from Beverly yet, either, so I am concerned that she hasn't 
called everyone on the list.  I took Meagan in on Monday night to choose 
outfits, and Beverly had some great ideas on music, commentary, etc., so I 
know that she is working on it.  Just a little more slowly than I would

Sally, 
In answer to your question regarding the approval process for sign on 
bonuses, Sheila Walton informed me of the following. 
If you are primarily in agreement regarding a small sign on bonus award,  
then no further approval process is necessary.     If the sign on bonus 
amount is substantial then approval from David Oxley is advisable.   
In our current case, a $5,000.00 sign on for a Sr. Specialist would not 
require additional approval except your own.   
I will continue to monitor sign on bonus offers and provide you with a 
recommendation based on all available factors.

As most of you should know, we are scheduled to participate in the MPA Dinner

this event with KPMG, so our presence is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!!

With this in mind, I am hoping that you will make yourself available to

Please respond via e-mail or give me a call (3-4585) and let me know if you 
will be able to represent excelr at this event.  I will then give you the 
logistics for the event.  It is scheduled to begin at 6:30, so we are 
expected to arrive between 6:00 and 6:15.

Please let me know ASAP if you will be able to help.

as the spot I am sure that we can find something good.  We were in Ashville a 
couple of years ago, which was very near the Blue Ridge.  We stayed at a 
place that was supposed to be terrific, but we did not care for it.  I am 
sure that there are other places in the area to research.  There may also be 
some spots around Charlottesville, also just off the Blue Ridge.  I think 
that some people from here have vacationed in that area, so I will ask around 
and see if there are any good suggestions.  In magazines, I have seen

Met Mom and Dad for dinner last night.  I did some pushing for the

adamant?  What a shock!).  What did seem to appeal was a trip to the

Two weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that 
receives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to find 
out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused  
Houston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster 
parents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to 
the center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin 
and meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were 
temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to 
have made that pledge.  

excelr has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive 
matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit 
organizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your 
charitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one time 
each year that excelr invites employees to partner with the company to make a 
difference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by an 
employee is matched by excelr.  

If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing 
so as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next 
Wednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making a 
pledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all excelr 
employees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.  Log on to

 As a follow-up to the recent excelr Corp. memorandum forming excelr Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, excelr Americas; Mark Evans, excelr Europe; Mark Taylor, 
excelr Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, excelr Global Markets; Julia Murray, excelr 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, excelr Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Subject: Trading v Origination Offices

Sally, Brent,
There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by excelr, acted much as trading offices.
Shona and Naomi have worked with the people in New York to put in place extra 
controls so that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in 
New York or London own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate, and some execute for Trading Offices.

is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
All the cc above are bought in to this approach.
What do you require to be comfortable so that we can put it up to Causey and 
Buy?

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Thanks,
Richard

interested (nor available) for a month's worth of work.  Todd's tendency 
(remember this with weather, too) is to think that he has to do all of the 
work himself.  He has had enough experience that his organization, guidance 
and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work 
himself.  If James' list looks long and involved, how could Todd lead these 
efforts, what kind of team might he ask James to provide, what additional 
short-term resources might we be able to tap into in Houston, etc.  We have 
to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to James.  If 
you are willing, I would be glad to explore this with Todd and challenge him

I don't see any huge problems with Todd helping out Continental Power.  He 
needs to spend some time in Oslo anyways reviewing the weather business 
there.  I agree that one month might be unreasonable and would look to Todd 
to determine the proper timeframe.  I will talk to Todd and Mike Jordan

As we said before, I would like to be able to utilize Todd Hall for special

completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of 
his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely 
with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.  I don't know about the one 
month timeframe.  I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and 
determine the best way to proceed.  It might mean a couple of weeks over 
there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.  I 
don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly 
without the family.  Can we still use Todd ?

Sally,

As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well 
but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or 
another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable. 
Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible 
for much of what we achieved.

As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been 
significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now 
recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the 
29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas 
Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.

There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit 
from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I 
am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in Oslo 
pushing the weather Risk Management area forward). Attached is a page I put 
together that cover our immediate needs and why Todd is ideally placed to 
potentially add an enormous amount of value to the Continental Power business.

Could we please get together with Brent Price and Mike Jordan and discuss 
whether Todd would be available come over.

Thanks and regards James

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

plus the voice thing.  He went to the dr on Friday--I don't think they know

Subject: Meeting with Mark Frevert - Should We Move It Up?


Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation 
schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on 
August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I 
am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential 
formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind 
the curve.  

Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the 
structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on 
Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are 
flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in 
that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  
Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points 
will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation 
with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he 
wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he 
will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts 
are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly 
comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to 
report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic 
around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I 
had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility 
for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.  
That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that 
down before the end of the month.  

What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The 
summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have 
checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, 
with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  

I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August 
much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL 
operations.  I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, 
rather than arrive at the party late.

Hi Allan:

I  am  writing  you  to express my strong interest in working at excelr Net 
Works
International Private Equity.  I am confident that my experience has prepared 
me
with  the  broad  skills  and finance expertise necessary for success in 
Private
Equity.

The rigorous curriculum in the Anderson School at UCLA has not only confirmed 
my
interest in Finance, but also enhanced my accounting skills. After 
graduation, I
spent  the first four months of my rotation program in excelr at the Asia 
Pacific
Structuring  Group. There I honed my analytical skills, commercial knowledge 
and
cross-functional team experience through financial modeling and risk 
assessment.
I  provided  robust  analytical  support that resulted in a successful bid 
for a
$550  million  power  project in China.  In the past five months at the 
Business
Development   Group  of  excelr  Broadband  Services,  I  managed  the  
strategic
relationship  between  excelr  and  Microsoft. The deal management tasks 
required
broad-based   problem-solving   skills,   effective   communication  and  
strong
understanding  of  the technology market. Recently I also proposed and led a 
new
initiative in developing broadband online gaming content for the excelr 
streaming
media business.

I  have  attached  my resume which details my accomplishments. I look forward 
to
speaking with you and further discuss my credentials in a personal interview.

I wish that we could meet for lunch.  Keep me posted on Cara  -- I have 
called her a little more frequently lately in hopes that she would spill the 
beans, but no movement on that yet!  

I think that next week we will know the schedule of games when Meagan will be 
dancing.  She did not make the dance for the first try-out.  It was jazz;  
not her strong suit.  But she did make the dances for the next two try-outs:  
a kick rountine and a pom routine.  There are two more try outs -- one more 
for kick and one more for pom. Hopefully she will make both.  Each routines 
is danced at two games -- one at home and one away.  So if she makes the next 
two dances, then she will be in 8 out of 10 dances for the football season.  
I think that she would feel pretty good about that.  The last two try-outs 
will be next week.  I will keep you posted.

Sally,

Wish we could meet downtown for lunch--if only we weren't in different
downtown!

Bummer about Meagan--I agree that physics and precalc would be a killer.
You've probably looked into this but there are some great computer
""games/drills"" for math.  Brigeda does the early ones but there are some for
the heavy duty stuff as well...

Amanda must have aced that lock/locker and changing classes thing if she
loves her classes...

Brigeda doesn't start until the 21st.  It is always a strange week when all
the other kids (and her best friend) is in school--kind of waiting week but
we should be getting ready for her party.

GREAT IDEA:  I'm going to change the clocks in my house the night of the
slumber party--to 2 hour ahead.  So they can have their midnight swim and
snack (at 10pm!).  I don't know whether this makes me a creepy or clever
mom...

Let me know when you get Meagan's football schedule...Brigeda has been
moaning about wishing she was in Houston since we left...

Today is Cara's appt with the gyn/ob--maybe an announcement will be
forthcoming.

I'm meeting a guy I took my web certification classes with on Monday.  He
owns a design firm in Georgetown and has some freelance work.  It would be
great to be able to accelerate our return to solvency!

Talk to you soon...

Cindy

That was always one of my favorites!  The old Parent Trap is always great
too,  I wish that I could be there. I know that Brigeda must be excited
about the slumber party.  When does she start school?  Today is day #2 for
the girls --Amanda loves her classes.  Meagan thought that the first day
""sucked"".  I have been on the phone with her counselor and assistant
principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her
class selection.  Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she
signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!   I don't know what she was
thinking!!  Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive
enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 22
deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and
add a study hall.  She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars
class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which
is probably exactly what she needs.  I was prepared to go all the way to
the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but
luckily I didn't have to go that far.

Hope that you have a good weekend!  Love, sally

too,  I wish that I could be there. I know that Brigeda must be excited about 
the slumber party.  When does she start school?  Today is day #2 for the 
girls --Amanda loves her classes.  Meagan thought that the first day 
""sucked"".  I have been on the phone with her counselor and assistant 
principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her 
class selection.  Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she 
signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!   I don't know what she was 
thinking!!  Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive 
enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 22 
deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and 
add a study hall.  She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars 
class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which is 
probably exactly what she needs.  I was prepared to go all the way to the 
school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but luckily 
I didn't have to go that far.  

Hope that you have a good weekend!  Love, sally

suggested that Tom visit with both you and Mike while he was in London.  I 
told Mike that I support many of the ideas of CommodityLogic.  However, I 
also told him about my two dark-side fears:  (1)  that IT resources reporting 
to Networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on 
projects that we need, and (2)  taken to the extreme, that this concept would 
disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to 
managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this 
special team for them to handle.  Part of the fun in operations is improving 
things, and I would hate to rob some of our most knowledgeable people of the 
chance to implement creative business solutions.

Subject: CommodityLogic.com

Mike,
Further to our conversation, here are some of the things I thought of while 
speaking with Tom Gros. There are definitely some challenges we have to 
overcome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic.com as successful as 
excelrOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara.

I won't repeat thoughts about how we split CL from excelr, but let's put 
ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a 
potential solution. Well, that's an easy decision, somebody else is doing the 
hard work, and not charging us very much for it. So sign-up, but don't rely 
on anything until we see everything working.

Handling counterparties not using the system
The challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the 
Hub is wonderful, but until everybody is using the Hub, we have to keep other 
procedures and systems going, which stretches resources, Development, IT 
Support and user. This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero - the 
concept is wonderful, but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone 
else one trades with using the system. This is classic Chicken and Egg. Tom 
has a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this. This is taking us 
closer to an outsource-to-Andersen-consulting model which is certainly 
achievable, although not quite such an easy sell.

How much resource is left
The latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people, who 
are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving 
onwards. How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL, and 
then review what is left in the remaining environment. Does it mean we hold 
off doing anything? If we do then increasing volume means that we might end 
up incurring costs for massive numbers of people! We should go through 
costing for ""What happens if we completely stop development of X project?"". 
If that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else 
comes along then it may be cheaper than developing, but I hope in most cases 
it is not!

Start small to prove concept
E.g. first application in April 2001 only covers 20 fields
This is excellent, and we needn't shout it too loud to investors in CL, but 
for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be 
years before we can switch off many internal systems.
We might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 
years out?

Include European aspects from the beginning
This really isn't very difficult so long as one has some long-on-common-sense 
Europeans (not just Brits) involved in both specification and development 
from the beginning, but an as example of how not to do it, look at EnPower 
which took a year to allow just for currencies etc!

80-20 rule for types of transaction
EOL has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first.
Once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting (DTL) and risk 
(RisktRAC?) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on STP, 
and yet-to-become-vanilla products on explicitly different, manual 
approaches. Until that time, we have a strong desire to include as many 
different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system, which 
makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly (Think of 
certain deals in Power99 which are approximations of the actual deals, and 
manually tweaked every so often)

Testing
Tom's first thought is that we could leverage initial users (who would not 
pay) to do much of the testing.
EOL clearly got its testing done, but other experience shows that in order to 
have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different 
phases - component, system, integration, end-to-end, and then user-acceptance.
EOL saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many 
external users early in the process. It did have massive 
resource-commandability and so obtained input from many traders. Do the 
Support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the 
same sort of user attention? Given how often I hear ""short people"", that 
strikes me as something which in London would require significant additional 
resource, even after MG is absorbed.

What else did you come up with?
Richard

schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on 
August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I 
am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential 
formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind 
the curve.  

Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the 
structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on 
Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are 
flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in 
that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  
Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points 
will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation 
with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he 
wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he 
will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts 
are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly 
comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to 
report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic 
around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I 
had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility 
for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.  
That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that 
down before the end of the month.  

What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The 
summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have 
checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, 
with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  

I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August 
much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL 
operations.  I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, 
rather than arrive at the party late.  ",Non Abusive

Dear Rick:

As you may know, I have recently assumed the duties of PPA/MPA Director at
The University of Texas at Austin. In my new capacity, I shall be
responsible for the 2000 Fall Lyceum Series, scheduled by my predecessor,
Dr. Don Tidrick.

I understand that you will be addressing our 4th Year PPA students on
""Global Equity Markets"" in the Lyceum on Wednesday, November 1, from 5:00
to 6:30 p.m. (approximately), in UTC 2.102A. Both the students and I are
looking forward to your presentation.

In advance of the presentation, could you provide me with a brief biography
for introduction purposes?

If you have any questions concerning the Lyceum, or if I can facilitate
your Lyceum presentation in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Very truly yours,

Richard J. Joseph, Director

were on the 33rd floor where I was picking up United Way shirts that I didn't 
control my enthusiasm over seeing you.

I apologize if I disrupted you.

His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it 
would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on 
July 1.  Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth 
transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen 
would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance 
review being based on his work for ENA.  Stephen is very talented and will no 
doubt do a great job at EBS.  During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his 
heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct 
reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our 
other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.  It was his 
failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs 
Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.   It is the r
elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that 
category.

Todd tells me that a logo has been selected.  Can you e:mail that to me?  If 
not available electronically, I will see it when I am back in the office next 
Wednesday.   

If no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process 
and opportunities that may be presented there, I will do that when I am back 
in the office next week.  My first move will be to sit down with Jeff 
Sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours 
that James Scribner sent you.  When we look at numbers of confirmations and 
compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which 
activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed  
to absorb increased business more easily.  I also think that Jeff will be the 
best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to 
simply life at excelr and perhaps create value externally.  All of the 
advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system, 
auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm 
group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for 
implementation.  No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next.

To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1  

Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark 
Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right 
thing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the 
service to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as 
soon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs 
regularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider 
the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary 
when you meet with Mark.

First, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial 
confirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that 
time, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  
We now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in 
Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  

Second, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by 
Houston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep 
audit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent 
out after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are 
periodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in 
the confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the 
confirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the 
confirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big 
problem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, 
which is even a bigger problem.  

Third, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston 
generate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the 
transactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the 
confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by 
legal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if 
done by excelr Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the excelr Entity is excelr 
North America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the 
counterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of 
execution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the 
follow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary 
office.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same 
pre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where 
there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, 
or, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare 
our own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element 
of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are 
we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?

Fourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in 
Houston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has 
staff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are 
reviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, 
route them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is 
complete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on 
issues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading 
company financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the 
transactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these 
documents.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for 
the financial confirmations without adding any staff.

Fifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the 
confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  
Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the 
confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the 
transaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the 
financial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for excelr.

Finally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my 
existing employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the 
company in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of 
the documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas 
such as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to 
keep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the 
confirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already 
exists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full 
accountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity 
to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.

As a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring 
that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function 
properly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to 
get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this 
function to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the 
impression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I 
hope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to 
look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that 
exists here.

If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in 
this memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very 
strongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please 
let me know how your meeting with Mark goes.

Thanks,
Peggy

Just so that you are aware, we continue to have problems with the financial 
confirm process from Houston.  On more than one occasion, confirmations have 
been sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary.  Attached is the 
most recent one.   We have been assured over and over that this will not 
happen again, however, it continues to happen.  Luckily, this confirmation 
went out without any errors in it.  I know that you are very busy, but  is 
there any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the 
financial confirmations to Calgary.

As far as I can tell, we simply screwed up on this deal.  Diane Anderson, who 
was covering for Angie last week, was using my name to sign off on some other 
Canada deals which were approved from last week then signed and sent this one 
by mistake.  We're terribly sorry for the mistake.  Call me if you want to

hold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to 
provide excellent service to them.  While I can appreciate that Diane is out, 
that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the 
Calgary stuff.  Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand 
how mistakes continue to happen.  While I know that they can't appreciate the 
vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still 
need to be able to deliver top notch service.  Unfortunately, we stub our toe 
enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers 
pretty poor to average service.  That is a terrible internal PR issue.  Let's 
put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings 
with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their 
perceptions) and  can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because 
she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by  Rob 
Milnthorp (president of excelr Canada).  She responded to Rob quickly and 
handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with 
you at the time.  But now we need to look at all of our outstanding, 
potential or past issues with Calgary and get a solution in place.  She can 
fill you in on the details in that situation.

Director level are final.  You and your management team can begin the process 
of giving performance reviews to your employees.  I spoke with Sheila Walton 
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting 
the employee reviews.  She indicated that the target completion date should 
be the end of July.  

Promotions will be effective August 1st.  It is Dave Delainey's intent to 
announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24.  
This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.   I do not 
yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single 
memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.  I will keep you 
updated on this as I get direction from him.  

Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.  In 
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review 
process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when 
conducting their reviews.   It is very important for all of us to be 
consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups 
who will be giving performance reviews.  It is important to note, however, 
that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view 
of that employee's relative ranking.  In other words, an employee in the 
Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that 
the employee is doing a great job.   Clearly, a large number of employees 
performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory 
category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas 
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in 
the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc.  

Also please note the following: 

Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or 
Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given 
to the employees.  This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with 
the relative performance of that employee.  (This has been the stated process 
for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process 
as well.)
Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team, 
yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced 
members of your management team, or those management team members where you 
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and 
perhaps tough performance feedback.  I believe that we have spent some time 
in identifying these situations.  I ask your help to ensure that we follow 
through on this commitment.  

Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a

Sally,

As a follow up to your call yesterday, attached please find a powerpoint 
point presentation that outlines the business continuity options we are 
outlining and trying to get some cost estimates on.  For the more localized 
problems, we are working with the infrastructure group to develop a crisis 
management reporting structure so that accurate information is reported and 
the right personnel are notified and deployed.  The latter effort, however, 
does little to mitigate the larger risk.

Thanks,

Hi Sally and Mike,

Talked to Lexi Elliott and she told me about you all having lunch with
Blake, Clay and Michelle the other day. I know that meant alot to them and
only solidified their desire to work for excelr. Thanks for taking time out
of your busy schedules to meet with them.

Just wanted to let you know that I am scheduled to meet with Lexi and
Shelly Jones on Wednesday, August 2nd at 11:00 a.m. We will then be going to
lunch. Would like for both of you to join us if possible. I will bringing
Brenda Peters, who is with OU Career Services, down with me. She wanted to
come down with me and see excelr and meet both Lexi and Shelly, especially
Lexi, since she is the new OU contact for excelr. Brenda wants to make sure
everything is on schedule for this Fall recruiting. Lexi will be coming to
OU in early August to tour the campus and I will introduce her to Tim Rasnic
(JC Penney Leadership Program Director) and Dean Evans along with other
Department Heads in the Price College of Business. That way she should feel
comfortable when excelr comes to campus in October. If you are available and
would like to join us why don't you either let me know or else have your
assistants contact Lexi and let her know. If you would like to suggest a
time and place to meet, please feel free to do so.

If you can't make lunch and need to visit with me about anything, let me
know and I will arrange my schedule to meet with you. I will be in Houston
that entire week making my rounds.

Hope your summers have been going well and have been able to spend time with
your families.

Look forward to hopefully having lunch on August 2nd.

Take care.

Subject: SAP / Global/ Unify replication problem on Friday June 30th


On Friday June 30th, Unify's production performance was impacted by a large 
volume (30k) of replication/ configuration transactions from SAP.
The mass update from SAP to Global/ Unify effected excelr's business 
throughout the afternoon, causing contract replication to be delayed, and 
missed nominations.

Corrective actions taken to ensure this does not occur again:
Global Replication - Move the SAP to Global/ Unify replication for 
Intercompany from hourly to a nightly (1:00 am) process.  As we could miss 
new data setup dependencies, the volume is expected to be reduced.
SAP Support - SAP IT support will notify Global systems of any scheduled 
'rebuilds'/ mass updates to monitor/ move the schedule during an off-peak 
time.

provider can't be as responsive!  In a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is 
an eternity.  Sounds as if they are inflexible as well.  Our audience for 
this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away 
from the desk is not very workable either.  

After I get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, I may want to 
book them for September, although with a much smaller audience than would be 
desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery.

decision?  Thanks.  --Sally

Sally,
Angela Sprock forwarded your VM to me regarding the VAR training that you 
were looking to set up for your group.

I've taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them 
about the request and their availability. As well as discussing putting on 
the 2 day course solely for you group, I also discussed with them the 
possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter  modules. Although 
they considered this, they are insistent that the course structure, the 
activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format. 
They are a very busy company, in much demand both within excelr and other 
companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September 
21-22.

Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October 
onwards - but that may be less of a fit).

How does this fit with your group?
Let me know if you want to discuss this further

I am looking at Sunday, July 30th as possibly the best date -- probably 
starting about 5:00 in the afternoon.  How does that date work for you?  I 
assume that summer interns will still be with us then.  

What is your opinion on dates/friends to accompany you?  David will of course 
be there, and Mike McConnell and his wife will be there if the date works for 
them.  We can make this work either way.   Do you think that people would 
prefer to bring someone along, or simply attend solo.  I will take your

set-up, and clean up.  I know these things require a great deal of effort, 
especially when you welcome people to your personal residence.  I want to,

you have done for the University of Oklahoma and I am also aware of

to obtain the most from this experience.

very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.  His 
wife has MS in its most severe stages.  He was a manager previously, and we 
jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order 
to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.  He needs to be able 
to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a 
caregiver who is with his wife while he works.  I made a personnal commitment 
to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and 
predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will

ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same.

Sally 

This is great but you are right in that we probably do not have time to cross 
calibrate for the full global population of Risk Ops - perhaps next year. 
Also, from discussions with Fernley the higher grades will form part of Rick 
Causey's PRC ranking process - so we are left with lower risk post that ( 
Fernley said he would forward his note to Rick to yourself ).

My remaining concern is that any promotions, particularly in the risk group, 
which are not matched across Houston/London or indeed between EGM London and 
EEL London may create people risk. Can I suggest we compare promotions from 
senior specialist ( up to manager ) upwards ?

Hope everything is going well

Subject: Re: Cross calibration for Operations people globally  

I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be 
held in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be 
held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC 
meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary 
due to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed 
in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  

The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM 
and EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior 
Specialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review 
meetings mirror the ""preferred distribution"", which as you probably know 
suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should 
therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work 
has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not 
be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the 
managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good 
jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing 
suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I 
still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss 
my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of 
course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels 
that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my 
direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda 
Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to 
attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  

Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this 
year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the 
year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in 
Houston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would 
make sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.

Energy Operations.  

Analysts

Tara Piazze - potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams

Joseph Piotrowski - AA consulting background; would be a good fit for my

more  strength to this group

Charles Ames - currently works in back office for a brokerage firm; wants  to

books;  we  could immediately benefit from his background, while he learns 
excelr and how we manage risk; then he could add even more value in moving to 
a trading  role, if appropriate


Better Fits as Direct Hires (not analyst or associate, based on work 
experience and fit)

Mike Perun - VP of small bank; Ted brought him in with my group in mind; two 
of my directors interviewed him on Saturday; we'd like to consider him as a 
direct hire

Jason Sukenik- Undergrad and masters degrees in accounting, plus MBA; could 
be good fit as direct hire in as manager/director based on experience


Associates

Ryan Ngo - I believe that Kevin Presto suggested him for my group

Adele Pickens - She's on my list; need to research interviewers comments who 
suggested my group for an assignment for her (I don't think that anyone from  
Energy Operations interviewed him or her) 

Jennifer Bagwell - Apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not 
want to trade; would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk 
or operations

Dear Sally, 
I should have and I could have made a better job of trying to sell my idea at 
yesterday's meeting.   I'll be the first one to admit that all of my 
suggestions are not always the best alternative but,   I hope that you 
believe that I do have your best interests and excelr's best interests in mind 
every time that I make a suggestion.   
I hope to earn your trust as we continue to work together.
Sincerely, hgm

I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working 
with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help 
insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place 
in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as 
an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying 
the coal.  Therefore, the net excelr position will probably be carried in the 
London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to 
determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These 
books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd 
party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local 
curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and 
energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading 
activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process 
(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management 
administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting 
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general 
ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The 
following questions need to be addressed:  

  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be 
required?
      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for 
determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the 
      policy, if necessary.   
  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?
      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure 
required for the India office.    

Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and 
arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen 
complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your 
hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we 
demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain 
sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. 

Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date.

Subject: People to consider recruiting

As requested, I've created a list of people who:
have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to excelr.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to excelr.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at excelr.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the

ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of

for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent 
evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of 
the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working 
on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office 
processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of 
PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to 
manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 
this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will 
be approved. Since I've only been with excelr a short time and would like to 
continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith 
to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His 
number is 713 356 5617.

Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting 
and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving

Subject: People to consider recruiting

As requested, I've created a list of people who:
have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to excelr.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to excelr.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at excelr.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the 
audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).

Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best

I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working 
with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help 
insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place 
in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as 
an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying 
the coal.  Therefore, the net excelr position will probably be carried in the 
London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to 
determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These 
books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd 
party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local 
curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and 
energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading 
activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process 
(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management 
administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting 
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general 
ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The 
following questions need to be addressed:  

  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be 
required?
      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for 
determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the 
      policy, if necessary.   
  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?
      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure 
required for the India office.    

Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and 
arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen 
complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your 
hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we 
demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain 
sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. 

Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date.

we setup the Risk/Credit/Accnt/MIS/Internal Control function, I want to make

Someone from Arthur Andersen called Troy today asking to see the details of 
our DPR to G\L entry for March accounting.  I instructed him to tell them 
that we would be happy to set up a meeting for later next week to sit down 
with them and OA to discuss the process, the April numbers and the 
reconciliation of those numbers.  As I believe you all know, the entry that 
we had to book in March was close to $49 million and the April entry was 
closer to $25 million.  They know how the process works and should understand 
that the variances coming from the first several months are primarily timing, 
but experience tells me that they will over react if we simply turn over the 
analysis showing $49 as they have requested.  In light of the current 
reconciliation effort do you think we will be able to talk to them about the 
older items ( I would suggest only discussing things that fall into the 1999 
and prior category) late next week?

Subject: The Associate and Analyst program needs you!


The off-cycle department of the Associate and Analyst program needs your 
help!  

We are looking for volunteer interviewers for the following dates:

Thursday, December 7th from 9:00 a.m. -12:30 p.m.

Over 50 candidates will be interviewing this day.  The candidates will be a 
combination of Associates and Analysts representing schools such as Harvard, 
Princeton, SMU, MIT, University of Illinois, Emory and many others.  Each 
candidate will have 4 interviews.  Pending the outcome of their interviews we 
will invite them to stay and attend Super Saturday that weekend.  If for some 
reason we decide not to further pursue the candidate, we will fly them home 
that Friday morning.

In addition to the interviews on December 7th there will be a breakfast 
buffet from 7:45 a.m. to 8:45 a.m.  and a luncheon from 12:30 p.m. - 2:00 
p.m.  Interviewers are welcome to attend both the breakfast and the lunch on 
their interviewing date.  The interviewing, breakfast and lunch will take 
place at the Hyatt.  The interviews will be held in the Imperial Ballroom, 
and both breakfast and lunch will be held in the Regency Room.

We are asking excelr employees associate (associates who have been with the 
program for at least one year) level or higher  to volunteer at least ONE 
HOUR to interview candidates (this will be 2 interviews).  If you can 
volunteer for more than an hour or for more than just one of the stated 
dates, that would be great!  Your help is needed!  Please contact my 
assistant, Cathy Lira, at cathy.lira@excelr.com or x54049 as soon as possible, 
if you can volunteer any time for interviewing.  Please include the times 
that you can interview and whether or not you will be able to join us for

Dear Sally,

I'm looking forward to start working on the 22nd.  I've arranged to have the
first day orientation as well as PC training on this date, which will last
until about 4:30.

I'm putting together some thoughts on how to best ""kick off"" my roles and
responsibilities and was wondering if you would be able to meet at 4:30 on
the 22nd to go over this.

I'm available through tomorrow at 713 356 4086 and the rest of the week at
713 628 7570.

Best regards,

Shona

Sally says Todd's London project is under Barry Pearce (related to 
Continental Power) - Barry would need to designate London RC (or James New in 
his absence, since Barry is in Houston).

Regarding the ""extra"" housing costs, this would need to be charged to Todd's 
RC in Houston, which is #2182.

Please let me know if you require additional information.

Which RC in London is taking most of Todd's costs? I have some urgent bills

Subject: Re: Move  

Mark,

It's good to hear from you. Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I 
didn't realize you were not aware of the situation. 

Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap 
a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up 
through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in 
London on May 8th.

Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat 
an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he 
had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more 
week, to May 15th.

Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 11, but apparently his 
plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend 
since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now 
wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.

Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S. 
the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize 
my plans around his leaving on May 11, and he relocate to a hotel if he 
needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out 
with him instead of returning early.

Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out  date to him, I guess we work 
around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 22 
as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may 
continue to drag on day-by-day.

Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and 
Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how 
strict ""two full working days"" is, we may actually need for him to be out no 
later than Wednesday, May 17--or even Wednesday, May 10.)

Cheers,
Tom x33926

Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him 
in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain 
a mention of the transition:

Example:

 Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.  He will be 
transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce 
assumes his responsibilities for EBS.  The current trading staff for EBS will 
report to Barry effective with his start date in May.  

I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out

Hi Sally
Hope you had a great Easter!
Are you okay with us leaving the office early on Wed May 3rd?
Sometimes it is hard for some to break for lunch and others can't do a dinner 
after work.  I thought mtg at 3pm would be inbetween.  And give everyone a 
chance to relax without thinking about coming back to work.
I wanted to check with you before I asked for RSVP's.

Hi Ladies,
If you don't know already, Patti Thompson (Sally's Assistant) is now an 
official excelr Employee!!!!  Yeah!!!!!  I couldn't be more pleased and would 
like to arrange a get together to welcome her to our group!  Plus, we haven't 
all gotten together for awhile!  Instead of having lunch or dinner, maybe we 
can meet in between.

 How about this? 
Little Papasito's (on Westhiemer and Kirby) or Tilah's (on West Dallas)
Wednesday, May 3rd
Meet at the restaurant at 3:00pm
There is one thing about this. . . .no returning to the office!
(It hasn't been decided whether to go to Papasito's or Tilah's, place your 
vote!)

I  would love to accommodate as many assistants as possible.  So if this 
conflicts with many of your schedules, we can be flexible on the date.
Please let me know what you think as soon as you can.  I'll keep everyone 
posted!

24255,beck-s/_sent_mail/500.,<15130126.1075855924029.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Charlene:  Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our 
meeting on Wednesday morning.  I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so 
it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.  

Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became 
concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other 
supporters of the program.   Many of those expressing frustration are heavily 
involved in the recruiting process.   It is their commitment to both 
recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting 
talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program. 

I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would 
bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss 
them with you in a constructive manner.  Our intent is continued support and 
improvement of the program.   The meeting took place on March 28 and included 
the following:

 Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU

 Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT  

 Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida

 Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of 
Florida

 Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU

 Carolyn Barrett  EBS    

 Howard Selzer  excelr Global E&P 


Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:

One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an 
announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.  Not much 
materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be 
managed.  In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw 
that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and 
differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.  We 
feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program 
on campus. 

SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is 
impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an 
innovative company.  The July start date does not consider December graduates 
and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in 
May.  

Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed 
senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or 
communication about the program.   We hear rumors of ""tracks"", but no facts 
or details.  Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some 
had not.  

Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support 
staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily 
focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.

Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many 
of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join 
with you in some of your plans for the program.   We are concerned that 
decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum 
without what could be some valuable input from some of us.  

MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team 
and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on 
campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top 
candidates and the pride of participants in the program.  We feel that the 
focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and 
we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.

Sally,

I wanted to give you a quick update.

I met with Fernley last Friday and we had a good discussion.  He wanted to 
know my initial assessment of the project and a rough time-line.  I admire 
the fact that he took almost 30 minutes of his time to show his interest in 
this project and myself.  I told him that it would be prudent for me to 
return a month after implementation of the book splits.  This way I can 
ensure that the processes and tools are in place and used by both the traders 
and the support staff.  If Brent needs some assistance at that time, I could 
stay for a 2-week span and meet two needs on one trip.

I spoke to Mark Tawney today and he welcomes my support on the weather desk.  
When I asked Mark about the impact of the traders leaving, he said that they 
are probably trading even more.  Tim Norton is meeting with Mark today and 
assuming things go well, he could began training almost immediately.

I'll try to call you tomorrow,
Todd

Hi Elyse - I just spoke with Ramesh Rao (associate dean).  He has not yet
made the Excellence Fund awards, which are also part of the excelr endowment.
He would like to have the dinner in the fall, when all of the awardees have
been chosen.  He felt that a dinner the end of April would conflict with a
major E-commerce conference we're having here, and the excelr awards would
get the attention they deserve in the fall.  The other advantage of a fall
dinner is that the new students will be here, and if we have a big
announcement then, they can see what they have to look forward to.  Will
this work for you?  Thanks.  Sue

know that you are confirming the 3 winners and will get me their info once
they have been chosen.  If you don't mind seeing who from the university is

another evening that week or rescheduling for the fall after classes begin.

Thanks, Sally, for the update.  The only day that Rick is available is 
Monday, April 24 - this definitely limits us! I've asked Sharron to find out 
if others can't make it on the 24th (the recipients, Dean May, interviewers), 
would he rather have it on another day that week without him or have it in 
the fall once school starts again. Sharron will let me know what Rick says 
today.  Then, I'll call Sue White to start getting the ball rolling with

for the 24th.

Do you want me to notify the winners?  I'm happy to do so.

We interviewed the 12 finalists in Austin yesterday.   Interviewers were Gene 
Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.  The four of us met this 
morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.  Based 
on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today 
with the names of the three suggested award winners.  I conveyed this via 
voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.  She had told me that her schedule 
would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow 
morning.  She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.  I would not 
anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue.  
However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients 
until after that conversation.  She will most likely then contact you to 
confirm their names.  I have phone numbers, addresses and e:mail addresses 
for all three, and I will provide you with those as soon as the official 
notification from the University takes place.  

Gene, Thomas and Roger are all interested in attending the dinner in Austin 
if schedules permit.  The week of April 24th is a good one for me for the 
dinner.  Obviously, many schedules have to be coordinated.  I know that Rick 
Causey will want to attend (he will have been in London the week prior, so he 
may be available).  I have also talked with CIndy Olson and I know that she 
would like to be included if her schedule permits.  

Today was Brent's last day in the Houston office for several months.  Let me 
know how I can help with these arrangements.

Sue:  Greetings!  We have not spoken in awhile, but I wanted to touch base 
with you regarding the MBA Excellence Awards and specifically hosting a 
dinner similar to last year's event at Jeffrey's.  I am expecting a baby in 
two weeks, so I'd like to get as much of this planned now as possible!  Amy 
Lee, Charla Stuart and Ali Saler who work in my group will pick up any of the 
pieces that I don't get to prior to becoming a mom, and one of them will 
attend the dinner in Austin.

I have a number of questions:  First, have the award winners been chosen?

Subject: Junior Achievement & excelr

Cliff Baxter is representing excelr on the Board of Junior Achievement.  One 
of the programs that he would like to continue at excelr is the Job Shadow 
program.  This program entails a half-day commitment once per month beginning 
with the fall school semester.  The high school students are first given an 
overview of excelr and then a tour of the building.  The students then spend 
approximately 1-1/2 hours directly with individuals within specific 
departments.  Cliff would like to have as many departments as possible 
participate since this may be the only exposure these students have to the 
business world.

Please advise if you are willing to have your department participate, who 
your contact person is, and how many students that you would like to host 
each time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.  The four of us met this 
morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.  Based 
on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today 
with the names of the three suggested award winners.  I conveyed this via 
voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.  She had told me that her schedule 
would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow 
morning.  She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.  I would not 
anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue.  
However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients 
until after that conversation.  She will most likely then contact you to 
confirm their names.  I have phone numbers, addresses and e:mail addresses 
for all three, and I will provide you with those as soon as the official 
notification from the University takes place.  

Gene, Thomas and Roger are all interested in attending the dinner in Austin 
if schedules permit.  The week of April 24th is a good one for me for the 
dinner.  Obviously, many schedules have to be coordinated.  I know that Rick 
Causey will want to attend (he will have been in London the week prior, so he 
may be available).  I have also talked with CIndy Olson and I know that she 
would like to be included if her schedule permits.

held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC 
meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary

meetings mirror the ""preferred distribution"", which as you probably know 
suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should 
therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work 
has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not 
be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the 
managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good 
jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing 
suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I 
still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss 
my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of 
course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels 
that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my 
direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda 
Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to 
attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  

Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this 
year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the 
year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in 
Houston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would

I have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about 
checking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) 
which raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross 
calibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?

Sally,

If you don't mind, I'd like to leave early today (2 or 3 pm) to pick up Scott 
(my son) at the airport.  He went to Denver to visit his sister for spring 
break & was scheduled to come back Monday evening.  Unfortunately, due to 
winter storm, all flights were cancelled Monday & most of Tuesday.  I wasn't 
able to get him a flight back until this morning.  Scott, however, was not 
too disappointed in missing 3 days of school (instead of 1 that we planned).  
Anyway, if it's okay with you, I will let your direct reports know that Irena 
will have numbers where they can reach you.

Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore.  This draft 
now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he 
made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week, 
meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday.  You and John should receive 
those drafts today.  

2)  I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply 
to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was 
asking).  I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am 
there.    

3)  To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are 
the following:

Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide 
for you during this transition period
Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of 
the details on having support personnel in London 

Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for 
Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one 
(which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston)

Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is 
appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective 
trading operations and controls world-wide

I look forward to seeing you next week.  ",Non Abusive

morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in 
regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick 
Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will 
provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during 
the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has 
hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the 
details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will 
also map out an excelr trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, 
which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a 
strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with 
Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael 
in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as 
possible.  

Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his  
business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we 
would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good 
ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all excelr 
locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were 
focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on 
leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading 
operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be 
generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  

I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as 
she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but 
I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.  
It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in 
Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading 
operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.  
I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and 
offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role 
over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as 
needed.  

I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to 
discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your 
business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  

This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are 
conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have 
taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be 
a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.  
The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of 
North American locations and some entities in the US in which excelr has a 
large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort 
in London will occur in mid April.  

Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to 
Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those 
drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business 
managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley 
suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final 
copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and 
Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip 
in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned 
the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I 
can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was 
pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was 
out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney 
and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to 
accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They

I have two options available below. I have not seen these apartments, 
however, so would recommend that you both have a look when you arrive next 
week. Please let me know if you find these suitable. Neither of them are 
located in South Kensington or Chelsea but I think you will find that 
Kensington and Marylebone are also very nice, close to parks and high 
streets, etc.   Also, is Fernley the person from whom I should seek approval 
for costs of accommodation and per diems or is Houston picking up these 
charges?

Kensington High Street - We have a block of apartments here that offer
accommodation of a high standard. They will have a newly  refubished
spacious flat free with 3 bathrooms, 24 hour porterage, Mon-Fri maid
service, and an underground car parking space included.

Please however note that this flat will not be free until the 03rd or 04th
of April.

OR

Baker Street W1 - Spacious 3 bedroom flat in porteraged block close to the
station. This flat has been newly decorated and re-carpeted throughout. One
double bedroom with bathroom ensuite and 2 bedrooms with 2 single beds in
each. Fully equipped kitchen and comfortable lounge.

business trip on which we are allowing him to bring his family.  ENA is 
picking up the cost associated with the family.  Sounds as if I need to make 
sure we moderate expectations on those accomodations, but we will get that 
handled. 

That is great that Edith will be in London for part of Todd's stay.  

Your notes ask for Astros tickets for Wed., April 10th.  Monday is actually 
the 10th; Wednesday is the 12th.  The Astros play St. Louis on both of those 
days., both evening games.  I would be happy to give you four tickets for 
either one of those games.  Just let me know whether you actually want the 
10th or the 12th.  

We will definitely plan to get together while you are here in April.  I would 
love to see Jo as well.  We will have to work the details.  I am planning to 
be in London next week, arriving the morning of the 20th (Monday) and staying

To recap.

1. I think Todd is going to be here on 25th March. HR eare sorting out 
accomodation for one month. Europe pay his costs, NA pick up family costs.

2. Spoke to Bernie A - Edith is going to be here for a week in the middle of 
Todd's month.

3. I'll be in Houston w/c 8th April - lets get together then for an update. 
Though I believe you may be here sooner than that?

4. Astros' - any chance of tickets for Wed 10th (v St Louis). I guess - to be 
extra cheeky - can I have 4 - to take Jo and kids? No problem if that's not 
possible.

Talk soon.

bank, and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent.  When I asked if 
he knew of any other talented people at Fleming (his current employer) that 
we should know, he immediately suggested Tana.  His read is that she is very 
bright, creative, and innovative.  She has worked on many special projects at 
Fleming, but James believes that she would certainly consider a generalist 
role as she learned excelr and would then ""earn"" her way into managing special 
projects.  I thought that I would give ENA a first look at this candidate.

If they are still employed (presuming all but Ilkka are still on the payroll) 
then I believe this should be requested.  As a matter of principal it should 
have been done for all in the first place and there should be no reason why 
it could not be done now.  Admittedly the reasons will now be obvious for the 
request, we can simply tell those checked that it was overlooked originally.  
Relative to Ilkka, there is no harm in requesting it as well.  Presuming he 
won't consent then we can discuss further.

Subject: Background Checks

I have made contact with the security folks in Houston and been advised of 
what we need to do.  One obvious point is to understand the legal aspects of 
such a check.  I have now spoken to a Finnish lawyer who has advised that any 
employee background check (to include credit checks and bank checks) must 
have the prior written approval of the employee concerned and this would need 
to be provided to the source of the information before it is handed over.

I assume we need to re-think whether we want to go down this route given that 
this check process will now have a very visible profile in the Helsinki 
office.

What are your views?

Greetings.

Attached is the Argentine gas process flow, which has been under review for 
the past month or so by Mike Guerriero, his staff in BA and my group in 
Houston.   The Southern Cone trading support is based off of this model, so 
it also applies to power in BA and SP.   I do have process flows for power in 
both places, but I would like to revisit them prior to distribution.   If you 
would like them regardless, just let me know and I will pass them along asap.

I hope you have a successful trip.   Please let me know how I can be of

I share your pain about increased deal flow.  Have you spoken with Lavo about

Is the Entelligence database used by anybody?  Should we not focus those 
resources on GCP?

I am getting hammered on the exposure questions.

Subject: Re: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty  

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

Subject: Houston Analyst North America Presentation

Sally, Attached are two draft slides that we wish to include in the analyst 
presentation. I am hoping that you will be able to coordinate the extraction 
of the data necessary to complete the slides.

The slides are basically maps of our power and gas operations but surrounded 
with some hard data on particular aspects of the business to demonstrate our 
scope and size. I would suggest that the maps are printed out and you will 
then easily see the data we require and the format we wish to use to present 
it. However , in summary the information needed is:

GAS
Storage Capability, Leased and Owned
Number of Counterparties - 1997, 1998, 1999
Contract type by customer in  %  - I have segregated by Industrials, LDCs, 
and Other, but I am open for  better suggestions
Transport contracts - bcf/d - firm and Interruptible, 
Term of contracts  - I suggested ,<1 year,< 10years, >10years  but again am 
open for more appropriate terms
Peak daily deliveries - Btue/d - 1997, 1998, 1999

POWER
Contract type by customer in  %  - I have segregated by Marketers, Utilities 
and Other, but I am open for  better suggestions
Term of contracts  - I suggested ,<1 year,< 10years, >10years  but again am 
open for more appropriate terms
Number of counterparties -1996,1997, 1998, 1999

If there is data that you or your team believe is more appropriate to 
demonstrate our activities in these markets please let me know. I will be 
very grateful for such additional material and information . 

As always our timeline is tight and would therefore appreciate the data by 
close of business Friday.   
Let me know how this works

""A new web based trading service drew significant levels of interest......One 
trader says he did ""50 or 60 deals on excelrOnline.  ""There's nothing 
fundamentally better about the form of trading"", he says, ""but they're always

your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at excelr.  

As a company, excelr has spent much time and effort to ensure that business

working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan 
for January 1.    Your  work on the first  will be the final step in this 
process.  Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the 
office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as 
usual.  

I wish each one of you a happy new year.  I continually feel privileged to 
work with this dedicated and talented group of  employees.  I look forward to 
all that we will accomplish in 2000.

Subject: Various Discussion Points

I will commit to writing the three items that I had hoped to discuss with you 
today.  Feel free to get back with me via voice mail (x35926).  If you would 
prefer to discuss any of these with me, you can reach me at home from 
December 20-23 while I am on vacation.  My home number is 281-370-8568.  I 
will be back at work for the week between Christmas and New Years. 

1)  January 1:  Do you want me to call you that day after we have tested all 
systems to give you a status update?  I can leave a voice mail for you at 
your excelr number.  Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you 
will provide me with a number where you will be.  Cliff Baxter and several 
key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed 
our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we 
trade in North America.  I will make these phone calls myself, and will 
naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential.  
Please let me know your preference for notification.  

2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft 
memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.  This memo describes a coordination 
role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that 
should be coordinated in all trading locations.  Please let me and/or Rick 
know if you have any comments or suggestions.  I had hoped to briefly discuss 
this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1) 
This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the 
needs of ENA.  I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control 
and service in ENA operations.  Through that hard work, I believe that I have 
your confidence in my ability to deliver results.  I  would do nothing to 
jeopardize that.  (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and 
some one will play that role.  If I play that role, I can be in the best 
position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.    



3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but 
I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants 
logistics to report to him.  His stated reason to me is that he wants it to 
""look like power"".  I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what  
the criteria should be on which we make that decision.  I will propose to 
Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the 
regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable 
information about the pipes and capacity.  ( We have that now for the Central 
and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is 
built out for gas.)  I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report 
to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and 
West regions.  Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk, 
confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very 
closely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that 
the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of 
volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction 
in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.  Without a continuing focus in 
logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our 
ability to deliver our projected cost savings.  I also believe that Brent 
will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances.  
While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an 
earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that 
either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong 
front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding 
logistics accountable for their part in this.  

I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on 
this issue.

24418,beck-s/_sent_mail/648.,<1525076.1075855927506.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"We are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all 
commodities front to back.  We found a few minor issues, primarily reports 
with report dates that were incorrect.  The content and underlying 
calculations in the reports were correct.  These were really just query and 
formatting issues.  All were quick fixes of five minutes or less.  So at this 
point we feel confident about our system situation.  More will unfold with 
counterparties next week, but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have 
we.

interfaces.   My feeling is that there should be at least one person from the 
Settlements area and one person from Georgeanne Hodges' accounting group 
involved in the signoff.

To date we have been working very closely with Melissa White and Regan Smith 
from the technical side.  Additionally, there have been design workshops 
which have been attended by Lisa  Csikos and Evelyn Aucoin.  

Who would you like to be involved in this process??

If you could please let me know or let me know if you would like to sit down 
and talk about it.

Please find attached the intercompany imbalance analysis for excelr Corp. an=

Please note that intercompany imbalances are extremely significant this=20

imbalances are expected to be resolved with November close and the remainin=

Subject: Credit Policy with AEGIS



Jim, we are pleased to advise that AEGIS is putting the final touches on the
wording and we hope to have it to you shortly.  In working with them, we
made note of the obligations of both excelr and AEGIS as respects
documentation to support the contract.  In particular, AEGIS is obligated
pursuant to VIII. (c) to provide an accounting of the EAB from the date they
received the premium to the date six months after the policy incepted.
Thereafter, the accounting will be due every six months.  We have requested
this from AEGIS and will provide a statement to you when it is received.

excelr on the other hand is required to provide the following:

Page 4 of 13: IV. Definitions(i) Documents:

     Prior to each anniversary, INSURED
agrees to
     notify COMPANY of any material
change in the
     form of the agreements (ISDA,
Enfolio Master
     Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement, Master
Energy
     Purchase and Sale Agreement and
others which
     govern INSURED TRANSACTIONS).  The
     report shall consist of summary of
changes and
     red lined version of documents.

Page 7 of 13: VI. Conditions to Payment by the COMPANY(e)
     Evaluation of Creditworthiness by
INSURED:

     The INSURED hereby agrees to
promptly notify
     the COMPANY in writing of any
material changes
     in the process and procedures set
forth in the
     document titled XXXXXX (Credit
Procedures).

Page 7 of 13: VI. Conditions to Payment by the COMPANY (g)
     Report of Overdue Items:

     The INSURED shall remit a report to
the COMPANY
     no later than 45 days subsequent to
the end of each
     calendar month, a listing of all
past due amounts in
     excess of 60 days past due as of
that month-end
     date, which may be subject to
coverage hereunder.

Page 7 of 13: VII.  Settlement of Payments Due by the COMPANY
     or the INSURED (a):

     The INSURED shall provide to the
COMPANY within
     thirty (30) days after the end of
each half-year
     period a bordereau.....

Page 7 of 13: VII. Settlement of Payments Due by
     the COMPANY or the INSURED (c):

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
INSURED must
     notify the COMPANY in writing within
thirty (30)
     days after the INSURED first has
knowledge of
     any loss actually or potentially
subject to coverage
     under this policy....

There was some correspondence in October regarding the report of overdue
items (VI.(g)) and the bordereau (VII.(a)), both on page 7 of 13, however I
don't think that these reports have been generated.  We would appreciate
your assistance in obtaining these in order to provide them to AEGIS.
Additionally, we are obligated to provide underwriters with the revised
Credit Procedures and would appreciate an update on that process also.

Thank you for your assistance on these items.  Please let us know if you
have any questions or assist you in compiling these reports.

Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

excelr WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming excelr Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
excelr=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

excelr Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include excelr=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) excelr Global Assets.  In addition, excelr=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of excelr Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of excelr Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of excelr APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of excelr Global Assets. excelr Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of excelr=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of excelr APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of excelr India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
excelr=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into excelr Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of excelr Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of excelr Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

excelr Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of excelr Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

excelr Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to excelr Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating excelr=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, excelr Americas.  excelr Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for excelr=20
Americas.

excelr Europe
The excelr Europe organization, which includes excelr=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and excelr Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

excelr Global Markets
excelr Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for excelr=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
excelr Global Assets.  excelr Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

excelr Industrial Markets
excelr Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of excelr Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=

excelr Net Works, and excelr Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=

today.  Feel free to get back with me via voice mail (x35926).  If you would 
prefer to discuss any of these with me, you can reach me at home from 
December 20-23 while I am on vacation.  My home number is 281-370-8568.  I 
will be back at work for the week between Christmas and New Years. 

1)  January 1:  Do you want me to call you that day after we have tested all 
systems to give you a status update?  I can leave a voice mail for you at 
your excelr number.  Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you 
will provide me with a number where you will be.  Cliff Baxter and several 
key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed 
our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we 
trade in North America.  I will make these phone calls myself, and will 
naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential.  
Please let me know your preference for notification.  

2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft 
memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.  This memo describes a coordination 
role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that 
should be coordinated in all trading locations.  Please let me and/or Rick 
know if you have any comments or suggestions.  I had hoped to briefly discuss 
this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1) 
This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the 
needs of ENA.  I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control 
and service in ENA operations.  Through that hard work, I believe that I have 
your confidence in my ability to deliver results.  I  would do nothing to 
jeopardize that.  (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and 
some one will play that role.  If I play that role, I can be in the best 
position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.    



3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but 
I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants 
logistics to report to him.  His stated reason to me is that he wants it to 
""look like power"".  I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what  
the criteria should be on which we make that decision.  I will propose to 
Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the 
regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable 
information about the pipes and capacity.  ( We have that now for the Central 
and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is 
built out for gas.)  I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report 
to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and 
West regions.  Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk, 
confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very 
closely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that 
the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of 
volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction 
in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.  Without a continuing focus in 
logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our 
ability to deliver our projected cost savings.  I also believe that Brent 
will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances.  
While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an 
earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that 
either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong 
front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding 
logistics accountable for their part in this.  

I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on 
this issue.   ",Non Abusive
24435,beck-s/_sent_mail/663.,<17669304.1075855927962.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"We are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 30th 
floor.  Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to 
densify the floor during the next several months while excelr Property 
Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32.   In the mean 
time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the 
capacity on the floor.  While these locations are not prime spots, people 
will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow.  Once the window 
seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign 
groups on the floor and people will need to move once again.

I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while 
she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations 
personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors.  Susan Harrison is 
working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition 
period.  Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and 
equipment on the 30th floor.  If there are any problems once a move has 
occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment, 
printers, etc.), please contact Chantelle at Ext. 3-6279 as she will also 
coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items.  If Chantelle is not 
available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup.  Maria can be reached at Ext. 
3-5586.

I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the 
window spaces.  We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and 
supplies on the floor.  Please coordinate with your assistant to have your 
area cleaned up by December 31.  During this clean-up process, if you have 
any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn 
Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext. 3-5237 and she 
will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a 
neat and professional work environment.  Between now and the summer of 2001 
when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are 
all working in a temporary and makeshift environment.  I would greatly 
appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available 
space effectively.

If I have missed anyone on the distribution list that has just recently moved 
to the 3oth floor, please forward this message to them.

Subject: Sheri Thomas

Sally,

I have not worked directly with Sheri Thomas until last week.  I work with 
members of her group and we have successfully managed to take care of 
trader's wishes for more flexibility related to logging in one time and 
having the trades mapped to the appropriate system depending on commodity 
traded.  The process is still taken care of through 'back-screen' programming 
and in my opinion should be easier to apply to all traders with 
cross-commodity portfolios.  The only one on one contact I have had with 
Sheri was to request that Power Risk be involved in the approval process when 
a trader was requesting an EOL login id.  There have been instances when 
traders will get set up on EOL but have not been set up in Enpower.  When 
this happens their transaction will not bridge because there is no place for 
them to go as Enpower has no way of recognizing them as a trader.  Sheri 
talked to one of her group members and had them include myself and my leads 
(for back-up) into the approval process of EOL trader setup.

She was understanding and responsive to my request.  I do not feel that I 
have had the appropriate exposure to her work to give her a formal rating, 
but I wanted to share the minimal experience I have had for your reviewal 
process.

So far, we have not done any further testing on ConfirmLogic since early last 
week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays.  
Kathryn called me late on Friday and said that they would let us know when we 
can resume testing.  We have not heard from them this morning.

Their demo last Thursday for the Beta Clients went well.  The customers that 
participated in the demo were Reliant, Dynegy, Calpine, and Sempra (Sempra 
participated via Video Conference from excelr's New York Office.)  Dynegy 
immediately said that they were very interested and I heard that Reliant 
called back and expressed their interest as well.

I will keep you posted on any further developments.

Associate PRC and attending the Las Vegas Offsite on the 13th... If year end 
PRC is anything like mid-year we can probably assume we will be out of their 
after 6:00 and we may have a tough time catching a flight into vegas that 
night.  I am checking on alternative travel plans and flight schedules for 
myself and will also keep you informed as to the what our options will be.  

If you don't need this info or there are any questions let me know, otherwise 
I will assume we are all in the same boat, and need to get to Vegas in the 
evening of the 13th..... either on commercial aircraft or co. jet.

Car Rental Options for excelr Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage excelr's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for excelr travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from excelr's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for excelr 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of excelr 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the excelr Travel Program intranet @ gss.excelr.com <http://gss.excelr.com/>.

Subject: Management Team Changes

Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from excelr.  It is with 
regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has 
contributed greatly during her tenure at excelr, particularly in the 
development of global information that has been critical in supporting our 
effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate 
Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in 
wishing Mary well.  

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within excelr Net Works of 
the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy 
Zipper, who leads excelrOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its 
early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to excelrOnline a 
smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges 
necessary between excelrOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team 
has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  
operations of excelrOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have 
Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger excelrOnline team.  Sheri's 
team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as 
Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the 
experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  
Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this 
organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the 
Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see 
that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any 
changes in excelr's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations 
are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri 
and her team.

Subject: Update on ConfirmLogic

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we 
discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we 
had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta 
Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle 
Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for 
Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today 
during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems

Subject: Update on ConfirmLogic

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we 
discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we 
had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta 
Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle 
Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for 
Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today 
during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems 
with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I 
talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said 
that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We 
plan more testing in the morning.

effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate 
Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within excelr Net Works of 
the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy 
Zipper, who leads excelrOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its 
early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to excelrOnline a 
smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges 
necessary between excelrOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team 
has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  
operations of excelrOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have 
Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger excelrOnline team.  Sheri's 
team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as 
Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the 
experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  
Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this 
organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the 
Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see 
that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any 
changes in excelr's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations 
are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri

Subject: Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 
employees in the excelr building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of 
the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule 
one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this 
segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees 
per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of 
operations employees):  

  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, 
settlements and EIM risk 

  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various 
products) 

  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., 
settlements and DPR           and MPR teams
  
  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), 
operational analysis

     
  37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global 
services       
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative ""newcomer"" to excelr 
Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would 
be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it 
easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

Subject: Re: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty  

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue

this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are 
checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch 
both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all 
origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a 
date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do 
one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

two) where you would like the meetings and I will call Patti to coordinate

Subject: Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 
employees in the excelr building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of 
the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule 
one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this 
segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees 
per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of 
operations employees):  

  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, 
settlements and EIM risk 

  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various 
products) 

  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., 
settlements and DPR           and MPR teams
  
  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), 
operational analysis

     
  37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global 
services       
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative ""newcomer"" to excelr 
Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would 
be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it 
easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

nursing homes, provide ""coaching"" during practices for Special Olympics 
volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with 
children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.  It 
is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a

on themselves.  The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will 
remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.

Subject: Disaster Recovery / Business Resumption for Commodity Logic

One of the calculated risks ENA has lived with is the potential 
unavailability of systems given a disaster strikes the Houston area such as a 
hurricane that knocks out power, etc.

Have you given any thought on the commodity logic side of providing a 
hot-backup / fail-over capability from another location ?  This could be 
particularly critical with the Contract Exchange module and might be one 
assurance customers would want before signing up.

For that matter, is there a market in providing disaster recovery / 
hot-backup capability to companies in high-risk areas?  It has traditionally

meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 to discuss and revise.  I don't want to ""mass 
mail"" this on Friday.  (None of these guys will read it on Friday afternoon 
or over the weekend anyway.)  Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vickers and 
Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and power 
covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation in 
person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).  They will likely 
come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presentation 
could be tweaked.  With revisions from this session, then it makes sense to 
set up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the word to 
the whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).  We can start 
those next week and finish most next week.  I think that the logistics of any 
offsite would be difficult with schedules and I don't really think that we 
need one.    

Calgary will need a special message, and we may have to go to Calgary to 
deliver it.  You and I can discuss that in more detail.   Max will be in from 
Mexico on April 20, and Beth Apollo has already booked some time with him on 
that day for us to cover this information.  Laura Luce is here today and will 
be back in Houston next Wednesday, April 11.  I have booked time with her 
that afternoon to cover the presentation.  That will leave Portland as the 
other ""out of towner"" to schedule.  I am planning a trip there the next time 
that Stacey White heads up there.  Right now we are looking at April 17, 18 
or 19.  We can send Chris info before that and plan to meet with him perhaps 
in conjunction with that trip that I need to make around our west power risk 
team.  I would  welcome your participation in any of the meetings here in 
Houston or on the trips that we will need to make.  You and I can discuss the 
appropriate make-up of the team for each of these presentations at lunch 
tomorrow.  

I think that this plan will be effective and will give us the best coverage 
and input.  Are you comfortable with this plan of attack?  --Sally

Why don't you and Rahil agree on the draft ASAP and then let Rahil send it 
out in draft form this Friday afternoon to all these individuals for their 
review and comments.  Rahil can work with these people directly next week on 
their comments.  Rahil is free from the day-to-day operations issues and has 
the time to push the product menu to the EA Originators.

We can still set up an offsite to finalize, but we need to get something out 
because these individuals are already out selling as we speak.

But I assume the invitation will be extended to all of their groups so that 
whoever they want can attend. 

I would actually prefer that the presentation is actually circulated to the 
groups on Friday rather than presented as we will wait forever on getting an 
offsite together.  How about circulating the presentation and then letting 
them refer all questions to Rahil - see how much interest you get.  One on 
ones are much better and I think this is how Rahil should proceed.  We need 
to get in front of customers in the next couple of weeks.

Let's aim to get a least three customers this quarter.

Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, 
the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue 
sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the 
DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by 
this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are 
checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch 
both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all 
origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a 
date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do 
one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas   Frank Vickers (East)
   Laura Luce (Central)
   Barry Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives  Fred LaGrasta

Power  Dave Duran
   Ozzie Pagan
   Ed Baughman

Calgary  Ladain

Mexico  Max Y.

Sally,
It is on the list as a medium priority and we can discuss more on Monday.

I would not say that the system is totally done.  It is in User testing  -- 
Chris and crew are testing it and I will be getting a demo in the next week 
or two.  It has not been rolled out to the user community.  

I am also going to challenge them to think about whether there are any more 
quick ""cosmetic"" things that we could do with out much more time or cost.

Do you want to have a look before it rolls out?

Also  I thought maybe giving a preview to Louise would be good since she 
looks at the report pretty regularly, and is a big fan of automation.

Richard really, really loves pecan pie--I may try and make it and bring it

Really--a pound of coffee would make him very happy for his birthday...

Thanks for the suggestions for Richard.  Let me know if you think of other
ideas - I need b'day and Christmas ideas.

Probably the easiest thing to bring for Thanksgiving could be a dessert --
or something else that is a favorite of your family.  I know that it is
really kind of hard to travel with food -- particularly since you will
probably be working on Wednesday morning.  I have made Thanksgiving dinner
for so many years (one of the few times that I really like to cook), that I
will be glad to cover it.  Your company will be the very best thing that
you can bring.  We are looking forward to having you all here.  (The
sleeper sofa for the media room will arrive this Friday!)

Hi...

Still trying to think of things for Richard.  Electric can opener,
Guatemalan Antigua coffee, new shirt for racquetball--he says XXL--hard to
find but most chain sporting good stores have that size--probably white or
something very basic with a collar.  He really does need this--his
racquetball duds are looking pretty bad...

We are looking forward to Thanksgiving--can't believe it is next week!
What
can we bring?

are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our

Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect 
that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost 
centers.  By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out 
where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as

Sally,
One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the 
rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT 
for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy 
since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so 
there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, 
however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for 
an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to 
be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to 
put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know 
in a few days I would appreciate it.

Subject: Merchanting Metals Update #2

The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( 
see attached email ) was to provide  
a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage, spread and brand 
and location
a timely substantiation of 
stock on balance sheet
forward MTM 
debtors and creditor balances
OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany 
account

Despite the best efforts of IT, continuing problems with the AS400 
application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock 
reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright 
stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering 
sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - 
which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and 
forward positions to full accounting values.

Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the 
following :

I will discuss with AA the following
that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to 
data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model 
simplifications)
that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, 
AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these 
differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA 
within the audit timetable)
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my 
earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards 
) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to 
meet the above stated objectives
The signoff for additional permanent 'excelr' headcount who will 'duplicate' 
certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing 
Traffic staff
A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the 
final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400. We will continue to 
investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or 
system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe. However, 
this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and 
signoff of system p&l values with traders.
The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( 
reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and 
repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.

Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full 
reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination
an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing 
planned 23 rd review due to system issues ), requiring
full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 th
sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to 
Barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually 
created position analysis
the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our 
cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 
23 rd

I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

Regards

Mike

Subject: Merchanting Metals update

Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating 
risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility 
(""OBSF"") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility 
late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, 
arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the 
operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result 
of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on 
gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting 
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain 
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as 
to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and 
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage 
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting 
developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as 
to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process 
tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all 
Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 
covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand 
and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within 
the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical 
VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been 
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of 
Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements 
for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control 
staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit 
timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source 
documentation within excelr
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party 
inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will 
not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward 
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report 
signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( 
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) 
and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where 
applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or 
external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during 
April 

If you have any questions please call me on x34703

the summer interns was favorable.  Their key comment, though, was that it 
would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer so 
that the interns could have networked with other excelr UT alums throughout 
the summer.  Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summer?  
It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.  I will 
be glad to help in any way.  Just let me know.

Subject: Global Standard on Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval

Sally / Beth,

As we discussed when I was in Houston I have put together a draft on 
Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval. I had a meeting arranged 
for today to go through my proposal with Ted Murphy and Tani Nath (she heads 
up research and structuring here in London) but Ted cancelled at the last 
minute (again). Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement, but before we 
can go any further we need Ted's input. He is now away for 2 1/2 weeks so 
there is going to be no further progress on this front.

In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put 
together. I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this 
stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC 
perspective. Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I 
am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at 
least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding. Others will 
also need to be consulted (and I would like to agree a list of key people 
with you) but I can't see their being any real contention. Can you ?

I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston 
(and it may well be here too) and this has been added to the outstanding 
list. I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be 
completed as part of the curve validation 

If there are any questions or feedback please let me know.

James

John,

There has been a fair amount of discussion about this as well as the 
reporting of drift for the North America businesses.  Both Mike McConnell and 
Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.  I know 
that North America included US drift in its plan and includes ""drift 
earnings"" in its margin.  I believe you do the same in Europe.  Jeff is 
adamant that we not  move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has 
asked for UK drift to remain, as well.  You may want to call Jeff.  Sally and 
I will do what ever you guys decide.

I prepare the London Summary and I have been requested by John Sherriff here 
in London to have changes made to the reporting format of the Executive 
Viewer report.  John's request and the changes he has asked for are detailed 
below.  In essence, John would like excelr Europe's 'UK Drift' revenue to be 
reported under the 'excelr Europe' heading in the Exec Viewer instead of being 
reported under the 'Global Markets' heading.  If you agree to this change 
could you advise Chris Abel and Johnny Thibodeux to make the appropriate 
changes.  If, however,  you would like to discuss the matter further please 
contact John Sherriff.

Changes are required to the reporting format of excelr Europe's P/L in the 
Executive Viewer .  Below is a list of these changes as well as the person 
responsible for effecting each change:

Gary Hickerson: The UK Drift book is to be reclassified from the 'excelr 
Global Markets' heading to the 'excelr Europe' heading; 

Susie Ayala: The excelr Europe (Net Fair Value) Equity Investments book is to 
reclassified from 'Merchant Summary' to the 'excelr Europe' heading;

Chris Abel: The following changes are to be made to the books reported under 
the 'excelr Europe' heading:
 - J Block is to be reported as a separate line item;
 - Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives 
and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item); 
 - For each of the Electricty books, could you change the word Electricity to 
Power in the headings (for consistency purposes).

FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations

Last fall, the excelr Wholesale Services organization was created and 
announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.  All wholesale 
companies (excelr Americas, excelr Europe, excelr Global Markets and excelr 
Industrial Markets) plus excelr Net Works and excelr Global Assets were 
included in the excelr Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational 
memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was 
moved into excelr Net Works to align our operational services, information 
technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality 
services to excelr wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to 
evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as 
well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations 
teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.

Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we 
wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under excelr Net Works.  Senior 
management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to 
excelr Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks 
did not get fully executed.  

To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and 
non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately 
report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred 
to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting 
April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping 
purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' 
structure.

There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to excelr Net 
Works. Because you are transferring between excelr payroll companies, IRS 
requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only 
to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 
for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does 
not start over but continues as usual.

The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you 
on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden 
of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by 
filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the 
withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your 
tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.  
You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with 
any questions.  

We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you 
and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best 
practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, 
please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as 
identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is 
dedicated:

Subject: Telephone Outage excelr Houston

Sally, Bob - FYI 

I was able to get 5 telephone numbers set up on a temporary switch so if our 
counterparties call into the excelr building during the outage (Friday 10:00 
PM until Saturday 6 AM) they will get the voicemail of the 5 key schedulers 
that we selected. The voicemail gives the caller contact info. (page & home 
#'s). In addition if they hit zero it will be forwarded to our off-hours 
dispatching service. The dispatching service has current contact information 
for every pipe we do business on.  The schedulers were also instructed to 
call out to their key counterparties and make sure they have page, home and 
cell #'s.

If I had my way all of our schedulers telephone numbers would have been put 
on this temporary switch but five was the best we could do. Considering the 
time period I think we have minimal exposure however you never know when a 
pipeline of market emergency could occur. 

Let me know if you have any questions, tks - Bob

24548,beck-s/_sent_mail/766.,<20937044.1075856093898.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of 
what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  
Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term ""protocol"" 
into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the ""protocol"" is not 
anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply 
e:mails or memos between excelr and AEP with regard to any sharing of 
information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  
Operational details to be decided between excelr and AEP have been handled 
exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (excelr) 
to Steve Jackson (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally 
documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the 
original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for 
gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with excelr's treasury 
group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband 
in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an 
Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to 
that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in excelr's 
Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the 
amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition 
issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of 
you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have 
to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require 
actions by excelr will be our ""to do"" list.  Each item has a due date and we 
will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list 
or which appear in both the excelr and AEP list will be the items to which we 
will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or 
memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your 
requests earlier this week for written ""protocol"".   We will also update you 
weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and 
AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update 
on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest 
that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

 1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so 
that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and 
their status, or 

 2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a 
firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can 
incorporate that into our schedules for next week.

Subject: Material for Commodity Logic meeting

Sally, I have attached a brief document with the material you requested for 
Thursday's Commodity Logic meeting. 

Let me know if you would like to hand this out or just have me discuss 
without handouts. 

Tks - Bob Superty



",Non Abusive
24558,beck-s/_sent_mail/775.,<19909360.1075856094109.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of 
people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that 
team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that 
perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic 
has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team 
and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy 
Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through 
CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the 
facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in 
conversations around CommodityLogic. 

Staffing Contributions
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior 
Director
 CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist

 User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power 
Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements 

Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic

 NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)
 ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) 


Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, 
were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked 
in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  
Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles 
where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing 
both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the 
operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the 
past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project 
managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations 
experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most 
appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie 
on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very 
quickly.  

One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a 
scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over 
natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since 
Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was 
already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the 
project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to 
EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, 
who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom 
looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently 
renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange 
project team, and we transfered her along with the project to 
CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements 
work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is 
input from my group that has created the modules by defining user 
requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  
I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's 
participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a 
senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development 
background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was 
the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on 
CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her 
involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to 
CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is 
excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable 
operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie 
Reeves, who played a significant role in building excelr's power business from 
day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging 
products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and 
both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and 
back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their 
replacements on CommodityLogic.

the third year that excelr will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top

Sally - Plse see the attached summary that Risk Ops prepares for 
Frevert/Sherriff/Brown on excelr Europe every week.  Do your business unit 
controllers prepare something like this for the Americas, EGM, & EIM that we 
could use in our weekly briefing to Rick Buy?  What's happening is we try to 
prepare our own analysis of the trading P/L, and it really doesn't make much 
sense to do that since Ops is probably already doing it.  I'd love to get 
looped in to similar analyses for the other business units.  Also, do you 
know who I'd contact in  EES?  I'll call Barry Pearce for EBS.

Thank you,

Attached is a copy of the latest European Trading Summary. 
As this report contains the same information as the Rick Buy report, I 
suggested to Ted that we stop duplicating work and simply use this report.



The report is usually produced on Monday mornings UK time, so should be ready 
when the Rick gets in the office.
People to contact wrt co-ordination are, Michael Kass or his superior James 
New.

Please let me know if this report will be used in this week's Rick Buy report.

Subject: Ops Weekly Update

Ted mentioned to me that you guys receive or participate or just know of some 
type of weekly excelr Europe update on Fridays for Sherriff??? or some top guy 
over there, and that Risk Operations (New/Jordan etc.) prepare a report for 
that update.  Meanwhile, back in Houston we (MRM) independently prepare a 
weekly update for Rick Buy on Thursdays.  I'd like to get a copy of the 
report done last week, and talk to whoever in MRM participates, if anyone 
does, or if it's just Ops then whoever that is.  I think Ted was thinking we 
could leverage off this report and maybe move Rick Buy's weekly update back a 
day to coincide.

Do you know what I'm talking about?  Or should I talk to Lloyd or Oliver? I'd 
like to discuss after the morning meeting tomorrow if you have a minute - 
maybe you can also fax or e-mail the report?  

Thanks,
Cassandra.

Subject: VMS Project Next Steps

All,

It has been a very successful year for the excelr / Razorfish VMS project 
Team.  We have been developing a Direct Access Power Market, user managed, 
tariff based calculation engine and customer expense / revenue allocation 
application.

The efforts which have taken place to date will benefit each of us as we move 
forward into these deregulated Direct Access markets.  The current 
application has gone through the following evolution:

Project Definition & Design documentation
Database Design / Development
User Interface Design / Development
Communication layer (COM) Design / Development
Hardware requisition / Implementation (Development / Test / Production)
Arthur Anderson Audit (Passed Audit review - Application meets all minimum 
requirements)
The Major Functionality / Action Items which have been delivered to date:
Security Management (Only IT Resources to have access)
Event / Task Management & Reporting
Component / Equations Management & Reporting
Estimation Generation Management & Reporting
Counter Party Profile Management & Reporting
Settlement Entity Profile Management & Reporting
Deal-Upload Management & Reporting
Integrated Dispute Management & Reporting
Customer Generation Charge Profile & Reporting
Historical Data Conversion mechanism
95 % of Calculation Engine Original Functional Requirements

The Major Functionality which is under it's final steps of Development and 
User Test
Reconciliation (Exception Identification, Allocation & Reporting)
Settlement Entity - Settlement Statement / Invoice Parsing & Reporting
Remaining 5% of Calculation Engine Functionality

Over the past 12+ months a total of $3 MM dollars has been spend on VMS.  We 
are reaching the final phase of this project and I am not sensing that 
everyone is still on board with this being OUR (excelr) Volume Management 
strategic solutions for Direct Access Power Markets.

As of March 1, 2001 we no longer have a contract in place with Razorfish.  
Razorfish has provided six developers dedicated to assist the excelr Networks 
IT staff in delivering the VMS solution over the past year.  These resources 
have been key in helping us get to where we are today.  In addition we had 
originally planned to retain these resources over the remainder of 2001 
(03/2001 - 12/2001) to assist with the implementation of VMS on the West & 
East Desk and in the Toronto Canada office.  Without a contract in place and 
currently working on good faith.  The project has come to a serious point of 
action.  Razorfish is asking for a total of $728,000 for services rendered 
between 3/1/2001 and 6/30/2001.  They will keep the resources dedicated to 
the project and will deliver the following:
Finalise base product development, assist in unit / user testing and 
Implement base VMS Product in Production.
Application Production Support for 30 Days post Implementation
Transition of knowledge base from Razorfish resources to excelr Networks IT 
resources

Razorfish is willing to discuss terms to assist excelr throughout the 
remainder of the year.  However,  I don't feel that everyone is ready to make 
that decision.  We do however need to make a final decision on this first 
implementation.

As I have stated prior in this document,  ""We have accomplished a lot over 
the past year.""  Without the continued assistance from the Razorfish portion 
of the VMS team.  I don't see any of us meeting our 2001 Volume Management 
(VM) Direct Access Power Market objectives in a more efficient or economical 
fashion.  In some cases I don't see it being possible at all.

It is time to make a decision.  Do we all agree that we need to move forward 
and retain Razorfish services for the additional $728,000 and incur each of 
OUR allocation of the over all VMS capitalised project total cost or do we 
stop where we are and find other solution to address our needs and debate 
over who was in agreement in the beginning of the project in order to 
determine who picks up the $3 MM already spent.

Please provide me with your response by 5:00 PM PT to allow me to get back to 
Razorfish with a well deserved response by Friday.

Thanks - MO

a quick note to bring you up to date on some things. 

Commercialization Efforts- Services:  Delayed by several days due to the 
unexpected absence of Mary Solmonson for health reasons.  I learned about 
this when I returned to the office on Tuesday, and have worked to replace her 
as best we can during this market sizing phase.  Jennifer Denney (who was in 
Dallas with us and works under Sheri Thomas in the EOL Product Control Group) 
will partner with James Scribner in Mary's absence to help us run down 
additional data on potential customers.  Beth Apollo will be working closely 
with James and Jennifer.  They will welcome Rahil's help and will continue to 
work with Jennifer on developing the revenue model.  

Commercialization Efforts - Consulting:  Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made 
a presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for 
providing risk consulting services to external customers.  Some of his ideas 
overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas 
meeting.  Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk 
operations team.  I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort.  
Bjorn's vision is to create an excelr sub that will be the consulting 
company.  Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an 
accounting/consulting firm - established marketing arm, existing customer 
contacts, proven consulting skills, depth of resources, etc.  There could be 
a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us 
- we impart our risk knowledge, they get the edge in the marketplace from 
pairing with us, we take our upfront payment, they do most of the grinding 
work - not necessarily a bad model.  Bjorn seems to be in a hurry, as he has 
identified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting 
and is ready to pay.  Probably okay for him to start this effort in that 
way.  Prove concept, and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with 
someone else.  I spent some time with him today.  I want to be sure that he 
doesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and 
being in agreement with the fee structure.  We are okay for right now.  I 
will be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together 
if there is a good upside.  I will keep you posted.  

Commercialization Efforts - Internal Marketing:  We have to change some 
business practices within excelr and create a mind shift when originators are 
selling operational services to their customers.  We must price those and we 
must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations.  
Deal is in the works through power origination team - they priced our 
services to customer without our involvement- pricing may not even be 
sufficient to cover our costs.  We are researching.  To do's here are to 
create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to 
change DASH process so that Operations has a sign-off.  I met with Louise 
today on this.  I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week 
of March 19.  Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig 
teams.  I will get you a draft for your comments. 

Operational Risk:  Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in 
Portland.  Have worked with Stacey White (my power risk director) and Tim 
Belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work.  
I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan.  (We lost the manager of 
that group last week - a planned move to London to follow her husband to an 
excelr job there.  Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday 
of another risk book administrator from Portland.) 

Operational Risk:  Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale.  
End of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP.  We are 
working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues 
with customers after the sale effective date.  We expect to eliminate 46 
positions with the sale.  This number was much larger earlier in the year 
(around 70), but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale.  Bob 
Hall is focused on the details around this issue.  

Operational Risk:  We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office 
last week.  (This is the review of operational controls and procedures.)  
Went well - Max was skeptical about the process at first, but pleased in the 
end.  I will forward and e:mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of 
these reviews.  We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the 
remainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey.  He likes the 
revisions that we have made.  Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort.  

Spring Break Plans:  My children are on Spring Break the week of March 12 and 
the nanny has the week off.  We will be out of town through Wednesday, March 
13 with the whole family looking at colleges for Meagan.  Patti has contact 
numbers for me if needed.  I may decide to come back into the office on 
Thursday and Friday.  I will let Patti know when we get back in town.  I will 
either see you the end of next week, or back on Monday, March 19.  See 
separate e:mail for contact names and numbers in Operations while I am out.

Mike and Sally:

As you know, I attended the AAPL scholarship interviews conducted Tuesday, 
March 6 at OU.  Of the 23 students which interviewed, 3 are current or former 
excelr interns (Clay Shamblin, Michelle Terry, and Nadege Assale).

I have designated $1500 from my budget to be awarded at the EM Spring Awards 
Banquet which will be held April 20 on campus.  

I met with Jody Crook yesterday, and it is our recommendation to award $500 
to Clay, Michelle, and Nadege.  I think this will help impress upon the 
students how excelr values its interns.

The remaining candidates which interviewed ranged from Freshmen to Seniors, 
and I do not feel that awarding them money at this point would necessarily 
improve our success on campus.

I look forward to your feedback.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

John,

There has been a fair amount of discussion about this as well as the 
reporting of drift for the North America businesses.  Both Mike McConnell and 
Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.  I know 
that North America included US drift in its plan and includes ""drift 
earnings"" in its margin.  I believe you do the same in Europe.  Jeff is 
adamant that we not  move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has 
asked for UK drift to remain, as well.  You may want to call Jeff.  Sally and 
I will do what ever you guys decide.

I prepare the London Summary and I have been requested by John Sherriff here 
in London to have changes made to the reporting format of the Executive 
Viewer report.  John's request and the changes he has asked for are detailed 
below.  In essence, John would like excelr Europe's 'UK Drift' revenue to be 
reported under the 'excelr Europe' heading in the Exec Viewer instead of being 
reported under the 'Global Markets' heading.  If you agree to this change 
could you advise Chris Abel and Johnny Thibodeux to make the appropriate 
changes.  If, however,  you would like to discuss the matter further please 
contact John Sherriff.

Changes are required to the reporting format of excelr Europe's P/L in the 
Executive Viewer .  Below is a list of these changes as well as the person 
responsible for effecting each change:

Gary Hickerson: The UK Drift book is to be reclassified from the 'excelr 
Global Markets' heading to the 'excelr Europe' heading; 

Susie Ayala: The excelr Europe (Net Fair Value) Equity Investments book is to 
reclassified from 'Merchant Summary' to the 'excelr Europe' heading;

Chris Abel: The following changes are to be made to the books reported under 
the 'excelr Europe' heading:
 - J Block is to be reported as a separate line item;
 - Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives 
and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item); 
 - For each of the Electricty books, could you change the word Electricity to 
Power in the headings (for consistency purposes).

Max - Hi there, sounded like (from Jaime) you guys have had a busy week with 
various government officials.  I hope the result was good.

We all had a really helpful meeting here in Houston with those guys, and I 
just wanted to let you know that we have found a person to focus time on 
Mexico and work with Jaime and Agustin.  He is bi-lingual and very excited 
about the prospect.  We expect him to be proactive and help out quite a bit 
with setting up the new Mexico trading legal entity.   I have no doubt that 
this will fix most of the little issues that we discussed.  

We also assigned someone to come to Monterrey to set up Jaime and Agustin 
with system access where appropriate, and especially access to Livelink, our 
automated contract viewing system.  This should facilitate access to all 
Mexico contracts online (originals kept in Houston), and there should be no 
need to keep hard copies in Mexico.

Please let me know if you see any other areas where Energy Ops can help, or 
should be more involved.

Subject: FYI: STP and T+1

Sally,
I went to a seminar on Monday evening organised by a consultancy called The 
Capital Markets Company, who did the market analysis on the T+1 idea for the 
Global STP association.
Attendees were UBS Warburg, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Depository Trust 
Company etc
The subject was nominally how moving to T+1 settlement in the financial 
markets would affect STP, but it ended up going rather wider than that.
There were distinct echoes of some of the discussions at the ASE in Dallas, 
so I thought you might be interested to see some of the thoughts expressed:

It seemed that every bank was hoping to be able to sell the back-office 
services, but no-one seemed to be willing to buy!
Some people would only ever buy if there was more than one supplier, so that 
there was a competitive market.
Somebody will eventually break through to be able to offer the services.
One cannot avoid having to understand processes by outsourcing - one needs to 
understand the process in order to police the SLA.
Support personnel perceive that it will probably be 5 years before it becomes 
so difficult to make more more in the front office that there will be serious 
focus on saving money in the back office.
Nobody's compensation is realistically tied to achieving operational metrics.
Nothing will change until there is a crisis.
T+1 would just increase the number of fails. (this might be the crisis which 
would drive out the weaker players which would mean that the remaining 
players would be only dealing with better--organised counterparties which 
would decrease the number of fails)
This last point prompts the thought that the quickest way to generate lots of 
demand for EEO services from outside would be to have the standard cycle 
times reduced (have FERC insist?). But we would have to make sure we could 
cope to!

Subject: Wellesley Interview reschedule dates

Hello Team!!!

The rescheduled Wellesley interview dates are confirmed for March 13th and 
14th.  The tentative dates did not work because it was Spring Break for the 
students.  The Pre-Interview Reception will take place the 12th.  I am in 
need of interviewers still.  I am scheduling the same greeters to return.  
The participants so far are the following:

Please call me or e-mail as soon as possible if you can attend.  As you can 
see I need three interviewers.

24597,beck-s/_sent_mail/81.,<10779260.1075855914574.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Thanks for your comments on the standards.  Our approach in creating a global 
exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there.  Our 
initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical 
standards by the end of this year.  That will be a first, to on a daily basis 
have a view into the exceptions outside the global  standards.  Many of the 
measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the 
level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence 
of those that are managing these services.  Some of these may be more 
appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted 
within ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the 
wholesale merchant services companies.  Give me a call and we can set a time 
to get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with 
you.  

We spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations 
controllers reviewing and discussing these standards.  Shona has taken a stab 
at the format of these exception reports.  It is likely that we will have a 
rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of 
these reports, so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these 
reports.  

Yes, we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for 
these activities.  My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute, 
but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as 
needed to clear the exceptions.  It is invariably the deals that are 
exceptions in some way that create the problems.  For instance, small power 
deals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up.  These 
were ""on the side"" and not captured in total power exposure because they 
didn't have a book to put them in (a discovery during the doorstep review).  
If this goes on the exception report, then we can highjack someone in risk in 
Houston to help Calgary set up a new book, or get IT resources focused 
quickly on any solution that may require their input to fix.  By having a 
prescribed elevation of these exceptions, we should get the appropriate 
attention to correct them.  The spur for making sure that all exceptions are 
appropriately noted, will be that if there is a problem with any deal that 
was an exception (not in the books, no confirm, etc.) and was not included on 
the exception report, that this will be grounds for termination for the 
appropriate operations controller.  I will make sure that as we start this 
reporting process that this is well understood.  The other impetus will be 
that during doorstep reviews the operational activities will be gauged 
against these standards.  The AA internal audits should also access adherence 
to these.

Subject: Fundamental Operating Standards


This is the first time I have seen these - have they been rolled out ?

I would be interested to see the format of the exception reporting that 
attaches to these standards that you mentioned - did you have anything 
particular in mind ?

I had a few of my own ideas for some diagnostic measures of the extent to 
which these standards are being adhered to - see what you think:

Transactions are recorded accurately and timely (completeness, accuracy)

Daily report of ""holdovers"" by commodity group (trades not booked in time for 
daily cut - off, including counterparty, volume, price etc)
Report of P&L effect of booking errors as they transpire, including 
responsibility

Daily Management P&L and Position reporting is accurate and timely 
(completeness, accuracy)

Periodic qualitative review by RAC (i.e. Is it sufficient by reference to the 
Risk Management Policy - does it show delta gamma vega as a term structure 
etc....)

NB: the point about ""Reports issued on next day of trading at a commercially 
pre-determined time"" conflicts with the Risk Managemet Policy, which says 
""...before any subsequent trading ocurrs"". I think the diagnostic measure 
should be, for each commodity DPR a report daily of all those signed off as 
final (note I do not neccessarily mean ""officialized"") after the relevant 
market opening time (usuaully 7.30 am)

Timely confirmation and execution of transactions (completeness, accuracy, 
existence)

Monthly report of all unmatched confirmations:

- outstanding inward confirmations (i.e. sent out, not signed) 
- outstanding outward confirmations (i.e deal done, confirm not sent) 
- outstanding mismatched or disputed confirmations

showing deal trade date, start date, commodity, counterparty, MTM value, aged

Settlements with counterparties occurs accurately and timely (non CACS, non 
Dashed deals)

Monthly report of cumulative amounts of all unmatched or unapplied cash:

Unapplied cash by counterparty, in original denomination, including deal 
reference if any
Unmatched amounts by deal, where settled amount differs from maturing forward 
MTM value

One additional thing that ocurred to me was the fact that those responsible 
for supplying the information are also those responsible for the operation 
underlying it in some sense, so the obvious pitfalls of self - assessment 
will come into play here. Perhaps the ""pilot"" report should be put together 
somehow independently.

Views ?

From: Karen Marshall, University Affairs
 

I want to thank each of you for your past participation in the selection 
process of the recipients of the UT excelr MBA Excellence Scholarships.  As 
you know, the excelr Endowed scholarships are part of a $3 million gift to the 
school  with $1 million earmarked to endow the excelr UT MBA excellence fund.  
Our scholarships are among the largest at the McCombs School of Business and 
it is important to seek the highest level of involvement for the selection of 
this prestigious award.  Because of your knowledge of the company, your  
judgement and your leadership ability, I am soliciting your help again in 
selecting the recipients of the 2001 scholarships.  

The school has submitted sixteen outstanding candidates for excelr's 
consideration and are confident that we are reviewing the very best out of 
over 100 first year MBA students who actually applied for our scholarships.  
It is now up to us to determine who the final 3 recipients of the $10,000 
scholarships will be.  We are seeking the best and brightest students who 
exemplify the vision, values and beliefs of excelr, regardless of commitment 
to a career in energy.   

In order to expedite the process, I am sending you  the package  with the 16 
applicants for your review.  I would like to get your feedback in rank order 
of the top 8 candidates no later than March 16th.  After we have narrowed the 
pool down  to the top 8 candidates, I will contact the students and arrange 
for a face to face interview in Austin with the excelr team members that are 
able to travel to UT  to make the final selection of the winners.

The school has a very tight deadline that we must comply with for the 
selection of candidates.   Below is a timeline of the process: 

March   6, 2001  - Send applications to excelr Team for review
March 16, 2001 -  Reply to Karen Marshall with the ranking of the top 8 
candidates based on the application
March 19,  2001 - Schedule interviews on campus with excelr team and 
scholarship applicants
March 26, 2001 -   Week of March 26 students are interviewed and winners 
selected
March 29, 2001 -   Announcement of Scholarship  Winners 
April 16, 2001    -  Week of April 16th, schedule a small intimate luncheon 
with excelr executive and the scholarship winners
Sept 10, 2001-      Week of Sept 10th, schedule Scholarship Award Dinner for 
winners and their family, the faculty, the Dean and the excelr team 

If your schedule does not allow you to participate in the selection process 
this year, please let me know immediately so that we don't miss the 
deadlines.  

Thank you in advance for your support.

Ms. Beck,

My name is Ashley Worthing and I just started with excelr about 3 months ago.  
I was wondering if there is any possibility that your mothers name is Sue and 
her maiden name is Worthing?  If I am completely off, I apologize in 
advance...my father, aunt and uncles wanted me to see if I could find you, or 
if this is you.

Thank you,

Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified

I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a 
short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on 
potential acquisitions.  We have identified our target teams for due 
diligence efforts around commodities.  While each person on the list has 
other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted 
to projects as they arise.  I will review this list continually and update it 
as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent 
job as part of a due diligence team.  I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had 
created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG 
acquisition.  We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this 
checklist so that all are prepared.  Let me know if you are interested in the 
names on my list.  Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence 
effort.  

Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business

I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the 
executive summary from the consulting team.  I followed up with Brent Price 
(my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an 
appropriate infrastructure to support that business.  Currently, Todd Hall 
and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.  Todd has 
other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time 
that Todd would have.  Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the 
lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.  She will be returning to 
Houston from the London office by the end of March.  She will be able to 
split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.  Todd will stay 
involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.  We will also 
keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.  Shelley is expected 
to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week 
regarding our plans.  I will keep you posted. ",Non Abusive

reported to Mary Solmonson within my organization.  The group was led by a 
director, and consisted of 2 managers, 1 senior specialist and 4 
specialists.  The employees were made aware of this decision last Friday 
afternoon.  My HR rep was on hand to explain the help that all will receive 
in finding new assignments within excelr through the excelr Corp. Re-deployment 
Team.  Mary Solmonson continues as one of my direct reports, focused on 
CommodityLogic and our business development efforts regarding the 
commercialization of mid and back office services.  

As part of my on-going effort to deliver both the best value and quality of 
service within Energy Operations, I reviewed core versus non-core activities 
within my team.  I am committed to investing appropriately in people 
resources to support core activities.  And I believe that we can become even 
more effective if investments in non-core activities are eliminated.    The 
role played by the Strategic Intiatives team in coordinating systems projects 
will be more appropriately shouldered by the IT project leads and the 
respective business sponsors/end users.  The ""middle-man"" role played by the 
Strategic Initiatives team had ceased to deliver appropriate value.

My first note to you around disbanding Joel's group was the best overall 
summary of reasons to disband the team.  In addition, Joel and his team had 
recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the 
projects in which they were involved.  The update had the exact opposite 
effect that Joel wanted, I am sure.  After the two hour session, it appeared 
to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth, 
fulfilling IT's roles in some cases, not communicating with the rest of my 
direct report team (if your role is be a liaison, then communication is a 
necessary component of the role), struggling to create a role for themselves, 
etc.  If my reaction had been to say ""what a talented group - we have to 
figure out how to best utilize them"", then the outcome might have been 
different.  But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well.  That two 
hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs 
for the team without commensurate value, that I couldn't in good conscious 
make any other decision after further investigation.  --Sally

Subject: Disbanding of Joel Henenberg's Team

I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under excelr Americas to 
reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied 
possible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the best 
decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of 
core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value 
proposition.

As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.  
To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will 
lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end 
users.   

Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week.  
Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate 
re-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few 
weeks.  
Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.  While it was a tough 
decision, I feel comfortable having made it.

Hey,

It was so fun being  with you on Saturday.? It is always nice when someone

Actually do wish you  were closer...although I am grateful that you are no 
further than  Houston.

What did you think  of the scrapbook idea for Mom and Dad?? That is something 
that I could do  that would involve labor--will not be able to make a huge 
contribution  $-wise.? (If Cara did not pass on the scrapbook idea to you let 
me  know!)
?
Also, setup an  automatic payment each month to begin to pay you back.? It is 
a fairly  paltry sum ($35) at this point but wanted to at least get 
started....hopefully  will be able to increase it at some soon in the future.

I just wanted to send a quick congratulatory note on your promotion to 
Managing Director.  And a bit belated, a thank you for serving again as my

again, was one of the few Analysts or Associates who was always kept informed 
about the process.  I appreciate your time and energy in representing me.

Subject: Wholesale Deal Meetings

The following is from Mike Patrick:

Wes Colwell's Hot List Meetings have previously been held on Thursdays at 
1:30pm and attended by various parties.  This meeting has been replaced by 
the Wholesale Deal Meeting to be held at the same time and location.  The 
attendees will be comprised of each Wholesale Business Unit's CAO, 
Transaction Support lead, Tax lead and Energy Operations management.  The 
meeting will be held bi-weekly and will be adjusted as necessary.   Please 
note that the first meeting will be held tomorrow, Thursday February 22 at 
1:30pm in EB3321.

The purpose of this meeting is :

1) For the CAO/Transaction support lead to summarize the Top 3 deals for the 
quarter in each business unit, focusing on any potential issues that might 
derail the closing of the deal, and

2) For the Transaction Support team to update the group on any global 
accounting issues, and

3) To create/maintain a ""Wholesale Critical Deal Sheet"" comprised of 
Wholesale's Top Ten critical deals

The meeting is not intended to be a business unit administration meeting 
(i.e., floor space, SAP, etc.).  I believe Wes still plans to hold a 
Wholesale CAO meeting to discuss other non-deal issues.

Following are the dates of the upcoming meetings.  The meetings will be held 
from 1:30pm - 2:30pm in EB3321.

what is currently reported in the DPR (accrual vs mtm)
company/location groups - what we are currently not capturing
relationship with the risk policy
Economic vs earnings risk - what should be captured

I strongly encourage you to attend as your input will be very valuable in

Subject: NABA photo shoot


EES and Sally Beck's organization in EWS are joining forces to underwrite
excelr's recruiting presence at the 30th Annual National Association of
Black Accountants National Conference and Job Fair this August in Dallas,
Texas.  NABA is an professional organization of 100,000 African Americans
in the fields of accounting, finance, consulting and IT.

We are planning a photo shoot of a check presentation to the Executive
Director of NABA, who is making a special trip to Houston for this purpose.
The photo and caption will appear in the pre-conference NABA newsletter to
its members (not a paid advertisement).  We would like to have Cindy,
Sally, Wes, Ted and the representative from EES in the photo, if possible.
We also need to decide whose signature should appear on the mocked up check
for the photo - what do you think?

We are checking on dates for the shoot now, and Debbie Nowak will be
contacting you/your assistants to check for your availability.  (likely
contenders are Feb 23 around mid-day and March 2)

We are excited about excelr's participation in this conference and look
forward to some great hires.

Thanks,

some strong candidates.  If you want me for the photo shoot, February 23 
looks good.  I will be out of the office on March 2nd - two days of vacation 
on March 2 and 5 to chaperone Meagan's drill team to state competition in 
Dallas.  With 90 girls on the team, that should be fun but exhausting!  

It was great to see you and Grady last night at the rodeo.  Let's definitely 
plan on a ball game in April as a chance to catch up.  I just checked the 
calendar, and it looks like we are on for lunch on March 28!!  A few weeks 
away, but at least it is on the calendar!  If your schedule were to free up 
suddenly, just give me a call and I can see if I could change mine to have 
lunch sooner.  --Sally

Subject: NABA photo shoot

EES and Sally Beck's organization in EWS are joining forces to underwrite 
excelr's recruiting presence at the 30th Annual National Association of Black 
Accountants National Conference and Job Fair this August in Dallas, Texas.  
NABA is an professional organization of 100,000 African Americans in the 
fields of accounting, finance, consulting and IT.  

We are planning a photo shoot of a check presentation to the Executive 
Director of NABA, who is making a special trip to Houston for this purpose.  
The photo and caption will appear in the pre-conference NABA newsletter to 
its members (not a paid advertisement).  We would like to have Cindy, Sally, 
Wes, Ted and the representative from EES in the photo, if possible.  We also 
need to decide whose signature should appear on the mocked up check for the 
photo - what do you think?

We are checking on dates for the shoot now, and Debbie Nowak will be 
contacting you/your assistants to check for your availability.  (likely 
contenders are Feb 23 around mid-day and March 2)

We are excited about excelr's participation in this conference and look 
forward to some great hires.

Thanks,

Gwynn

Subject: 2001 Group Expenses

Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.



Regards
Delainey

was walking with another prego from the office.

Your payment offer is very generous;  I""m sure we can work it out.  I have
no problem putting it on my card for now.  We have the go-ahead from Cindy,
too - so I think I will go ahead and confirm with Jeffrey's this week.  When
you come in next weekend, maybe we can all look at the sample menus, and get
that decided as well.

Maybe we should send a little ""save the date"" note to the cousins to let
them know?   I would be glad to do that.

Thanks for your input.   I bet I will talk with you later today, on your
special day!    -cara

Hi, sistas-

Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed ""17"" with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here's a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into
thirds

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to

Sally -
When I heard the rumour this week about Louise Kitchen transferring out of 
Networks, I was hoping they'd say you were moving to the Office of the Chair 
at Networks!  Do you think a non-commercial MD will ever make it to Office of 
Chair?  If anyone can, you'll do it.

excelr is forming a new organization - - the excelr Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at excelr.  excelr's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of excelr Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at excelr, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of excelr's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in excelr.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of excelr Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of excelr Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from excelr Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in excelr Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in excelr Americas, where she has been successful in many of excelr Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus

24653,beck-s/_sent_mail/860.,<21850633.1075856096020.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the 
mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale 
businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around 
mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test 
- i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of 
transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.  
Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of 
explaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does 
happen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we 
believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where 
operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. 

These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which 
excelr has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely 
designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to 
produce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and 
potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that 
are valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage 
success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class 
practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep 
review process would follow this set of steps:

 1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This 
is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be 
notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain 
that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town. 

 2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell 
them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in 
making information and personnel available to complete the review.  

 3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key 
commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and 
key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The 
deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process 
and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  

 4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of 
the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those 
which may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested.  
This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually 
very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support 
their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an 
additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with 
this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support 
the growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office 
know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing 
so. 

 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be 
reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls 
and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, 
assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate 
personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume 
responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and 
to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.  
Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey 
to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, 
doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep 
findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep 
teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each 
doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me 
sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick 
before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular 
concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more 
timely manner than quarterly.   

Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in 
Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors 
in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not 
concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the 
integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were 
discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with excelr's 
practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley 
was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted 
Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was 
for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  

Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from 
Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the 
case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I 
know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you 
would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when 
they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as 
a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in 
this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert 
them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the 
level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing 
directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and 
myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the 
download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice 
mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a 
meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me.  
In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona 
mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked 
for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the 
integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control 
which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  

To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the 
heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is 
to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to 
offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire 
excelr organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The 
findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, 
which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to 
""over-wordsmith"" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be 
surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can 
reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical 
perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  

I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with 
you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as 
valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain 
members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other 
businesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any 
suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process.",Non Abusive

Patti is setting up my meeting with James for Friday.  I just left her a 
message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for - plus I 
will leave you a message after I have talked with him.  I hope to have that 
meeting with James at 10:30.  

Interruptions have been rampant - and I am still not finished with reviews.  
Shona will actually be in Calgary at the same time that I will be, so we will 
do her review on the plane, in the airport or at the hotel - and I will tell 
her about the reorg.  Again, I will leave you a message to let you know that 
we have had that conversation.  

That's great to have dinner with Lou.  I think that it would be good to find 
out from him what sort of interaction he has with the London office, what's 
working, what's not working - in an informal way.  Are they on an excelr 
network?  Do they get excelr e:mails?  How often does Lou go to London or 
someone from London mid office come to New York?  I still suspect that New 
York is somewhat neglected just because of the distance between London and 
New York and the fact that there seems to be plenty for Mike and his team to 
chew on in London.  Particularly now with a renewed focus on the scrap metal 
business.  

Enrjoy the OpRisk Conference.  They tend to be heavily attended by bankers 
and there focus is that direction as well, but there is a lot that we can 
glean from what they are doing.  It snowed there a lot yesterday.  Of course, 
according to Peggy Hedstrom, it is 0 degrees (daytime temp reading) and snowy 
in Calgary.  

I look forward to seeing you in Dallas.  --Sally

Will start to check into this.  I would like to see the training, so I can 
get familiar with the product.  Have they delivered it in Houston at all?

Thanks for the Heads up on James for Friday.  I will be in NY at the 
conference, but at least that clears the way for me to start getting busy 
when we get back from the ASE on Wed.

I am having dinner with Lou Colorusso, one of the Metals guys in NY on 
Thursday night.   Marcello declined.  Any issues you think I should discuss 
with him?   I know there is a doorstep outstanding for the NY office.  I will 
get the scoop from Shona on those results before I go.

How did Shona take the news yesterday.  I will wait for your go ahead to make 
contact with her on the re-organization.

Enjoy the trip to Calgary.  I will see you in Dallas on Monday morning.

Subject: EnTelligence Training

Please mark your calendars for EnTelligence Training on February 22nd.  
EnTelligence is a system developed by excelr that provides a prospecting and 
management reporting website combining information from internal and external 
systems.  New enhancements to the system now provide Activity Detail reports 
by counterparty.  It also contains Family Tree information for companies 
(i.e. subsidiaries, division of... etc.).  Avril Forster from the Houston 
office will be providing the training.

We will divide the training into three sessions on February 22nd  as follows:

10:00 - 12:00 Origination team training
1:30 - 2:30 Energy Operations team training 
3:00 - 5:00 Trading team training 

All training will be in the Video #2 boardroom (next to Liz Prior).  Please 
make every effort to attend this training.  Hopefully, you will find the 
EnTelligence system a useful tool for each of you.  If you have any questions 
or concerns, please let me know.

to Connecticut soon to join her husband.  He has been working up there for 
the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our 
weather derivatives team about a year ago.  She hopes to continue to work for 
excelr - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I 
can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in excelr's New York 
office.  

It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn 
could be someone for you to consider.   She came originally from the London 
office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some 
feedback on her.  In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very 
early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.  She came to 
Houston and  has done a number of different things.  I think that she is well 
organized and control minded.  Understands excelr's business.  Managing a 
group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.  I am not sure that 
people enjoy working under her.  That could be old news, however.  There are 
a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her 
based on very recent experience.  Do you know of her?  

Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.  
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.  She would 
definitely represent an excelr point of view.  They have two small daughters - 
she might be interested in something part time even.  Could mean lower cost 
that way.  

This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.  
If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you 
could go to for some fact finding around her.  Let me know.  --Sally   ",Non Abusive

Sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it

I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another 
thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to 
an Astro's game.  I have season tickets through excelr and can buy blocks of 
tickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to 
see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could 
discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  

I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large 
number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied 
up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls

Thanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little 
travelling at the end of the year.  Report from the Calgary office today is 
that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime 
tempurature reading!).

I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.  I will leave with 
David the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that 
is needed while I am out of town.  --Sally

Sally:? I am refiguring this meeting...I have tried three  places and can not 
find a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance,  so I checked 
notes...you were correct, Pam Martins dad and Emily U. dad were  both 
volunteered by their wives, I will check them out this evening.? I  have call 
into Bob Lindsay, policeman and NCL dad, about safety.. we will  see.? I 
thought I might try to get some brief info from Ann YOung on  Applause 
Theatre, our new phil.? On nominations, there were a couple of  girls who did 
not complete info sheets last time, I will call them  tonight.? Also, I can 
check with the three on nominations and see when they  are available, will 
let you know.? If you don't mind having regular  ticktocker meeting at your 
house, that would be great.? If all else fails,  Sarah Marshall (yes, that is 
right) probably knows more about car care than  anyone I know...the girls 
call her if their car doesn't start.? Her theory  is that the first thing is 
to turn down the_______ radio as you are backing out  the drive, so you can 
hear your car...pretty basic.?
Summary:? Can we do TT meeting at your house?? I  will email agenda for that 
meeting to you.? I will have Abi check with  girls about nominations and let 
you know when they can meet...we will go from  there.? Is this okay with 
you.? This is the meeting I thought we might  dd Dad/ dtr but too close, so 
we better come up with another idea....dance  lesson, maybe...think Megan 
suggested that.? 
?
Have a good trip. Linda

Subject: Recycling Summary Integration plan

Please find attached the summary integration plan that you requested during 
our debriefing last week. 

The first part of the table shows the controls objectives and the controls in 
place at 31 Dec 2000 when excelr Metal Recycling was divided into two halves: 
MGMR and Bergman.  Our overall controls assessment per risk at that stage was 
level 2 (below average controls).  

We have sumarised the implementation steps required to achieve an increase in 
controls assessment to level 3 (average), 4 (good)  or 5 (excellent) in each 
case,  along with latest completion dates to achieve those controls. 

We have then added a column of comments on the actual implementation with a 
bar chart to show how far advanced the work is.  The revised controls 
assessment at 31 Jan shows an average of 2.5 and our plan should enable the 
controls to be around a level 3 (average) by end of February. 

We will issue a revised table monthly in order to clearly update you on our 
progress.  If you would like to schedule a specific meeting to go through any 
of the points or queries that you may have, please let me know and I will 
organise.

Many thanks

As you know, HPL is a gas utility subject to Texas Railroad Commission 
(""RRC"") jurisdiction, and as such HPL must comply with relevant statutes and 
regulations.  Two RRC regulatory reporting matters in which I have been 
involved are HPL's Gas Utility General Annual Report and tariffs.  I have 
concluded that the way in which these filings are accomplished, and 
particularly the information systems used in the processes, should be 
reviewed.  Mike Eiben and Bob Hall have also been involved in this process 
(although Bob came in only recently) and are much more familiar with the 
intricacies of the process and systems than I.  Rather than going into detail 
in this memo, I intend to set up a meeting soon for the addressees of this 
memo to discuss the situation.

This was our first third party auction.  Although we had some major technical

We will divide the training into three sessions on February 22nd  as follows:

10:00 - 12:00 Origination team training
1:30 - 2:30 Energy Operations team training 
3:00 - 5:00 Trading team training

Subject: ASE Draft Agenda Walkthrough

Hello folks -

As we discussed in the initial sponsor meeting, we would like to have a 
preliminary walkthrough of the ASE Studio Workshop draft agenda.  We are 
targeting this discussion for either Tuesday or Wednesday morning and will 
need about 1 to 1 1/2 hours for a thorough review.  Please let me know when 
you can meet and I will arrange the logistics.

Thanks

and February meeting!  Was it car care and car safety that we had planned for 
Feb?  And do we have a volunteer to host the meeting?  I could certainly host 
if needed.  Did you have a constable or someone in mind to talk with the 
girls about car safety?  I would be glad to call them and make arrangements 
if you let me know.  Any ideas on car care?  Seems like Joy Martin mentioned 
her husband as a possible ""expert"" there.  Or should we try to call Firestone 
or Jiffy Lube or one of those spots to get a speaker?  I am headed to Calgary 
for Wednesday and Thursday this week, but can make plenty of phone calls 
before I leave.  

On nominating committee, I have a list of offices held over the years by the 
girls that will be needed by the nominating committee.  I would be glad to 
meet with the girls on the committee either Thursday night (I land from 
Calgary around 6:00 pm), Friday night or Saturday.  I can get you this list 
if you need to meet with the committee before then.  It may be tough to get 
the girls together, but am I correct in assuming that they need to present a 
slate at our Feb meeting and then they vote in March?  

The symphony open rehearsal sounds good - 10:30 am on Saturday, March 31; buy 
tickets at the door ($4).  Problem is that SAT's are given that day.  Meagan 
is signed up to take them.  I wonder how many others may be taking the SAT 
that day?  If there are only a few conflicts, we could go ahead and it's okay 
if Meagan misses.  If we have a lot of conflicts, then this may not work.  
Maybe we could get Merritt to e:mail this question to the girls when she 
contacts them about this weekend's meeting.  They could check their schedules 
and then we could get a count.  I will also look into other possible dates 
and get availability and prices on tickets just in case.  

I will try to call you after a lunch time meeting today.  --Sally

Subject: Fundamental Operating Standards

Attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls 
that have been developed by the Wholesale Services group.  These standards 
are to be met by all excelr offices and by each functional group within the 
operations process.  Qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic 
measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity.  
Statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored 
on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately.

As business unit heads, you play a critical role in working with Operations 
to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively.  Please 
review this document and let me know if you have any questions or wish to 
discuss further.

Regards,

Brent

Cassandra,
I think Michael's issue is just one for you and Shona to worry about and try 
to simultaneously come up with a way to diffuse without bastardizing the 
process. .  I continue to say the we need to maintain the theme that speed 
and ""gut reaction"" is preferable to consensus and prosecutable evidence,  I 
feel so strongly about this that I would consider removing my team from 
involvement if politically correct, grammatically sound and properly 
researched reports that do not say anything or are stale or are full of 
ambiguity are the end result (see the internal audit report on 
Helsinki!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!).   I think the solution is make it clear that these reports are not to 
be used for prosecution but frank discussion.
I am right about this.
Please forward this to Shona/Sally/Mike or anyone else at your discretion 
(this is a compromise between Evil Ted and Zen Ted)

their old PLM (Petroleum Land Management) program into the Energy Management 
Program in the School of Business.  This undergraduate degree retains the

program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a

up in or around ""energy"" families in Oklahoma or Texas, I thought that 
recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to excelr.  Our 
recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy 
Management graduates have done well at excelr.

Subject: resume

I received this resume through some contacts in the Houston chapter of the 
National Society of Hispanic MBAs.  He is interested in excelr, period.  (I 
called him to clarify his interests:  he is happy for an opportunity to use 
his bilingual skills, and is therefore interested in excelr Europe and Latin 
America, as well as Houston.  He is perfectly content to stay in Houston, 
though.)  

Let me know if this resume looks interesting to you.  Also, who should I send 
this to in London?

Gwynn,
First I would like to introduce myself.  My name is Javier Fernandez and I am
the Treasurer of the National Society of Hispanic MBA's Houston chapter.

I had a meeting with Martha Salinas and Kornel Rost this past weekend and
they mentioned that you are looking for bilingual MBA's to help with
European operations.  I am attaching my resume for your review.

As my resume shows, I have an MBA in International Business and am a CPA in
the State of Texas.  I have several years experience in finance and am
looking for something that meets my background.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments and
thank you very much for your time.

Best Regards,
Javier Fernandez

I think it would be great if you could attend on both dates.  However, the 
more important of the two would be March 6 as that would allow you to hear 
the students interview and assess their skills.

There is a slim chance that Mike could attend the event in April.  Jody Crook 
plans on attending that event, too.  I will be at both events, so there will 
be an excelr face at both events.

Please let me know if you will be available.

Thank you,

Lexi

Mike and Sally:

I have been in contact with Ted Jacobs and have volunteered $1500 in 
scholarship funds to be awarded by excelr this spring.  By volunteering this 
money, we are now able to attend scholarship interviews on Tuesday, March 6 
on campus.  This will provide us with the opportunity to target candidates 
for next fall and lay the groundwork for a more competitive future.

After we have identified our scholarship recipients, we are invited to 
present our awards at the Scholarship Awards Banquet on Friday, April 20.  

Ted will (if he has not already) approach you, Mike, to see if you are 
interested in playing a role at this event.   If you are available to attend, 
please let me know.  I plan to have at least 2 excelr representatives at the 
event.

I just wanted to give each of you these details to keep you fully informed of 
our efforts on campus.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please let 
me know.


Thank you,

Sally,

I talked to mother last night about the dinner idea---boy is she hard to
read on this--told her out idea about a dinner in town and that she might
want to invite cousins--told her we probably wanted to go ahead a reserve it
because June was a busy time---she said she'd talk to Dad and then let me
know!!!????!!!????

As an aside, Brigeda's school year will be extended a week--until 6/1
because of losing a week for the air quality testing--so am not sure if we
could have made the N.C. deal anyway....

If I get to be like Mom or Dad, smack me around, ok?

Cindy

A ""Doorstep"" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our

action on this up to and including shutting it down. This was the worst we 
have seen at excelr and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard 
was going on there. 

We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there 
isn't one already. I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate 
action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better. 
More to come.

Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over 
Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a

only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two 
beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds.  
Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two rooms, 
one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would probably do 
that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five is almost too

Hello, Sista -

Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well) -
and here's the latest idea:

Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, how
about we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - during
THanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at that
time - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks maybe
we could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the Thanksgiving travel
MADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which may
help you.

Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom and
dad would like that.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Check out the website for the place in Asheville, NC that I mentioned to 
you.  Address is richmondhillinn.com - if I knew how to hotlink for you I 
would, but I am not the techie!!  We had dinner there one night while in 
Asheville and had a great meal and though that the place was pretty -  a lot 
better than the overpriced, under-delivered Grove Park Inn.  Our friends the 
Tylers spent several nights at the Richmond Inn that same summer.  It looks 
pretty good in the photos, and you can see the mountains!!

Only airlines that fly from here into Asheville are Delta and US Air.  
Continental flies to Greenville/Spartanville, SC which is about 60 to 70 
miles from Asheville - not impossible, given that we would want some cars.  

I will get info on prices and stuff for lodging and airfare - then we can 
decide if we want to show this to Mom and Dad as a possibility.

their Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas. =20

I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desig=

various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups. If you=

to be very successful.  Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20
methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.

A limited number of representatives from excelr will be attending.  You were=
=20
selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th=
e=20
DesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as=
=20
little distraction or interruption as possible.  The quality of our results=
=20
depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the=
=20
entire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor=
t=20
and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. =
=20
This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s=
o=20
that your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all=20
necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during=
=20
these two days.

Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,=

and transportation.  Preliminary information as to schedule and environment=

has also been included.  You may direct any additional questions concerning=

the event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.

First of all congratulations on your promotion, it is well deserved.  You are 
really in some rarefied air, since there seem to be very few Managing 
Directors.

I also would like to compliment you on putting together one of the best  2 
1/2  hour seminars / workshops that I have ever attended ( I know that is 
saying a mouthful).  The Operational Risk Meeting / Workshop was not only 
informative, but the constantly changing formats kept everyone's attention.   
I believe the meeting also caused a renewed enthusiasm among your supervisory 
personnel.  This is not only my observation, but the feeling of all of the 
people that I have talked to over the past few weeks. 

Once again, congrats.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I will see you on Monday the 29th.  If anything comes up next week, I can be 
reached at my new temporary home (mother in-laws)  713 520 0766

Also  -- I believe Fernley has passed the Merit raise part of this year end 
comp review over to you, so I thought I would give you the facts.

Base salary $165,000
Foreign Adjustment  $30,000     these two items will go away on Jan 28th  --- 
and I am left with the base salary
Car Allowance           $12000

total regular pay     $207,000

also  -- they have had me on a 2 year contract  (not sure if they do that in 
Houston, but I am willing)  which had some annual cash kickers)


We can discuss when I get there, but in case you need it next week, just 
thought it couldn't hurt.


Looking forward to a fresh start and new challenges.


see you soon

Subject: Clearing User Meetings

I have attached the e-mail that Ron Nolte sent to the Deal Clearing user 
community regarding the meeting
that is scheduled for November 16-17.   Please note that this is a meeting 
organized by the IT community, not
the user community.

As you may remember, Stephen Schwarz organized a similar meeting last fall in 
order to provide the IT group
with an agenda of what projects the user community considered to be priority 
projects.  However, the arrival of
EOL greatly altered the IT resources available to concentrate on those 
priority projects.  Today, the deal 
clearing community is struggling to get IT resources due to new systems such 
as ClickPaper.com, Commodity
Logic, project Thunderball  and a new weather capture and confirmation 
system.  This has created some internal 
conflict since each user group supported by the IT deal clearing applications 
group is requesting that their projects 
be set as the top priority project.  

This is a quick outline of the challenges facing both the deal clearing user 
community and the IT group supporting
this group.  I would be happy to discuss any questions you have about either 
the meeting or these challenges.

Sally,
 I added league hours to your hours report for you as you attended all
patroness meetings (Oct and Nov) and the Holiday Tea.  I added 5 hours for
those meetings for a total 12 for this qtr. If it should be more, let me
know.  I wasn't there in Oct.  That makes your year to date league 33.5.

Fred would like me to hire an additional person to strictly focus on his 
deals across all commodities.  He says that his people don't have time to 
look at these reports.  Also,  Scott Neal wants 11 new physical books on the 
east region.  This will require at least two more risk people,  and probably 
two new OA people.  We told him that yesterday,  and he was fine with that.

Have you had a chance to look at UT presentation for Monday?  I will need to 
email final copy to Lexi by Monday morning (her flight is 2:00 PM) and she 
would like a cd for backup.  I can handle that.  She has supplied me with new

as your assistant and what I can do to better assist you.  You know, this job 
that I have now with you is the job I have waited for all my life.  It is 
challenging, fast-paced, and has a lot of potential for growth.  You make me

changes that the girls' might suggest, but I think that it would be wonderful 
to have their input.  They are the honorees.  Oh, well .....as you say, this

Sally:? Hope all is well in London, it could not be more  ""soupy"", rainy or 
overcast than it has been here.? Sunday is shaping  up...Nancy at Elegant 
Accessories by Nancy has a presentation for us, but is  unable to give it due 
to market or show or something.? I will pick it up  from her and run through 
it on Sunday.? I am trying to get Debbie VanDyke  to do Habitat and the lady 
from Applause to come.? Have been working on  form for Nominations...The 
meeting is at Nancy Galante's house, I have spoken to  her about the girls 
listing favorite things from Sat. pm and she was (nicely)  opposed to that, 
as the girls really only get limited choices---oops.? She  did tell me, 
however, that three girls have already selected dresses...(are we  already 
behind?) and she will speak briefly on dresses and registration and ask  for 
questions.
At Mondays patroness meeting (which was pretty non-newsy), I  gave all Jr. 
moms a ""heads-up""? that March meeting would be at dress  shop,or bridal shop, 
and that they would be invited, just for scheduling  purposes.
?
I have spoken with Barb Lindsey..a NCL member whose husband is  with Houston 
Police Dept.? He is realitivly cool, as far as a dad police  combo, but does 
have girl and boy twins in college, so he knows  teen-agers.? He is willing 
to talk to girls about what to do in case of  accident, when to leave your 
car, safety and so on...thought we could tie that  in with car maintenance 
meeting.
?
I will let you know as the Sunday plans progress, I am afraid  that this is 
going to be a ""catch-all"".? Know you are busy, no need to  respond, call 
Friday pm or Saturday if you have questions.

on Captiva Island.  

Sorry that I didn't have time to respond to your e:mail from last week.  It 
will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff.  Yes, the bed and 
changing table match -- maple with a small amount of blue (not bright) trim 
on the bed and maple only on the changing table.  Our bedding could probably 
go either way, boy or girl.  If I remember correctly, the bumpers are red 
ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue 
chambray and red bandana trim.  It's not as loud as it sounds - just take a 
look when you are here.  We also have a beautiful cradle (with bedding) for 
you to look at and a great baby swing.  As the baby gets older, we also have 
an entertainer - now takes the place of what we used to call walkers.  

I am mailing you a Martha Stewart magazine on babies (yes, she does those, 
too!), as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items 
in them.  

Yes, good news on Dad.  I hope that in the next few weeks that his medication 
will kick in and he will see some improvement.  It is highly likely that the 
infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had.  It is just 
great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started.  I think 
that he dodged a bullet on this one.  

We will look forward to seeing you and Chris for Thanksgiving.  No big plans 
yet.  I assume that everyone will be here by at least Wednesday night.  I 
have ordered a birthday cake from RJ Goodies to help celebrate all November 
birthdays that evening.  Am hoping that Mom and Dad may come over on Tuesday 
so that we can do some fun things on Wednesday during the day (always a great 
day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for Thanksgiving!).  I 
will have the whole week off from work.  The kids are off starting on 
Wednesday.  It is possible that on Friday, David, Amanda and Tyler may drive 
to Longview to have a visit with his mom and family.  If you can stay, we 
could really plan something fun if I an partially childless!!

Hello!   I'm off to the seashelling capital of the world . . .

Here's my travel itinerary should anyone need to reach me:

Going:
Wednesday, Nov. 8
Delta 1258 to Atlanta - leave 9:15 A.M.
Delta 1920 to Ft. Myers,  Florida
arrive florida 3:35 P.M.

Return:
Sunday, Nov. 12
Delta 1677 to Atlanta
Delta 4741 to Austin
arrive Austin 6:30 P.M.

Staying at Sanibel Harbour Resort & Spa in Ft. Myers, Fla

I won't have my cell phone with me, so if you need to reach me, leave a
message for me.   My roommate, should they not be able to locate my name, is
Laura Suarez.   We're all with the loud and overly-extroverted USTA group.

Should you need to reach Chris, call his work no. at 477-8787 and they will
be able to tell you how he can be reached in Singapore.    Wanna call Erica?
She's having her last hurrah at the farm - so I wouldn't disturb her if you
know what's good for you.

will only communicate Needs Improvement and Issues.  There will be differing 
messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need to hear 
that they are not performing at a high enough level relative to peers to help 
us achieve business goals or for them to considered for a bonus (may need to 
find another role within or outside excelr which is a better fit).  Message to 
someone new to excelr in that category should be different.  Glad they are

will be able to make significant contributions; doing the right thing to 
learn the business, but that contributions to date are not significant enough

Hi Patti,

This will probably be the first of many emails in the next couple of weeks.

Do you have a location as to where Beth will be sitting over there?  We'll be 
packing up her boxes soon to ship over and for future post etc.

Also, she will need a new extension number.  She would most definately prefer 
an 853 number and if you can use her VP status to help her get one if they 
refuse (her words) then that would be great.  Her old number was 853-5521 
although someone else may have that now.

Thank you for your help.  It is very much appreciated.

Per Catherine at Travel Agency in the Park, bulkhead seats were all that were

flights have gotten quite popular lately.  Only other option for return:

Same isle (E)
 - Row 8 (also bulkhead, but maybe not as noisy)
 - Last row window seat (doesn't recline as much as other seats)

If you like either of these better that existing seat, let me know & I change 
it.

As you know, I am approaching the end of my rotation in Texas Risk.  As I

leaning on your insight and advice.  I have gained valuable knowledge while

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

data gathered by Todd Burke.  We can process those agreed upon requests, but 
will not include those dollars within our merit totals.  That way, won't have

I think that four weeks is a good time frame for this - we can re-evaluate at 
the end of that period as to whether or not this is still needed.  As far as 
the right time, you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest 
(global products).  They can give you the best estimate on timing.  I am 
copying them on this memo. 

When your schedule is set, I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with 
a copy of the schedule (dates, names and contact numbers).  Please send me a 
copy as well.  This IT presence on the floor during critical calculation 
times will be very much appreciated.  I understand that not only will this 
provide immediate contact when and if system issues arise, but that your team 
will be working with the book administrators on improving spreadsheet 
macros.

Sally,

I am currently working on a plan for floor support to provide a better time 
coverage. I would like to hear your suggestion. I have been thinking of 
providing floor support till 8:00 p.m. every weekday for the next 4 weeks. Do 
you want us to extend the hours to later than 8:00 p.m. and longer than 4 
weeks?

I appreciate very much your comments.

Doorstep is a joint MRM RAC and Energy Ops review process.  If we want to 
include a full review of all the mtm methodologies we need to start building 
this into the doorsteps by ensuring that the RAC person attending the 
doorstep has the relevant experience to perform this review and that the time 
scheduled to do the review is adequate.

Subject: Doorstep and Risk Reviews


I am getting a strong sense that there are many holes, patches and 
workarounds in the upstream risk systems, relating to their ability to 
reflect accurately the valuation, and the risk attached to the products that 
get traded.

I would like to use the doorstep process and the risk review process to 
establish precisely what those holes are, if we don't already know. Here is 
an example:

 ""All of our systems value options at-the-money, regardless of moneyness."" 
True or False ?

Can you please include this concept in those exercises. The aim is, at least 
by the end of Q1 we can put our hands on a summary of everything.

Thanks

Dear Rick & Rick,

Encompassed in the Doorstep schedule given to you during our last meeting 
were scheduled reviews for London and Houston EES offices.  Do you consider 
EES and EBS to be groups that should be scoped into the Doorstep reviews?  
Since we have never addressed this specifically, I'd like to get your 
thoughts.

Thanks

will both be glad for her to return home.  I have mentioned to you before, 
Hector, that an excelr friend has dealt with a brain tumor successfully.  That 
is Barbara Gray, an attorney in ENA's Legal Department.  Barbara counsels 
patients and their families who are facing situations similar to hers.  If 
you feel like you would like to talk with someone who can understand on a 
more firsthand basis what you and Brenda are facing, I would encourage you to 
contact Barbara.  In addition to having been through her own battle with a 
brain tumor, she is simply a wonderful person whom I know you would enjoy 
meeting.  I have mentioned your situation to her, and she would certainly 
welcome a conversation with you.  

I will be in the London office next week, so we will have to coordinate on 
merit increases from there.  I will be back in the office on Monday, January

Subject: Update

I saw Brenda last night and she was doing very well.   We expect that she 
will remain in NICU until approx. this afternoon and it is hoped that she 
will be able to come home on Monday.   As Frank has probably already told 
you, the Surgeon could only remove 50% of the tumor.   He believes it was 
benign and we'll have confirmation today.   
Brenda will need several MRI's and Gamma Knife therapy (radiation) 
treatments.   We don't know the particular demands of this therapy but, we do 
look forward to having it provide a long term solution.   
I anticipate at this point that I will need to work from home or stay in 
touch from home on Monday and that I will be able to return to your good 
company on Tuesday.    I remain available and in touch via my cell phone, 
pager and e-mail.   Please don't hesitate to call.    Working with you is a 
welcome distraction. 
Thank you very much for you support and prayers.   I look forward to seeing 
you soon.

her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost. Either way, consider it

However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not

could be a problem on the 31st?  You never know with Houston weather.  What 
do you think?  We could do the tour and then go to Irma's Southwest Grill (2

Subject: Topics for next week

Well, I didn't get this out to you before I left the office last night.  I 
was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at 
that point.  Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:

 review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London 
books to same day, - certainly want to review this in detail with you - the 
issue being that we may not in the short/medium term be able to change 
systems infrastructure to run same day - but with a combination of process 
and tactical systems enhancements we may be able to deliver no action p&l, 
new activity p&l and position signoff on trade date with 'officialisation' of 
books on T+1 in time for RAC VAR explain and limit monitoring process

Also I would like to go through our credit difficulties with you and Ted at 
same time - more for information on this  - because when we 'solve' market 
risk reporting issues we will face big push to 'clean' credit exposure 
reporting process - Office of Chair is very insistent on this

 to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for 
London counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are 
doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) 
Would defintely welcome this - I can walk through the European MO issues 
trying to identify key operational risk themes - top of my list is Metals

I would like to spend some time on Metals with you - hence the lunch on 
Wednesday with Andy Cornfield and Howard Carter the two controllers for 
Metals ( Brokerage and Merchanting ) - the starting place for this will be 
the presentation I gave to Rick Causey in early December.

 discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your 
business controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep 
reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to 
continually improve the process), 
Would like to brainstorm the linkage between control standards reporting, 
self assessment of Op risk and doorstep - this can be done initially in a 
small group but additionally I believe the business controllers would welcome 
some more background of why Rick,Rick and yourself need the process to be 
successful - I think they understand ( I have fully promoted it ) but your 
'asides' explaining the weight Jeff assigns to it are very powerful motivators

 discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office 
related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPR
As explained above - additionally I would like to walk you through the 
implementation of our change management structure which attempts to cross 
prioritise all IT development efforts - a meeting with Steve Whitaker, Mark 
and Fernley on this would be useful

 do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE - certainly in 
calendar and signed off by the executive committee of one ( my wife !!! )

 discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London 
 - can you let me know some more of this - I am uncertain of it

 discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around 
potential commercialization of  mid and back office services - The below is a 
section of an objective I am asking my settlements director to follow - I 
would like to expand on these and other thoughts - particularly the absence 
of vision/strategy documentation for CL

Lead on all CommodityLogic initiatives associated with Settlements ( note 
this is my definition of what CL should be doing ) including :-
Changing Market practices
create cashflow messaging within each transaction
create payment advice notification for each transaction at inception and 
liquidation 
re-evaluate operational cost structure associated with any possible changes 
to terms of trade
Module/Application developments
Synergy from internal process changes ( pulling Settlements and Documentation 
together )
elimination of paper/fax confirmation processes if we can utilise electronic 
messaging of cashflow details within transactions and electronic messaging of 
payment advices at inception ( based upon planned trade settlement  ) and at 
liquidation ( based upon actual trade settlement )

 
In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you 
think would be beneficial.  Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael 
Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.  I will also 
spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.  And I plan 
to meet with Fernley as well.  

Any other suggestions on topics or people to see?  Can I suggest we also 
cover 
Remote offices with Naomi Connell
The ledger control process - similarities and differences with Houston
Static reference control processes - ( Global 
Counterparties/Companies/Contracts/Facilities etc )
Themes from our business process reengineering reviews prior to Christmas - 
similar to bottom up Op risk assessment
A gap analysis for the risk management team - explaining the 'legacy' work 
that James New has been leading on 
Our plans for EAS in Europe 

I shall call to discuss / prioritise and then I can instruct Fiona to 
organise meetings

Mike

  
I think that we have lunch already on the calendar for Wednesday - as above 
but would you also be available for dinner with the controllers and Fernley ?

Frank and I are staying at the Sheraton Belgravia which is about a 5 minute 
walk to our office  -- it is small and quiet but nice rooms.  It is not on a 
major street like Picadilly or Park Lane, but we like it.  The rate is about 
o190 a night

We had to move out of our flat on Monday, so are staying there until we 
leave.  Right now we are scheduled to fly out on Sat the 20th.

Also --- just a few notes on next week

I am free Monday night if you would like to have dinner.  I know Frank and 
Maureen will be in Spain that night, they are back on Tuesday  

Also my going away party that Fernley is throwing is on Wed night -- so 
hopefully most people will drop by there.  It is just a pub thing near the 
office, but hopefully you can make it!  I am sure there will be dinner or 
something afterwards.  

Talk to you soon

Subject: Visit to London

I hope that your holidays were wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the week of 
vacation that I took before Christmas.  It was fun to be home with the 
children, although I certainly worked hard -- up every night until very late 
either baking or wrapping gifts or writing notes on last minute Christmas 
cards.  

I plan to be in the London office next week.  I will leave Houston on Sunday 
evening and will arrive in London Monday morning.  After a stop by the hotel, 
I should be in the office after lunch.  I plan to be there through Thursday, 
and will fly back to Houston on Friday morning.  

I have a number of things planned to review with Mike Jordan.  Some of the 
major goals for the trip are:

 to review Mike Jordan's action plan to move the close and officialization of 
London books to same  day,

 to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts 
(we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 for managers and above within 
Operations for EA, EGM and EIM),

 to discuss the Doorstep process with Mike's business controllers in the 
London office who will participate in  Doorstep reviews this year, 

 to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London 
office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR

I also plan to visit with Mike on the feasibility of utilizing our 
operational pricing model in London and his thoughts on CommodityLogic and 
other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office 
services.  Mike also has some members of the London team that he would like 
for me to meet.  

Other things planned are spending some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy.  
Ted and I will have a conference call with Shona and Cassandra (and team) for 
a download on the New York metals Doorstep review that is taking place this 
week.  

I would welcome your participation in any or all of the above.  In addition, 
I hope that you may have some time for the two of us to touch base.  Also, if 
you have an opening for lunch or dinner, do let me know.  I have been in the 
throws of bonus allocations this week, but hope that today I can start to 
finalize my calendar for next week.  --Sally

Subject: Debt Trading Losses

Bryan,
I think the second bullet is misleading.  The bullet is not reflective of 
what is actually stated in the attached document.
There is a month-end price verification process on the Credit book.  
Trader pricing is compared to prime broker pricing.  Where the mark is 
greater that 2 points, the difference is discussed with the trader.  Trader 
must then amend the mark or provide third party substantiation for the 
illiquid position.
The Price Verifiaction Comparison Spreadsheet with broker quotes is filed and 
maintained by Risk Management.

The Operations break-down in the process relates to:
 Triplets excluded from the monthly price verification process and not 
escalated, prioritized to management
 Telewest  pricing relied on a price from the prime broker which was manually 
sourced and not current
 Price Verification Comparison results should be formalized and distributed 
to senior management.

Thanks. Sheila

Subject: Debt Trading Losses


We have discovered two positions in the Debt Trading book which were not 
being marked to market. The current mark of the 2 positions results in 
approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :



The primary control issues are:
? Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had 
not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)

The losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by 
Operations.  The trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will 
implement the steps agreed with Operations to ensure that we have a robust 
approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.

Chris Hanz has blocked his entire day out today for technology recruiting - 
therefore he said that he would be able to meet with John from 1:30 - 2:00 
just before a recruiting event for office visits at 2:00.  Therefore, Lexi is 
going to bring and pick up both Chris Hoyle and John Rodgers as indicated 
below:

Chris Hoyle  EB1812  11:00 a.m. - 11:30 a.m.
John Rodgers  EB1812  1:30 p.m. - 2:00 p.m.

I have arranged for Chris Hoyle to meet with Chris Hanz, Sr. Director

Chris to the 18th floor and pick him up at 11:30.  I am still trying to

Subject: 2001 Group Expenses

Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.

Thanks for your task force summary.

Should we not be looking to get more detail of exactly the reasons were 
especially for human errors and highlight those areas where the problems 
arise rather than grouping things together and in so doing losing the detail 
? Also we should try to get some trend information so that it is clear where

I am not quite there I am afraid. Are you saying that the folks outside NY 
and London have no autonomy and are merely acting on trading instructions 
issued by the London or NY trading desks ? If that is the case:

Why don't NY and London do the deals themselves and let the locals 
concentrate on generating business ?
There should be no ""Chicago Book"" (SCRP) for example
That conflicts with the ""envelope"" which you mention, which appears to be a 
delegated trading authority, in which case we are back to ""square one"" it 
would appear.

Help me out.

The set-up for the financial trading is similiar except that the instructions 
are relaid by e-mail each night to New York and Tokyo.  Tim Pateman 
(authorised trader in London) sends details of positions and instructions on 
prices / volumes. 

The mail provide directions on pricing (off set basis on EOL) and volumes, 
creating an envelope in which they can trade.
They  must call for further instructions if the price shifts by more than $10 
($100 for Tin & Nickel)  or the position by more than 100 lots.

David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says ""internally"" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Regards,
Tim

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says ""done"" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

excelr places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

As you know, HPL is a gas utility subject to Texas Railroad Commission 
(""RRC"") jurisdiction, and as such HPL must comply with relevant statutes and 
regulations.  Two RRC regulatory reporting matters in which I have been 
involved are HPL's Gas Utility General Annual Report and tariffs.  I have 
concluded that the way in which these filings are accomplished, and 
particularly the information systems used in the processes, should be 
reviewed.  Mike Eiben and Bob Hall have also been involved in this process 
(although Bob came in only recently) and are much more familiar with the

and ""gut reaction"" is preferable to consensus and prosecutable evidence,  I 
feel so strongly about this that I would consider removing my team from 
involvement if politically correct, grammatically sound and properly 
researched reports that do not say anything or are stale or are full of

I am not quite there I am afraid. Are you saying that the folks outside NY 
and London have no autonomy and are merely acting on trading instructions 
issued by the London or NY trading desks ? If that is the case:

Why don't NY and London do the deals themselves and let the locals 
concentrate on generating business ?
There should be no ""Chicago Book"" (SCRP) for example
That conflicts with the ""envelope"" which you mention, which appears to be a 
delegated trading authority, in which case we are back to ""square one"" it 
would appear.

The set-up for the financial trading is similiar except that the instructions 
are relaid by e-mail each night to New York and Tokyo.  Tim Pateman 
(authorised trader in London) sends details of positions and instructions on 
prices / volumes. 

The mail provide directions on pricing (off set basis on EOL) and volumes, 
creating an envelope in which they can trade.
They  must call for further instructions if the price shifts by more than $10 
($100 for Tin & Nickel)  or the position by more than 100 lots.

David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says ""internally"" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Regards,
Tim

How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says ""done"" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

excelr places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

=09=09 Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

excelr WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming excelr Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
excelr=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

excelr Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include excelr=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) excelr Global Assets.  In addition, excelr=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of excelr Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of excelr Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of excelr APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of excelr Global Assets. excelr Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of excelr=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of excelr APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of excelr India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
excelr=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into excelr Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of excelr Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of excelr Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

excelr Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of excelr Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

excelr Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to excelr Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating excelr=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, excelr Americas.  excelr Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for excelr=20
Americas.

excelr Europe
The excelr Europe organization, which includes excelr=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and excelr Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

excelr Global Markets
excelr Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for excelr=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
excelr Global Assets.  excelr Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

excelr Industrial Markets
excelr Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of excelr Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=

European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other excelr businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
excelr Net Works, and excelr Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for excelr Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for excelr Global Markets and excelr Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for excelr Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=

AND excelr WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by excelr=01,s=

The set-up for the financial trading is similiar except that the instructions 
are relaid by e-mail each night to New York and Tokyo.  Tim Pateman 
(authorised trader in London) sends details of positions and instructions on 
prices / volumes. 

The mail provide directions on pricing (off set basis on EOL) and volumes, 
creating an envelope in which they can trade.
They  must call for further instructions if the price shifts by more than $10 
($100 for Tin & Nickel)  or the position by more than 100 lots.

David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says ""internally"" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Regards,
Tim

Pls do the following asap:

 Introduce yourself to John and make sure he knows the most expeditiious ways 
to get information regarding the content of the DPR and Executive Reports.
 Pls consider this request.  I think it is a good idea to either put comments

report that could give more detail.

FYI, Shona works in Sally Beck's Global Operations group and (among 5,000

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

excelr places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says ""done"" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales

s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

excelr WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming excelr Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
excelr=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

excelr Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include excelr=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) excelr Global Assets.  In addition, excelr=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of excelr Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of excelr Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of excelr APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of excelr Global Assets. excelr Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of excelr=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of excelr APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of excelr India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
excelr=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into excelr Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of excelr Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of excelr Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

excelr Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of excelr Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

excelr Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to excelr Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating excelr=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, excelr Americas.  excelr Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for excelr=20
Americas.

excelr Europe
The excelr Europe organization, which includes excelr=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and excelr Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

excelr Global Markets
excelr Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for excelr=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
excelr Global Assets.  excelr Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

excelr Industrial Markets
excelr Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of excelr Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other excelr businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
excelr Net Works, and excelr Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for excelr Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for excelr Global Markets and excelr Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for excelr Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

excelr GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND excelr WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=

EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by excelr=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across excelr=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the excelr Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20

Dear John,

The following are the amounts that make up the $5.8 mil.  I have looked into 
your query and noted that there was a late adjustment not exported to us (so 
not captured in the DPR).  The adjustment will be reflected in today's DPR.

Please call me at 713 408 4315 if you have any questions.



Best regards

 Shona

Shona,
Pls do the following asap:

 Introduce yourself to John and make sure he knows the most expeditiious ways 
to get information regarding the content of the DPR and Executive Reports.
 Pls consider this request.  I think it is a good idea to either put comments 
on the Corp DPR or each business unit should have their own summary executive 
report that could give more detail.

John,
FYI, Shona works in Sally Beck's Global Operations group and (among 5,000 
other things) is in charge of the group that puts together the DPR.
Cassandra Schultz, who is also copied here, is a VP who works for me in 
charge of Policy issues and works closely with Shona.

My first day physicallyt at excelr House is planned for 1/8/01.

Our DPR shows a $5.8 million loss in other for the day.  Can we add notes 
onto this report so we can see what is happening here - I am not
sure what this is.

Thanks!

How odd ? I came away with the impression that:

we would look at the outgoing commercial instructions to see whether they 
support the activity of the guys in Chicago with phones in their hands, and 
are in themselves wholly appropriate;
we would address the issue of not having taped lines;
we would address the issue of segregation of duties in the office, other than 
in Powerpoint
we would get to the bottom of the difference between the AS400 and ""Local 
Access Database""
we would see a business model that defines how the office functions as an 
""origination only"" office
we would see a revised timeline for the resolution of the other issues in the 
review

Subject: Doorstep meeting

Shona

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the 
transparency and accountability of issues raised. 

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient' 
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin 
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the 
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from 
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get 
an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we 
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a 
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their 
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down 

Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns 
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems 
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues
Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate 
that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date. 
Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict 
systematically with the above instructions
All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls 
exist and function in NY
Marcelo / Me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business 
communications on roles and responsibilities
Myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and 
monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens

Will call later

Mike

Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

excelr WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming excelr Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
excelr=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

excelr Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include excelr=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) excelr Global Assets.  In addition, excelr=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of excelr Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of excelr Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of excelr APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of excelr Global Assets. excelr Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of excelr=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of excelr APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of excelr India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
excelr=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into excelr Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of excelr South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of excelr Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of excelr Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

excelr Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of excelr Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

excelr Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to excelr Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating excelr=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, excelr Americas.  excelr Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for excelr=20
Americas.

excelr Europe
The excelr Europe organization, which includes excelr=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and excelr Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

excelr Global Markets
excelr Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for excelr=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
excelr Global Assets.  excelr Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

excelr Industrial Markets
excelr Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of excelr Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other excelr businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
excelr Net Works, and excelr Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for excelr Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for excelr Global Markets and excelr Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=

to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=

First of all....I hope you are feeling well...with all of the emails going 
back and forth I haven't taken the time to say so...

I just spoke with Lou Santorie with Sempra.  He said that they are very 
interested in Confirm Corp and would be looking for a company to partner 
with.  He said that basically ""if excelr would decide to use this application"" 
that the industry would have to get on board...basically sounds like he feels 
that we would set the stage for what is used in the industry as far a 
clearing applications.

We had a brainstorming meeting with the Commodity Logic team at 
lunch....their concepts are good for Phase I but we would get the biggest 
bang from their later Phase concept where they intend to do the automatching 
of deal info. between us and the Counterparty......

we are proposing on CL.  One question I'm exploring right now is whether we 
could save more money from an excelr perspective and achieve greater 
marketability with the model that ConfirmCorp proposes with automated 
matching vs. the Commodity Logic/Williams approach that depends on users 
reviewing/approving confirms (we've simply put the current process online so 
to speak).  We need to push for a more radical change/improvement on a faster 
timeline.   I still believe confirms is the correct area to be focusing on, 
as I mentioned in our meeting with Louise, but we need to seriously review 
what we propose to deliver and how.  Is ConfirmCorp a viable company to bring 
under the excelr umbrella?

I think we should be concerned that late entry with less functionality will 
erode our ability to sign up customers.  I don't think each large marketer 
will want to log in to several sites to clear their confirmations with each 
of their large counterparties.

Can we find out if Williams has further plans for their service that would 
compete with Commodity Logic?

Dear Ron:

I recently sent you information relating to ConfirmCorp via FedEx.  I trust 
you have received it by now.  If you have any questions, please do not 
hesitant to call.  I will follow up with you in one week.

Regards,

Chris Papousek
President, Confirmation Clearing Corporation
(713)526-3000

PS Williams Energy just came out with ""Williams CustomerFirst"", a website 
that contains all their confirmations.  While eliminating faxes, this puts 
the onus of verification on the counterparty and assumes there is a 
confirmation staff on the other end to do the checkout.  ConfirmCorp will 
make even this advanced approach obsolete.

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the 
transparency and accountability of issues raised. 

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient' 
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin 
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the 
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from 
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get 
an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we 
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a 
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their 
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down 

Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns 
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems 
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues
Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate 
that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date. 
Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict 
systematically with the above instructions
All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls 
exist and function in NY
Marcelo / Me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business 
communications on roles and responsibilities
Myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and 
monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens

Subject: Clearing User Meetings

I have attached the e-mail that Ron Nolte sent to the Deal Clearing user 
community regarding the meeting
that is scheduled for November 16-17.   Please note that this is a meeting 
organized by the IT community, not
the user community.

As you may remember, Stephen Schwarz organized a similar meeting last fall in 
order to provide the IT group
with an agenda of what projects the user community considered to be priority 
projects.  However, the arrival of
EOL greatly altered the IT resources available to concentrate on those 
priority projects.  Today, the deal 
clearing community is struggling to get IT resources due to new systems such 
as ClickPaper.com, Commodity
Logic, project Thunderball  and a new weather capture and confirmation 
system.  This has created some internal 
conflict since each user group supported by the IT deal clearing applications 
group is requesting that their projects 
be set as the top priority project.  

This is a quick outline of the challenges facing both the deal clearing user 
community and the IT group supporting
this group.  I would be happy to discuss any questions you have about either 
the meeting or these challenges.

on Captiva Island.  

Sorry that I didn't have time to respond to your e:mail from last week.  It 
will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff.  Yes, the bed and 
changing table match -- maple with a small amount of blue (not bright) trim 
on the bed and maple only on the changing table.  Our bedding could probably 
go either way, boy or girl.  If I remember correctly, the bumpers are red 
ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue 
chambray and red bandana trim.  It's not as loud as it sounds - just take a 
look when you are here.  We also have a beautiful cradle (with bedding) for 
you to look at and a great baby swing.  As the baby gets older, we also have 
an entertainer - now takes the place of what we used to call walkers.  

I am mailing you a Martha Stewart magazine on babies (yes, she does those, 
too!), as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items 
in them.  

Yes, good news on Dad.  I hope that in the next few weeks that his medication 
will kick in and he will see some improvement.  It is highly likely that the 
infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had.  It is just 
great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started.  I think 
that he dodged a bullet on this one.  

We will look forward to seeing you and Chris for Thanksgiving.  No big plans 
yet.  I assume that everyone will be here by at least Wednesday night.  I 
have ordered a birthday cake from RJ Goodies to help celebrate all November 
birthdays that evening.  Am hoping that Mom and Dad may come over on Tuesday 
so that we can do some fun things on Wednesday during the day (always a great 
day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for Thanksgiving!).  I 
will have the whole week off from work.  The kids are off starting on 
Wednesday.  It is possible that on Friday, David, Amanda and Tyler may drive 
to Longview to have a visit with his mom and family.  If you can stay, we 
could really plan something fun if I an partially childless!!

Delta 1920 to Ft. Myers,  Florida
arrive florida 3:35 P.M.

I won't have my cell phone with me, so if you need to reach me, leave a
message for me.   My roommate, should they not be able to locate my name, is
Laura Suarez.   We're all with the loud and overly-extroverted USTA group.

Should you need to reach Chris, call his work no. at 477-8787 and they will
be able to tell you how he can be reached in Singapore.    Wanna call Erica?
She's having her last hurrah at the farm - so I wouldn't disturb her if you

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

support and cooperation during this integration phase.  Clearly more work 
needs to be done but the major risk and control issues have been addressed.

Subject: Re: Chicago Doorstep Review  

Thanks for the update - as you say, hopefully this summary covers all the 
issues. Shona?

Point #2 comes up in Doorstep after Doorstep. It was discussed extensively 
upon being raised in the Singapore Doorstep and Andy Cowx (Telecoms expert 
for excelr Europe) researched potential solutions without success. I can't 
help but feel that as this is a global issue, a global solution/answer needs 
to be found. Shona - can you take this up with either Sally or Ted and find 
someone accountable for coming up with a global answer.

Point #4 per the updated list of Authorised Traders and follow up note to Sam 
Hainsworth defining scope of what Chicago and Montreal may/may not do, any 
residual position that Chicago may ""create"" is pre-authorised by Sam and is 
an integral part of his global book. I have forwarded the follow up note to 
Shona this morning, and confirmed with Sam that he has communicated the 
contents with his staff in those offices, i.e. no local limits, however 
small, are required!

Point #5 Lou's list of AS400 development needs has been prioritised and 
depending on where on this list the improvements to customer reports are, 
this should be done in the very near future.

Point #10 we considered preserving the Helsinki typewriter in perspex, as a 
reminder to us all, however I am assured it has now been destroyed. Suggest 
that once the forms have been converted, this machine is rendered useless, 
e.g. remove the ""e"" key or take a spanner to it!

Per the point you make about the timing of moving the scrap business - I will 
assume that the timing is acceptable to Houston unless we hear concerns to 
the contrary.

Thanks and regards,
Tim

Subject: Chicago Doorstep Review

Please find Derek's report on the visit by the Houston Risk/Controlling 
team.  Assuming that this summary covered all the issues, it seems that we 
are making progress.
  
Point # 1 - The problem with the phones will be addressed when they move to 
the other excelr office.  I agree that the sooner the move takes place the 
better but let's make sure that they are properly set up in the new office 
prior to their move.  The critical part of the move is to assure that 
availability to the AS400 is established, prior to the move.
Point #2 - Using cell phones needs to be addressed.  How are you controlling 
this in London and other offices?
Once we transfer the Scrap business to London (Jan. 2000) we will not have 
position issues in Chicago.  Until that time comes please note that Chicago 
has been instructed not to take any positions.  In the event of an unbalanced 
book, with an agreement from Sam, they will need a small limit..  Tim, Can 
you formalize this with Sam (see point 4 below) for good order sake?
Point # 5 - We need a better customer exposure report from the AS400.  Mike 
Sweeny should  help us on this front.
Point # 10 - ""Russia/Bills of Lading/Typewriter""  - Helsinki is still fresh 
in our minds.  What can I say.  I told them to unplug the machine.
Point # 11- Stephanie reporting to Lou is not a problem.  Derek doing 
logistics and assisting the traders is not a problem since we have taken away 
all the middle office functions from his control.

Please let me know if you hear anything different.

		 Subject: Chicago Doorstep Review

Following is a recap of issues Bob & I discussed yesterday with
Shona Wilson, David Port & Bjorn Hagelmann:

1- We explained how all confirms/pricings/invoices were now sent
directly to counterparties from NY, not Chicago.

2- David Port was very concerned that we were not using taped phones yet
and will push this issue upon return to Houston as reason for us to move
to ENA before Thanksgiving, perhaps as early as next weekend.

3- Discussed problems with confirming business when out of the office (on home
phones, cell phones or external meetings):
a)  Conversations not taped -- suggested that a conference call be made to
a taped line at our office to record the transaction, or that someone from the
office call the counterparty directly to confirm the contract.
b)  They were concerned about fixing prices without a screen.  We explained 
that
mostly we only fix premiums/discounts for later pricing.  When fixing a 
price, the
trader would either call the office or LME broker for a live quote and for 
hedging.

4- We explained that we do not have formal position limits because our book
is more or less fully hedged (as per JR's memo).  David asked if we had any
'informal' limits, to which we suggested +/- 500 MT due to buying & selling 
through
the course of the day, but unhedged positions, if any, would not be left open
unless discussed with & approved by Sam.

5- We agreed that credit functions & reporting should be strengthened, 
especially
to show total exposures by customers, not just limits or receivables.

6- Shona will follow up with Alan Aronowitz to finalize GTCs/Master 
Agreements ASAP.

7- Shona asked about progress with agency agreements.  Lou - please add this 
to
your action plan with Naomi Connell in London as responsible party.

8- Showed them our daily positions & AS400 positions which they agreed were in
good order.  Explained that NY reconciles positions daily and Chicago balances
AS400 vs. daily position periodically as needed.

9- They asked how we track overshipments and undershipments.  Showed them how
traffic dept. uses Access system to highlight late/over/undershipments which 
are
brought to trader for action.  Showed comparable reports in AS400 showing 
late shipments
and undershipments, but explained that overshipments were automatically 
zeroed out by AS400.
I will discuss this further with Sweeney to formalize reporting of 
overshipments for
tracking of position changes & contract overages.

10- Bjorn was very concerned that we use a typewriter to fill out certain 
forms -- most
notably excelr's 5-part carbon-paper insurance certs.  (Apparently Helskinki 
problem
involved using a typewriter to alter Bills of Lading.)  Bjorn will discuss 
with excelr insurance
dept. possibility of converting to electronic forms.

11- They suggested that Stephanie should report directly to Lou instead of 
DVD in order to
maintain front/middle office separation.  Also that DVD should be either 
trading or logistics/ 
administration, not a combination of both (Helsinki again).

12- Showed them daily P&L and trader sign-off procedure.

Subject: NOV. 4TH SUPER SATURDAY INTERVIEWS

I am a recruiting co-ordinator with the Associate and Analyst Programs.  We 
are looking for additional offices within which to conduct interviews this 
Saturday, November 4th.  We are bringing in over 80 candidates and are in 
need of interview rooms.  Many of excelr's Executives and VPs recognize the 
importance of the success of this event and have lent their offices to us for 
these interviews.  However, many more offices are needed.  The interview 
process begins at approximately 9:00 a.m. and will conclude by 1:00 p.m. that 
Saturday.  If you are concerned about the sensitive nature of some of the 
materials in your office, we ask that you simply move the confidential 
documents to one side of your desk and/or credenza.  We will see that the 
materials are turned ""face down"" or covered with a blank piece of paper so as

Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:




As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

changes are anticipated.  Note:  these are subject to change given market 
volatility.

EES - $2MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00  ------------------------> 
EXTENDED THROUGH 1/5/01

Aggregate VaR Limit of $140MM - $40MM expiring on 12/22/00 ----------> 
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 - reduced to permanent Aggregate VaR Limit of $100MM

NA Gas - $35MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ------------------> 
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 (with reduction in Aggregate VaR Limit to $100MM)

UK Power - $5MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ----------------> 
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 (with reduction in Aggregate VaR Limit to $100MM)

NA Gas - $15MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 -----------------> 
EXTEND $10MM THROUGH 1/5/01

       -----------------> REALLOCATE $5MM to UK Power THROUGH 1/5/01.



Therefore, the following VaR limits are/will be in place:

EES    $7MM   $7MM  $5MM

NA Gas    $110MM  $70MM  $60MM

UK Power   $20.3MM  $20.3MM $15.3MM

Aggregate VaR Limit  $140MM  $100MM $83MM



Vlady/Frank - Ted told Lavorato the NA Gas information on Friday.

Vlady/Minal - nothing to my knowledge has been communicated to EES yet.  You 
can check with Ted to see if he did already.

Oliver, please communicate the anticipated limit changes for UK Power to the 
commercial and risk management/energy ops people who need to know.  If an 
extension is needed in the Discretionary VaR, at this point an analysis and 
presentation will be required to justify the extension to get Rick Buy and 
Ted Murphy to approve.

can be reached at home or on my cell phone.

Dear Shona,

Actually, I am waiting on the deal test samples from Leslie (if this is still 
the game plan) before giving Jennifer the total package, which Jennifer 
understands.  She followed up with a call requesting a summary of findings in 
lieu of the working papers, at least for now.  She is calling me everyday, 
and I think it would be good to bring closure to this.  I have not heard 
anything from Leslie.  If you and Leslie are happy with the remainder of the 
deal test, I will x-ref the working papers as such, and we can ship the 
papers on to Jennifer.

Thanks, Shona!

UAT on phase 1 of this application development has identified previously 
unforeseen technical and functional requirements/issues. Consequently, a 
comprehensive re-specification and re-planning exercise for DTL has been 
completed such as to give a much later implementation timetable.

Given the immediate, and absolute, need to implement the more significant of 
the control and efficiency improvements identified in this project along with 
the competing demands for existing IT development resource we have decided to 
:-

pause development work on the DTL application ( specifically )
apply business analysis resources on the full redesign and documentation of 
ledger control and reporting processes
complete the process changes within the Trade Accounting area that have been 
on-going for the last 6 months
reassign IT resources to the Enlighten and Envoice projects
reassess the timetable for the delivery of the residual DTL control and 
efficiency improvements by re-preforming the business case for the DTL 
application following the completion of the above identified work

Please feel free to discuss any of the above issues with us

At the meeting I was told 2 weeks to a month out.  I think they would like to 
start earlier and probably came over here with that intention, but they still 
have some legal, tax and obviously back office things to sort out (so 
basically as soon as commercially possible!).

They flew back to Houston today, so I expect to hear more details in a couple 
of days (after they chase down some legal and tax issues).  In the meantime, 
we need to get with Brenda and her group to sort out the back office details 
as soon as possible.  As you know, Global Products is currently only 
supporting 10-15 financial trades per month (confirms and settlements through 
ECTRIC).

Thanks for the call.  Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM. 
(Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both 
direct reports of mine.)  Brenda is out of the country through the end of 
this week on vacation, touring Europe with her mom.  If there is a need to 
address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road 
until Brenda returns.  Let me know. 

I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to 
go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true.   
If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so 
this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We 
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.  
Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you 
have heard anything on this.

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

Subject: DPR Summary

Shona,

Just to summarise the main thrust of our discussion yesterday:

Preliminary P/L due @ 1PM Local (7pm Houston)

As I understand, Sally is the sponsor of this project with the goal of 
presenting Skilling with a DPR by 8a.m. the following day.
I have asked all mgmrs to assess how we can achieve this.  We will discuss 
this in meeting early next week. 
A major obstacle that we face, is limited IT resource to re-engineer and 
expedite our processes.  This will require buy in of senior mgmt and 
commercial business heads to reallocate resources away from current projects. 
(James to discuss.)
Additionally, there are certain dependencies on depts in Houston, which are 
prerequisite for DPR completion in London. Notably Continental Power has a 
dependency on Portcalc IT support in Houston.  
Shift work and 16 hour days are more difficult (not impossible) to implement 
in London as the labour market is very tight and such working conditions 
would make excelr very uncompetitive as a prospective employer.  Bear in mind 
that we compete directly with all the big investment houses for the best 
talent.  A decision to use shift's would have to be made at the highest level 
considering the possible implications on the corporate image.  This might 
suggest that additional IT resource is the only feasible way forward.

I could easily say that we can do the preliminary p/l but I assume that we 
wish to retain the qualatitive features of our reporting.  Therefore I have 
tempered my comments to reflect what I believe are real issues that we in 
London will have to address.   We will get back to you with our proposals., 
after we have discussed these issues early next week.

Same day DPR

This is the long term goal and is such a large project that it would have to 
be sponsored at the highest level here in Europe.

Subject: Upcoming Discretionary VaR Limit Changes

Per discussion with Ted Murphy and Rick Buy, the following policy limit 
changes are anticipated.  Note:  these are subject to change given market 
volatility.

EES - $2MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00  ------------------------> 
EXTENDED THROUGH 1/5/01

Aggregate VaR Limit of $140MM - $40MM expiring on 12/22/00 ----------> 
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 - reduced to permanent Aggregate VaR Limit of $100MM

NA Gas - $35MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ------------------> 
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 (with reduction in Aggregate VaR Limit to $100MM)

UK Power - $5MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ----------------> 
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 (with reduction in Aggregate VaR Limit to $100MM)

NA Gas - $15MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 -----------------> 
EXTEND $10MM THROUGH 1/5/01

       -----------------> REALLOCATE $5MM to UK Power THROUGH 1/5/01.



Therefore, the following VaR limits are/will be in place:


   now - 12/22/00  12/23/00 - 1/5/01 1/6/01
EES    $7MM   $7MM  $5MM

NA Gas    $110MM  $70MM  $60MM

UK Power   $20.3MM  $20.3MM $15.3MM

Aggregate VaR Limit  $140MM  $100MM $83MM



Vlady/Frank - Ted told Lavorato the NA Gas information on Friday.

Vlady/Minal - nothing to my knowledge has been communicated to EES yet.  You 
can check with Ted to see if he did already.

Oliver, please communicate the anticipated limit changes for UK Power to the 
commercial and risk management/energy ops people who need to know.  If an 
extension is needed in the Discretionary VaR, at this point an analysis and 
presentation will be required to justify the extension to get Rick Buy and 
Ted Murphy to approve.

Feel free to call me with any questions.  I'm out on vacation this week, but 
can be reached at home or on my cell phone.

Happy Holidays,
Cassandra.

At the meeting I was told 2 weeks to a month out.  I think they would like to 
start earlier and probably came over here with that intention, but they still 
have some legal, tax and obviously back office things to sort out (so 
basically as soon as commercially possible!).

They flew back to Houston today, so I expect to hear more details in a couple 
of days (after they chase down some legal and tax issues).  In the meantime, 
we need to get with Brenda and her group to sort out the back office details 
as soon as possible.  As you know, Global Products is currently only 
supporting 10-15 financial trades per month (confirms and settlements through

Subject: Re: Livelink  

Ryan, thank you for your timely response.   It is a concern of mine that our 
current test sytems does not represent the current production system.  I feel 
we run a large risk by not adequately testing a product and all associated 
processes prior to moving it into production.  My concerns are based on the 
following: 

The volume of data that ENA puts into the Livelink system daily, and 
ultimately into iRIMS, exceeds any load testing that OpenText has done. 
 Due to our volume, without testing it is unknown if the performance will be 
adequate.  
There is an inherent risk to putting such a heavy volume application into 
production without proper load testing.
Being the test database server is not the same as the production database 
server, how will we ever know if the application will work?  More so, how 
will we be able to test the restore procedures?
iRIMS testing will include custom modules for iRIMS/Livelink migration.  This 
will require testing of ""adding classifications"" to  massive amounts of 
LiveLink folders.  The current volume is somewhere around 500,000 folders.  
It is my understanding the current test system can not handle this volume.  
The implementation of iRIMS effects the Livelink repository which needs to be 
tested as well.  There is some concern as to; can the current test system 
accommodate this.  

The question of having another Unix 4500 which will give us an identical test 
database or something smaller that might accomplish the same end result is 
one I can not answer.  However,  I would look to you and your technical team 
for recommendations in this matter and would agree to serving on the 
evaluation team.

If you have any questions please feel free to call me at 58841 and as usual, 
thank you for your help and support on this project.

Regards,


Joel

Hi Joel,
 The project plan at this point is very preliminary.  There will be a revised 
(more accurate) plan by the end of next week when OTPS and EDMS have time to 
meet with Carolyn and Barbara.  This is scheduled for next Wed.

This is complete;
Server for iRIMS Beta 9.0 is at Ardmore
iRIMS Test has been created (Oracle)
Test Data from EDMS Test is being copied at this time


Do you want me to purchase another Unix 4500 for Livelink (300K) that will 
give us an identical test database or should I look at getting a smaller less 
expensive Unix box?  Please inform and I will move ahead.

Thanks in advance,

As all of you know we are in the midst of the Fall recruitment process for 
the Analyst and Associate Program - the Super Saturday process.  A major part 
of the process is the Saturday interview which has been changed this year.  
Interviewers now only review five candidates and the ""offer "" decision is now 
completed on the same day as the interview.  This decision process is 
facilitated by a member of excelr's executive committee and should be 
completed by 3:30 pm.  ENA is one of the major users of the Analyst and 
Associate pool and needs to be well represented at Super Saturday (which we 
are not at this time).  The Program still needs additional interviewers and 
the Office of the Chairman of ENA needs you to support the Program and the 
interview process.  Signing up is now easier than ever and all you need to do 
is access the following web site and fill in a few blanks.  The web site is 
as follows:  http://axis.excelr.com/notice/ssinvite.asp.  The dates of Super 
Saturday's are listed below:

     October 28   November 4
     November 11   November 18
     December 2   December 9

dates.  Please respond accordingly.

All;

As I mentioned this morning at Cindy's HR Leadership meeting, we plan to 
delete the mid-year 2000 feedback from our system on 17 November 2000.  Would 
you kindly communicate this to your clients, to ensure that any outstanding 
final evaluations for mid-year 2000 are completed before that date.  

Supervisors who may need to obtain consolidated feedback on their employees 
or  to obtain final evaluation forms may call the Houston PEP Help Desk on  
(713) 853-4777 (option 4) or via e-mail to PEP Help Desk employee Vincent 
Cassata  (vincent.cassata@excelr.com).  

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me on

lately since volumes in Mexico are really picking up....
I am sending you the list of pending To Dos with our counterparties in 
Mexico...Hopefully with your help, we can start shrinking this list...
Thanks also for your time yesterday, and I think it was great to put all 
these items together and have a specific plan of attack for the upcoming 
weeks.
I propose that we get together next week to follow up on this list of pending 
items and evaluate if it is shrinking or not. 
Kind regards. 





Bill, Mark, Sally  and Max as you all know, the volumes of trades going on in 
Mexico, are increasing very rapidly.  Today, we are doing transactions with 
around 50 different counterparties, and have passed the 55 Bcfs of gas mark, 
while we are trying to put Master Agreements in place, and also working very 
intensively with Credit setting up and evaluating many companies that are not 
public.  The Mexican market is "" In diapers"" in terms of risk management, and 
we are trying very hard to open it up, create awareness, and bring volumes to 
excelr. 

As of last September, excelr was the second largest energy risk management 
trading company in Mexico, second to the state monopoly Pemex.  Today, we can 
tell that our volumes are 250% larger than those in september and most 
probably we are by now the leading risk management company in our country.  
Moreover, for many of our customers, these have been their first transactions 
and because of that we need to make an extra effort to ensure that the day to 
day operations run as smoothly as we can. 

I am sending you a copy of what we have to work on, so that you are in the 
loop, and are aware of the resources that this market is demanding us right 
now.

Thanks for your support and I'll keep you posted.

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

I received your voicemail this morning and I believe the following will 
answer all your questions:

1.  We are actually fine on Friday night dinners and really only need 
interviewers at this time.

2.  For the first weekend - Oct. 28th - To date, I don't see that anyone from 
your area has signed up to interview.  This may be because this is an 
Associate weekend.

3.  For the second weekend - Nov. 4th - The only person signed up is Pat 
Clynes from Logistics.  The second weekend is really large and we still need 
about 67 interviewers.  We are looking for Managers and above to interview.


4.  Attending schools  October 28th - approx. 55 students (Associate) 
    Georgetown
    Rice - Grad
    Michigan
    Thunderbird
    UT- Grad

    November 4th - approx. 100 students (Analyst)
    UT- Undergrad
    A&M
    Baylor
    Rice - Undergrad
    Oklahoma
    Florida

5.  Interviewers must check in at 8:00am for interview discussion and 
breakfast - 50M.  They will pick up their schedule and candidate resumes at 
this time.

6.  Interviewers will see 5 candidates and will be assigned to a interview 
team.  Interviews will be conducted between 8:45 - 12:15.

7.  Interviewer/Candidate lunch will be from 12:30-1:30 - The Energizer

8.  The decision making meeting will begin at 1:30pm in 5C2.  All 
interviewers must attend the decision making meeting.

If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  We would greatly

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS IN A TRADING ENVIRONMENT

To manage operational risk in a trading environment excelr has designed and=
=20
implemented operational control standards. These standards, which are commo=
n=20
for all businesses, aim to prevent errors and inaccuracies and ensure the=
=20
timely recording of trading transactions.=20

What standards does excelr have in place?

excelr has six fundamental standards for risk management that cover:
- Recording transactions
- Reporting daily profit & loss and risk positions
- Confirmation and execution of transactions
- Settlements with counterparties
- Risk management and settlement system information reflected in the genera=
l=20
ledger
- Implementation of business and control infrastructure

What else is important when controls are implemented?

Implementing segregation of duties within the trading environment ensures=
=20
that no individual has control over all phases of a transaction.   This=20
allows incompatible functional responsibilities to be kept separate,=20
specifically:
- Authorization and execution of transactions
- Recording and performance of transactions
- Monitoring and review of trading activities=20

Why do we need to standardised controls?

To assimilate new or build existing commodity businesses excelr needs to be=
=20
nimble and responsive. A robust and stable control process can be duplicate=
d=20
or flexed quickly and confidently, providing scalability and the capability=
=20
to assess and manage operational risk.

How do we measure successful control?

By identifying and reporting metrics for all standards we build an=20
understanding of compliance across all businesses and seek continual=20
improvement. This compliments the qualitative cross-checking process=20
facilitated by communication between Commercial, Risk Management Operations=
=20
and RAC.

The control measurement process will be part of a global initiative across=
=20
all commodities and locations.

Where can you find details of our fundamental standards?

Dear OU Team:

I wanted to send a quick update regarding the rest of the fall recruiting 
season:

According to your recruiting guide, we are scheduled to host a Corporate View 
on October 19 and 20.  This has been changed to November 10.  This event will 
now be co-sponsored (in Houston) with Arthur Andersen and will also involve 
students from the Fellows group at Texas A&M.  We were given this opportunity 
through Tim Rasnic (our JC Penney Leadership contact at OU) and Dr. Tim 
Peterson (the contact for our Texas A&M recruiter).  Details will be sent to 
the group as Tim Rasnic finalizes the logistical details between the 2 groups.

Also, we will be conducting Intern Interviews October 30 and 31.  I realize 
this falls at a time when many of you are interested in being with your 
families (as would I), so please keep in mind that the greater number of 
interviewers we have for this event, the sooner we can all get back home to 
TRICK-OR-TREAT!!!  We will sort through the candidate resumes once I receive 
them from Career Services.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be able to help with 
interviews on day 1 (October 30).    
Just to update you on last week's interviews:
We will be inviting 9 candidates to Super Saturday on November 4.  I will 
send their names and contact information to you after each has been notified.

Thanks to each of you for making this season such a success!
I appreciate the time and help you have all provided!

thanks!

Thanks for the update - I was out late last week for the RAC Conference.

Although the urgency of the situation was stressed when requesting this 
information, we followed up with an email on October 10 to Dan Houston 
(attached below) when it appeared that they would not be able to provide us 
with the information - the email gives an overview of the project and 
stresses the urgency that we obtain the documentation.

As you note that the information was there, have you already completed this 
portion of the deal test?  If not, and you would like for us to complete it, 
would you have the documentation sent to me at 3AC1904?

I have not heard anything from Pam regarding a meeting, but today looks 
good.  Tomorrow and Wednesday I will be in L.A.

Subject: Doorstep - Settlements

Dan,

The RAC group is currently involved in project Doorstep, which includes a 
review of excelr's trading activities worldwide.  Part of the review includes 
a deal test for each office,  in which we follow a transaction from inception 
through the settlements process.

Kyle Gibson has helped us with the settlements by providing some invoices and 
G/L entries for selected transactions.  In fact, given the deadline Kyle 
indicated to us regarding his own group's close, we reduced the deal 
population in half with the hope of concluding our testing by today.  We 
understand that the monthly close will prevent Kyle from helping us any 
further until tomorrow at noon at the earliest, and that he will be absent 
this afternoon.

Given the large number of trading offices worldwide, each ""Doorstep"" is of 
very short duration.  In fact, part of the testing evaluates the ability of a 
group to pull together all of the supporting documentation for a selection of 
deals within a short time frame.  Given the ""short fuse,"" we must finalize 
our report tomorrow at the latest, and present it on Monday to Sally Beck, 
Ted Murphy, Rick Buy, and Rick Carson among others.

It is important that we be able to mention in this report that the 
settlements group is able to gather this information quickly for a small 
number of transactions (10 overall - although some information has already 
been provided by Kyle).  Are there any other resources in your group who 
would be able to help us meet this deadline?

Thanks, Dan,
Ken

Subject: Portland doorstep report - finding followed up on

Dear Ken, Leslie,

It looks like we have gotten to the bottom of the missing documentation (it 
was there, it was quickly available, Ken did talk to the right people but 
they did not see the urgency of getting the information to Ken).  As a 
result, I think we have to rewrite the information related to this issue in 
the Portland report.  Let's get together for 15 minutes today/tomorrow to 
draft a rewrite of these areas.  

Just as a side note, we need to wait until the report has been changed before 
we share the information with Portland.

Pam - could you organize Ken, Leslie and I getting together?

Thanks

Subject: Status - ""PCG wish list""

I just wanted to give you an update on where we are on the PCG wish list.   
We discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our 
list of development/enhancements to our applications.  We met on numerous 
occasions with Mark D. and team to prioritize, etc.  However, I think 
primarily due to the reorg in IT, and Mark leaving the team, we have done a 
lot of talking over the past three weeks, but nothing has happened to date.  
Jennifer and I met with Hal Elrod yesterday, and I have met with Bob Hillier 
a couple of times, and we seem to be on the right track now.  I know Bob 
Hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs.  

My concern is growing due to the fact that Andrew Parsons and team will be 
re-auditing us before the end of the year.  The key control weakness of the 
PCG was the lack of Profiles Manger - I have stressed that this is #1 on the 
list of things to do.  I think we are fairly close, but we will need to start 
and complete testing over the next several weeks.   My hope is that we push 
Andrew back as far as possible!  

Please let me know if you have any questions -

Thanks for your interest, I will add you.

The meeting arose out of a need to identify where clearing needs to be in the 
future.  Legal will address
the legal implications of confirming web based deals.  It was rumored at one 
time that the web based receipt  was sufficient for confirmation of the 
deal.  

This issue as well as many others will be discussed.

Clearing users from London, Calgary, and Houston will have a chance to 
present their requirements. These requirements will  include
a need for web based clearing,  the nature of which  Commodity Logic is 
developing.  We are currently working closely with the Commodity Logic 
project  in
order to assure that the entire process of clearing deals as it exists today  
can be made as efficient as possible.

Web based clearing will be one of many requirements we hope to flush out 
during these meetings,  Based on the requirements we will
work with London to develop a plan that get us where we need to be.

Thanks for the invite, I will try and make it.

Ron, please add me to the list for attendance.  I have just a few questions, 
if you could answer them for me.

Who is requesting/spearheading this meeting?  How does this meeting relate to 
the requirements gathering already done / being done by Commodity Logic?
Isn't this a somewhat redundant effort, albeit a more organized approach?  In 
other words, why would we start a second effort without coordinating it with 
the Commodity Logic effort ?  Are you in competition or something?

Additionally, I should inform you that a company called ConfirmCorp offers a 
service for confirm clearing.  They are coming in Tuesday afternoon to make a 
presentation.  It's probably a good idea if you attend.  The meeting is in

Subject: Oct. 17 RRC letter re continuing audit violations

 I just received a letter from Ed Abrahamson at the Railroad Commission, 
asserting that we have still not fully corrected or explained all of the 
audit violations they previously alleged.  I will have delivered to each of 
you this afternoon a copy of the letter, to which we must respond by October 
27.  The tone of the letter indicates some frustration on the audit staff's 
part, and it will behoove us to try to get the remaining matters resolved 
promptly.
 I will be out of town Monday, but I will have my assistant, Monica Jackson, 
set up a meeting for Tuesday afternoon to discuss how we are going to satisfy 
the Commission regarding the remaining exceptions.  In the meantime, please 
carefully review each item and commence doing whatever needs to be done to be 
in a position to finalize our response by October 26, Thursday of next week.  
I think some of the fixes will be fairly easy, but others will be more 
problematic.  Please provide this memo and a copy of the letter to anyone who 
should be aware or involved.

We discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our 
list of development/enhancements to our applications.  We met on numerous 
occasions with Mark D. and team to prioritize, etc.  However, I think 
primarily due to the reorg in IT, and Mark leaving the team, we have done a 
lot of talking over the past three weeks, but nothing has happened to date.  
Jennifer and I met with Hal Elrod yesterday, and I have met with Bob Hillier 
a couple of times, and we seem to be on the right track now.  I know Bob 
Hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs.  

My concern is growing due to the fact that Andrew Parsons and team will be 
re-auditing us before the end of the year.  The key control weakness of the 
PCG was the lack of Profiles Manger - I have stressed that this is #1 on the 
list of things to do.  I think we are fairly close, but we will need to start 
and complete testing over the next several weeks.   My hope is that we push 
Andrew back as far as possible!

1. Each book adm. now checks his/her own positions that are going into V@R,

Here are a few tips that will immediately improve the time it takes to make a 
offer to your candidates.   

All applicants must fill out and sign an Application and a Fair Credit 
Reporting Act form (included with the application) prior to being 
interviewed.   You may either have the applicant fill out a form before you 
interview them or you can send the applicant to the 36th floor to fill out 
the forms before you interview them.     
Notify Hector McLoughlin or Frank deJesus if you are interviewing an external 
candidate that is a former excelr employee.    All previous excelr employees 
will be reviewed by HR and Sally Beck prior to being invited to interview.   
We hope that this process will eliminate re-hiring poor performers. 
If you want to make an offer of employment to a candidate for a Management 
Position, please include Sally Beck in the process for input.    As a final 
step of the selection process, Sally would like to meet with the candidate if 
time allows or to phone interview the candidate as an alternative.    Sally's 
involvement should occur after you have identified the candidate as a 
potential Management new hire. 

Thanks for your help with this process.

We have figured out why the credit group is getting so many ""New 
Counterparty"" names in gas.  The spreadsheets that they are getting that 
information from are for position purposes only on pipe-optons.  The value is 
captured in TAGG and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would 
be doublecounting credit risk.  The spreadsheet download has a specific 
download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name  (which in 
this case had to be put in as new counterparty.)  I am working with Debbie to 
figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty 
at all from the spreadsheet.  It will be done as quickly as possible.

Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller 
Forum that I am hosting next week.  There will be approximately 30 excelr 
business controllers present at the meeting.  All have responsibility for mid 
and back office operations for the following excelr entities:  excelr North 
America, excelr Europe, excelr South America, excelr Global Markets, excelr 
Industrial Markets, excelr Broadband Services and excelr Energy Services.  
Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New 
York (metals business).   

Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes 
before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to 
be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.  


You are scheduled to address the group as follows:

Date:  Tuesday, October 24, 2000
Time:  8:30 am
  (breakfast will be served at 8:00 and you are invited to join us)
Place:  The Warwick Hotel
  The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 
  5701 Main Street
  Houston,  TX  77005

The group would like to hear about excelr's performance, your outlook for the 
remainder of 2000 and into 2001, your viewpoint on the future of the company 
and next growth opportunities, etc.  With a small group, your talk can be 
informal and you do not need to prepare slides (unless you would like to do 
so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key speaking points that would enforce 
the value of this conference for this group would be:

recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 
2000 

the value you place on the jobs performed by operations controllers to ensure 
integrity in mid and back office functions

the importance of tight operational controls in enabling business growth for 
excelr (your loose/tight analogy would be great, as many have not heard that) 

the independent control role that we play and our responsibility to ""raise 
the flag"" on issues if needed

Subject: Speaking Engagement - October 23, 2000

Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller 
Forum.  I know that we are catching you before a tee time on Monday, so I 
especially appreciate your joining us to kick off the event that morning.  
Dress for the forum is casual, so feel free to do the same.  There will be 
approximately 30 excelr business controllers present at the meeting.  All have 
responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following excelr 
entities:  excelr North America, excelr Europe, excelr South America, excelr 
Global Markets, excelr Industrial Markets, excelr Broadband Services and excelr 
Energy Services.  Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, 
Sydney, London and New York (metals business).   

Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes 
before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to 
be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.  


You are scheduled to address the group as follows:

Date:  Monday, October 23, 2000
Time:  8:00 am
  (breakfast will be served at 7:30 and you are invited to join us)
Place:  The Warwick Hotel
  The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 
  5701 Main Street
  Houston,  TX  77005

With a small group, your talk can be informal and you do not need to prepare 
slides (unless you would like to do so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key 
speaking points that would enforce the value of this conference for this 
group would be:

recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 
2000 
your support for global standards for operational controls for trading 
activities
your recognition of the value of operational professionals in the 
organization to ensure integrity of mid and back office functions  
your challenge to the group to strive for best in class processes and 
controls as excelr's growth as a trading organization continues

Let me know if you have any questions and thanks again for joining us.

Subject: Draft Agenda


Attached is a draft agenda for your review and comments.  As speakers were 
confirmed, the placement of certain items on the agenda were dictated by the 
speakers' schedules and then logical grouping of topics around those 
speakers.  Sunday evening will not be heavy - simple welcome and intros, 
drink and dinner - I know that many will be tired from traveling.  We have 
arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy 
chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a 
means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday.  This 
can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.  

The morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement 
of our efforts (Causey).  Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short 
""state of the union of operations"" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and 
EEL).  Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, 
discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.  

Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in 
which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of 
operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could 
have such an impact.  Each table can report back as we gather to start the 
afternoon.  

Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move 
Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and 
lessons learned.  Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going 
project.  

Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool 
for the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.  

We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its 
impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted 
Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.  

Monday evening will include a tour of excelr Field and dinner at Ruggles 
Center Field Terrace.  Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are 
waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.  

Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.  
He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.  He will make an informal 
presentation and then will entertain questions.  The rest of the morning will 
be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action 
steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information 
provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office 
services within excelr.  

Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.  
Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.  
After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to 
reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against 
our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).  

Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.  The only details still 
in flux are Tom Gros' availability and confirmation of Philippe's 
attendance.

Subject: OU Super Saturday Candidates

Dear OU Team Members and Interviewers:

Thank you for your time and help this recruiting season.  While there is 
still much to do, we are now to the point where we will soon begin to reap 
rewards!

After last week's interview process, we have selected 9 candidates to invite 
to the November 4th Super Saturday.

Those candidates are:
1. Jonathan Beck (405/579-8594)
2. Jeremy Fitzpatrick (405/447-6144)
3. Thomas Lowell (405/573-1103)
4. Jenia Nikolova (405/325-9435)
5. Matthew Olney (405/360-0311)
6. David Scott (405/812-5538)
7. Corrinn Sutton (405/292-7881)
8. Thomas Underwood (405/292-1108)
9. Ryan White (405/292-1470)

I personally called each candidate today to invite them to Super Saturday.  
Their formal letters will be sent later in the week.

Our next step will be to cultivate these candidates.  I will be assigning a 
candidate to selected team members next week for cultivation calls.  In the 
mean time, please feel free to call and congratulate them (just please let me 
know who you call so no one is left out!)

Thanks again for your dedication!

fyi, my comments are:

SAP interface - we discussed an improved solution for implementation in 4th 
Quarter earlier this week

Inactive Employees, etc - In the absence of a corporate process for keeping 
this updated, the Global Managers do periodically review who has access and 
request changes to access based upon their knowledge of current employee 
assignments.  At best, this is a quarterly process.

Passwords -  they are right.  We probably need something.

Stuart,

We have completed our work on the Global Systems (Counterparty, Contracts, 
Facilities, and Common Codes) in accordance with the excelr North America 2000 
Audit Plan.  We met with Sundar Chitradurga and Ravi Arumbakkam on the IT 
side and Mary Solmonson on the business side in order to gain an 
understanding of the application and its environment.  We were provided the 
documentation we requested and are pleased with the cooperation we received.  
We appreciate them making time to work with us in completing this audit.

We have closed our preliminary issues with Sundar and Ravi and we agree on 
the items in the report.  I am attaching a copy of the preliminary report for 
your review.  At excelr's request, the reporting date for the currently open 
business audits has been moved to this Friday, the 20th of October.  They 
were originally scheduled to report on the 27th.

We would like to give you an opportunity to read through this report and meet 
with us to discuss any areas of concern prior to Friday's reporting.  We are 
available today, the 18th, throughout the afternoon and all day tomorrow, 
Thursday the 19th.  I will also call you this afternoon to discuss meeting to 
go over each of these issues.  If you are comfortable with this report and do 
not feel it is necessary for us to meet and discuss it, please let me know.  
After we have agreed on the accuracy of all issues, they will be placed in 
the final reporting format.  We will provide you a copy of the final report 
when it is completed.

We appreciate your cooperation and efforts in this regard.

Thanks,

the interview process, we have chosen 38 Financial Analyst candidates to 
bring to Super Saturday on November 4.  These candidates are:

Amanda Ostrander, Ali Ahmed, Bonnie Chang, Brad Morgan, Brad Staller, Brian 
Falik, Brian Kanatzar, Bryan Willingham, Carol Stauch, Castlen Moore, Doug 
Epperson, Chris Calato, Daniel Bates, Daniel Jenkins, David Eastlake, David 
Michels, Hina Khan, Irfan Iqbal, James Lee, Jason Huang, Jay Raman, Judy 
Maledon, Max Sell, Michael Morris, Natalie Madi, Natascha Seume, Paul Horng, 
Ryan Ruebsahm, Ryan Williams, Sean Steele, Shaleen Miller, Stephen Dexter,
Tayyab Balagamwala, Ty Purdy, Lydia Kuo, Matt Linford, Lauren Szeto, and 
Melanie Sandoval.

I have personally called each of the 38 candidates to let them know they have 
been selected.  They will also receive a formal letter through the mail later 
this week.  This letter will include details regarding November 4.

The interviews for the Tax Analyst position also yielded the following:
5 Spring Internship offers:  Ashley Berger, Yi (Zoe) Zhou, Li Li, Weijing 
Shin, and Xuemei Lang
1 Summer Internship offer: Chia-Lin Lee
2 Full Time Office Visits: Andrew Susman and Amanda Ostrander

The next step is cultivation.  I will assign candidates to targeted team 
members for telephone follow-up calls.  I would also like to have volunteers 
to go to Austin next week to take these candidates to dinner.  Please let me 
know if and when you will be available so that I can begin planning.

Thanks again for all your help and hard work!!!

Dear OU Team:

I wanted to send a quick update regarding the rest of the fall recruiting 
season:

According to your recruiting guide, we are scheduled to host a Corporate View 
on October 19 and 20.  This has been changed to November 10.  This event will 
now be co-sponsored (in Houston) with Arthur Andersen and will also involve 
students from the Fellows group at Texas A&M.  We were given this opportunity 
through Tim Rasnic (our JC Penney Leadership contact at OU) and Dr. Tim 
Peterson (the contact for our Texas A&M recruiter).  Details will be sent to 
the group as Tim Rasnic finalizes the logistical details between the 2 groups.

Also, we will be conducting Intern Interviews October 30 and 31.  I realize 
this falls at a time when many of you are interested in being with your 
families (as would I), so please keep in mind that the greater number of 
interviewers we have for this event, the sooner we can all get back home to 
TRICK-OR-TREAT!!!  We will sort through the candidate resumes once I receive 
them from Career Services.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be able to help with 
interviews on day 1 (October 30).    
Just to update you on last week's interviews:
We will be inviting 9 candidates to Super Saturday on November 4.  I will 
send their names and contact information to you after each has been notified.

Thanks to each of you for making this season such a success!
I appreciate the time and help you have all provided!

Following our Doorstep meeting today, I am following up on your request that 
I forward to you the list of Portland transactions for which we still require 
documentation, e.g. invoices, SAP entries, etc.  For the Settlements testing 
only, we reduced the deal population from 23 to ten randomly-selected 
transactions, in order to facilitate the Settlement group's ability to 
complete both its monthly close obligations and our Doorstep request.  The 
deal selection is indicated in yellow, and the missing items, in green.




Also per your request, attached are the five ""non-standard"" deals for which 
we have been unable to obtain any information at all.  Our primary need is 
just to get a basic understanding of these transactions.

As per your client's request, here is the information I was able to come up 
with concerning derivatives training:

While I recognise the need for a time-efficient approach to derivatives 
training, the benefit of this class will be diminished with any compression 
or omission of subject matter.  It is recommended that the two-day format 
remain the same.

All ""Ernie"" derivatives classes are full for the next three months; however, 
the vendor can provide a ""by invitation only"" D1 class in mid January.  As 
many as 50+/- employees can attend this class during the week of January 
16th.  The proposed schedule is as follows:

1/16/00   1/17/00   1/18/00   1/19/00
D1 (day one)  D1 (day two)  D1 (day one)  D1 (day two)
first 25 people  first 25 people  second 25  second 25
$6000   $6000   $6000   $6000

The vendor is quite booked for the 1st quarter.  They are not able to offer 
D2 until mid March or April if the Mid month schedule is to be followed.  One 
D2 class could be offered on 2/1/00 and 2/2/00 should this be an acceptable 
option.  Another D2 class may be available on 2/8/00 and 2/9/00, but this has 
not been confirmed by the vendor as of yet.  

The daily rate is $6000 for 25 students.  Classes are not recommended to 
exceed 25 people.  We need to get back to the vendor quickly to secure these 
dates if we'd like to do this.  

If you need additional information, please let me know.

Sheri,

It was a pleasure speaking with you today.  Attached is the ICE New User
Enrollment Form.  This is the means by which you can identify the
individuals that are to be set up as ICE users and the level of access (User
Type) to be granted to each.  Of particular importance is the identification
of the individuals who will be acting as the primary Administrative, Credit,
IT, and Invoicing contacts for IntercontinentalExchange.

You will need to complete a separate form for each excelr entity that
executed a Participant Agreement.

If you have any questions, please call me at 770.738.2129.  Thanks for your
interest and we look forward to serving you.

Following our Doorstep meeting today, I am following up on your request that 
I forward to you the list of Portland transactions for which we still require 
documentation, e.g. invoices, SAP entries, etc.  For the Settlements testing 
only, we reduced the deal population from 23 to ten randomly-selected 
transactions, in order to facilitate the Settlement group's ability to 
complete both its monthly close obligations and our Doorstep request.  The 
deal selection is indicated in yellow, and the missing items, in green.




Also per your request, attached are the five ""non-standard"" deals for which 
we have been unable to obtain any information at all.  Our primary need is 
just to get a basic understanding of these transactions.

Colorado Springs Utilities  10/1/98-9/30/03 Colorado 50-150 MWs

Dear Paul,

Thanks for the update.  Can you liase with Al Pennisi and Marcelo Parra to 
look at the R&N information?  We are trying to get a handle on how 
comfortable we are outsourcing the majority of the middle office for the US 
brokerage business.  Not just settlements, but nearly all functions.  Al is 
putting together some information regarding R&N.  Together with Al, Kevin 
Rhodes and Marcelo we should be able to come to a recommendation (either the 
middle office operations is something we should start to do ourselves, or 
that we think it is best to continue to use R&N as an outsourcer for the 
brokerage business).

If you want to discuss call me at 713 853 9123.

visit in September.  I forwarded the attached file to James New and Mike 
Jordan several weeks ago and had hoped to discuss it with them.  I have had 
no response and, therefore, I assume that they agree with the direction that 
was laid out in the departure meeting (Sept. 15) with Gregor, Paul, and Risk 
personnel.

The three areas addressed in the report are as follows:

Pool Book P&L Split
EnPower Structure Modification
Transmission Valuation

Pool Book P&L Split
I have spoken to Anthony MacDonald about the progress and as I understand, he 
has offered to devote time in order to inform James and Coralie Evans about 
the underlying problem.

EnPower Structure Modification
Paul can certainly give you a more detailed understanding as to the Legal 
Entity decision process and amount of rework time that is required of your 
Risk and Confirmation groups.  I have discussed this problem with Zhiyong Wei 
(Houston's EnPower support) in order to inform him of the situation and Paul 
mentioned that he has also spoken with Brian Hudson.

Transmission
As of my last communication with Houston IT, the testing was almost 
complete.  At the departure meeting mentioned above, we considered valuation 
of transmission as a spread-option to be Plan A and further agreed upon a 
Plan B and C.  The report details the operational risk involved in valuing 
transmission by using the Forwards deal type in EnPower.

Since I have communicated with James and Mike and now with the 3 of you, I 
have completed my responsibilities on this project.  We have now formalized a 
direction with backup plans and I would encourage testing by the London 
office to ensure that what meets the West Power desk's needs will also 
address yours. If you need to further discuss this report, feel free to call 
or set up a meeting.

PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING ISSUE:

At the Audit Comittee Meeting, Jeff made the comment that the number of and 
timing of the limit notifications caused them to be meaningless.  Now part of 
that was an attempt by him to diffuse the number of notifications represented 
graphically, but I think that there is an element of truth, particularly of 
late.  therefore, I propose that we work toward making that timing faster and 
the impact more meaningful.  

I think the following might help:
1) Cassandra will be our point person, therefore it will be faster than 
waiting for the slower, more distracted and less organized ME
2) I will propose that we raise the threshholds for notifications, 
particularly at Jeff's level - I think that the sheer volume makes an 
impression on Rick. Unfortunately, I think that it will not be in effect 
until after the Dec bd meeting.  FYI I have proposed this at least twice and 
have been shot down by Greg and Rick, but now that a smart guy is proposing 
it, it will probably get more attention.
3) We should use the executive report viewer as the mechanism for delivery.  
I do not know who actually supports that thing so please let me know.
 It has been important to AA for audit purposes to see ""evidence"" that Rick, 
Jeff, Ken and Bd received appropriate notification - so that needs to be 
considered.
Another possibility would be RisktRAC.  The 3-d solution contracted for 
contains an ""Executive View"" of ""hot spots"" .  Unfortunately, even though 
Jeff requested it on his desk top 5 months ago, we can't get the IT resources 
to pay attention to it.  IT however, has been interviewed several times for 
magazines and have created such incredibly successful and useful products 
such as EnergyDesk.com, Credit.com, En-lighten, 
..............................................................................
..  

Conceptually,
Notifications should take place before trading begins the next day.  This may 
be utopian, but it is fundamentally correct (just because excelr doesn't know 
it is supposed to, doesn't make it right).  I am certain that real risk 
management organizations have a mechanism in place for this.   It  may be 
necessary to create a SWAG process that is lightning fast with a more exact 
process to follow.

Please have fixed by close of business today.

Don't worry about me -- I just thought we should get things moving -- since

anxious to put an announcement out to excelr Europe that Phillip Lord and I 
are leaving and that Melissa will be stepping in to replace us.
Since Phillip already has a place to go, it would be nice if we could at 
least say that I am going to North America Energy Ops, or something -- even 
if we don't have all of the details worked out.

I am not sure if you want me to come over and meet some of your commercial ""

to discuss

Monday is fine -- as I am sure today will be another crazy day.

I know how all of those reviews are.  John Sherriff put a o5 per review per 
day penalty on any dept head who didn't have their reviews  done by August

Crazy week -- 7:00 pm and I just finished a project for Delainey that I got 
at noon today.  Cancelled everything on the calendar and have been immersed 
ever since.  Patti gave me your message with your home number around 5:30 
today, just as she was leaving -- apologized for not giving it to me 
earlier.  However, given my immediate project, I don't think that I could 
have called until now.  And at 1:00am London time, I think that this e:mail 
is much better.  

I am still really crunched tomorrow morning.  All of our mid-year reviews 
must be completed by the time we have our ENA Office of the Chair staff 
meeting at 2:30 tomorrow.  Big push, after an over percentage completion rate 
of about 60% at our ENA meeting two weeks ago.  Some of those unfinished 
reviews were mine to give (16 direct reports is a killer).  I wrote three 
last night after Tyler went to bed, finished at 1:00 am and gave all three 
reviews this morning.  I have 5 more to write tonight, and to deliver 
tomorrow morning to be at 100%.  I will try to call you on my way into the 
office tomorrow morning from the car.  If I miss you then, it will be late 
afternoon Houston time before I could call you.  Next week shapes up to be 
MUCH better.  

I am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations.  Would love

on large transactions, please continue to follow the procedures set forth 
below for transactions where outside legal fees and expenses are expected to

description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The 
responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve 
such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide 
substantial professional services.

 2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised

We began the meeting with a review of the progress to date.   Detail 
transaction flows were discussed including the very important items, Price 
and Volume.  Both will be required daily in groupings.  The changes by day in 
the positions was stated as already being in place.   We then began to 
discuss what we needed to have and what was already present in the current 
system.  Items such as  Groups, Price, Priority, Today's Position, Change in 
Trades, etc were all mentioned as required.

The following is my version of the meeting yesterday.  I hope I captured 
everything correctly and have the proper ""to do"" list included:

We decided that we needed to provide contract details on Evergreen contracts 
and that a copy of a delivery contract  needs to be provided to the team.

A matrix was created which defined which barrel information was in the 
current system and which information was needed but not available.


                    POSITION REPORT STATUS CURRENT


BARREL INFORMATION IN THE REPORT           INFORMATION NOT IN THE REPORT


Exchange Traded barrels     Evergreen
Broker barrels (exchange contracts)   Term to Evergreen
Spot barrels (one day lag in entry)   Lease
Term barrels      Pipeline barrels
OTC        Storage barrels
Swaps        Inventory with a sale against them are
Options       the only barrels in the report



As additional tasks we stated that Tickets to Actuals need to be in the 
Report everyday.  To achieve this we need Right Angle ticket detail 
actualized daily.  We then stated that we need to develop a plan to achieve 
the above
stated needs.

We then agreed on the following:

1.  Create the step by step plan to achieve the daily information goals.
2.   We will define the information fields needed.  Lori and Yolanda will 
work with the DataBase Manager to achieve the necessary information.
3.   We will create the plan to build the analytical data mart from which 
this information will be extracted and reported.
4.  The team will consist of Bjorn Hagelmann, David Hultsman, Lori Maddox,

A few comments :

As discussed it may be useful to see how the doorstep and BRM approaches 
interact - anything written down that explains it ?

I am going to proceed with driving accountability for op risk assessment to 
my controllers - we should discuss at the global offsite if it is worth 
formalising this process - I am totally open to ideas on this.

Lastly, in conversations with Shawn we agreed to delay the full planning for 
European BRM 2001 whilst we finalise this years reports ( lots of activity 
due in October )

Dear Mike,

Thanks for your insight.  In the past few months we have established a 
detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM.  Through 
my calls the past week, I've been trying to update you so we can determine 
how best to coordinate the excelr Europe work, as well as get an understanding 
of what resources you can supply for this global initiative.

My next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to 
determine their skill set and what locations/commodities they'd be best to 
work on.

I'll send you an updated schedule once I've finalized this.

Thanks

Subject: Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an 
internal approach to internal audit

Shawn / Shona

We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to 
take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is (we will need 
to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely):-

Aims
Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support 
teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams.
A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive 
on-going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking.
Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully 
leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused 
by it
All elements of implementing, completing and reviewing internal control 
should generate defined output
We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and 
origination controls (we have defined the control structure for trading 
offices, agency offices and origination offices and we must police our 
labelling for each office)
The output from excelr's perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be 
discussed at control/governance meetings (eg at Sally/Ted/Fernley's level and 
at the audit committee level) - the important issue here is that every list 
must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have 
different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior/experienced 
staff 
The output from AA's perspective is their internal controls audit opinion 
based upon our database and our review and management process of it

Trading Process - monthly
Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction 
cycle - rating made by business controller is red, amber, green - with trend 
indicator of static, improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full 
listing
Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see 
attachment 1 (you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment 
2 - and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not 
solely drive the judgement within the self assessment) - Shona, this is the 
work that Mike Moscoso is leading
Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss 
operational risk and areas of concern (red and amber) with agreement of 
action plans for such areas
Monthly review by controller/senior controller of database where all high 
(red) and medium (amber) risk issues are recorded.  Milestones for action 
plans revisited, reconfirmed or amended
Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if 
the risk rating for any remote offices has changed
All new information on issues raised by self assessment, doorstep review or 
BRM completion populated into database
Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and 
decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment

Process - Yearly Planning
Checkpoint taken of
current operational environment (say end Oct)
proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in 
office, and
IT development plans for next year
Prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what 
depth does report need to go to.  Note the doorstep review would be an end to 
end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review 
of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the 
review effort on areas of concern, the actions plans in place and concluding 
on the 'mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level'
Prioritisation made for BRM - which functions, NOT BUSINESS UNITS, require 
external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and 
doorstep processes (could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal 
governance process?) - most likely reviews completed on functions that 
assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as FX exposure 
management, cash management, credit exposure management, IT change management 
controls/process

Where are we NOW - if we all thought to do this immediately

We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - I 
am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston 
offsite do this? 23rd Oct
The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as 
senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week Oct
We agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep 
databases - November
Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate 
the database from scratch - November
Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and 
remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to 
visit all? - November
Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning - 
end November to end December !!

Wow - lets chat about this

Subject: RAC issues

Fernley

Output from a meeting with David and James on the specific issues :-

David's view is that a detailed factual list of issues is as yet not 
available but the summary is as follows :-

At present Europe is substantially hitting the two key deadlines of 
'officialisation' of the books by Risk management by 6 am Houston time and 
Summary DPR received in Houston by Noon ( indeed have internal deadlines 1 
hour before that for contingency )
However, there are some IT problems in that the feeds to Houston post 
officialisation are currently taking a number of hours - and IT are currently 
looking to rewriting feeds and purchasing a dedicated server for feeding to 
Risktrac.
Additionally, because of the time difference between the two targets and the 
fact that Risk Managament do not obtain MTM information until completion of 
the overnight batch ( ie start working first thing in morning UK time ) there 
has been scope for continuing to work on the raw MTM data. Consequently,
there is potential for Risk Management 'top siding' for corrections such that 
the summary DPR will be 'different' from the risktrac information - We do 
topsides because it is impossible, given current systems, to rerun the 
overnight batch and extract the data from the valuation systems - our p&l 
explain processes are themselves spreadsheet based.
The majority of topsides are caused by inaccurate data capture at the deal 
entry stage - itself a symptom of underinvestment in the data validation 
process of risk systems
Whilst the topside adjustment is communicated to Houston  - Risktrac requires 
a fully automated process
Whilst we should consider the materiality of the topside - RAC rightly are 
trying to implement zero tolerance - to help flag all the issues
Within the last fortnight we once received the incorrect curves on UK Power 
such that the full database was incorrectly valued - there was insufficient 
time ( for reason stated above ) to rerun and reextract and indeed today the 
batch failed because the UK Power server ran out of processing diskspace.

We are doing a reasonably good job given the significant systems inadequacies 
we face ( and that have been flagged on a continuous basis - they are on the 
long list for development ).

The recent daily taskforce meetings will provide more structured reporting of 
the root causes that will allow better escalation of systemic issues - and we 
should seek to discuss these in the context of the goal of corporate policy 
compliance ( we should recommunicate the policy internally within Europe )

I spoke with Todd Burke regarding a retention strategy for the managers we

retention without market data.

Subject: Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an 
internal approach to internal audit

Shawn / Shona

We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to 
take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is (we will need 
to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely):-

Aims
Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support 
teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams.
A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive 
on-going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking.
Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully 
leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused 
by it
All elements of implementing, completing and reviewing internal control 
should generate defined output
We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and 
origination controls (we have defined the control structure for trading 
offices, agency offices and origination offices and we must police our 
labelling for each office)
The output from excelr's perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be 
discussed at control/governance meetings (eg at Sally/Ted/Fernley's level and 
at the audit committee level) - the important issue here is that every list 
must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have 
different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior/experienced 
staff 
The output from AA's perspective is their internal controls audit opinion 
based upon our database and our review and management process of it

Trading Process - monthly
Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction 
cycle - rating made by business controller is red, amber, green - with trend 
indicator of static, improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full 
listing
Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see 
attachment 1 (you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment 
2 - and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not 
solely drive the judgement within the self assessment) - Shona, this is the 
work that Mike Moscoso is leading
Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss 
operational risk and areas of concern (red and amber) with agreement of 
action plans for such areas
Monthly review by controller/senior controller of database where all high 
(red) and medium (amber) risk issues are recorded.  Milestones for action 
plans revisited, reconfirmed or amended
Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if 
the risk rating for any remote offices has changed
All new information on issues raised by self assessment, doorstep review or 
BRM completion populated into database
Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and 
decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment

Process - Yearly Planning
Checkpoint taken of
current operational environment (say end Oct)
proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in 
office, and
IT development plans for next year
Prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what 
depth does report need to go to.  Note the doorstep review would be an end to 
end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review 
of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the 
review effort on areas of concern, the actions plans in place and concluding 
on the 'mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level'
Prioritisation made for BRM - which functions, NOT BUSINESS UNITS, require 
external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and 
doorstep processes (could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal 
governance process?) - most likely reviews completed on functions that 
assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as FX exposure 
management, cash management, credit exposure management, IT change management 
controls/process

Where are we NOW - if we all thought to do this immediately

We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - I 
am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston 
offsite do this? 23rd Oct
The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as 
senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week Oct
We agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep 
databases - November
Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate 
the database from scratch - November
Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and 
remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to 
visit all? - November
Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning - 
end November to end December !!

Wow - lets chat about this

2 - and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not 
solely drive the judgement within the self assessment) - Shona, this is the 
work that Mike Moscoso is leading
Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss 
operational risk and areas of concern (red and amber) with agreement of 
action plans for such areas
Monthly review by controller/senior controller of database where all high 
(red) and medium (amber) risk issues are recorded.  Milestones for action 
plans revisited, reconfirmed or amended
Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if 
the risk rating for any remote offices has changed
All new information on issues raised by self assessment, doorstep review or 
BRM completion populated into database
Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and 
decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment

Process - Yearly Planning
Checkpoint taken of
current operational environment (say end Oct)
proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in 
office, and
IT development plans for next year
Prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what 
depth does report need to go to.  Note the doorstep review would be an end to 
end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review 
of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the 
review effort on areas of concern, the actions plans in place and concluding 
on the 'mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level'
Prioritisation made for BRM - which functions, NOT BUSINESS UNITS, require 
external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and 
doorstep processes (could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal 
governance process?) - most likely reviews completed on functions that 
assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as FX exposure 
management, cash management, credit exposure management, IT change management 
controls/process

Where are we NOW - if we all thought to do this immediately

We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - I 
am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston 
offsite do this? 23rd Oct
The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as 
senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week Oct
We agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep 
databases - November
Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate 
the database from scratch - November
Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and 
remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to 
visit all? - November
Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning - 
end November to end December !!

Wow - lets chat about this

Mike

teams, two of the seven teams that I introduced at the conference in San 
Antonio.  This full-day meeting will begin at 8 am on Wednesday, October 18 
at the Crown Plaza Hotel, 2222 West Loop South.  This is an important next 
step in completing the SAP implementation and achieving the benefits that we 
identified before Project Apollo and Beyond began. 

The objectives of this meeting will be 1) to identify management's 
information needs and priorities related to the accounting and reporting 
processes and 2) to prioritize and focus the efforts of the Process 
Leveraging and Reporting teams based on management's needs and priorities.  
Therefore, it is very important for you to attend, to ensure that your BU's 
needs and priorities are considered in these projects.  I realize that this 
is a very busy time, but it will probably continue to be busy through yearend 
close.  If we can get started as soon as possible, it is my hope that we can 
complete the projects and see the results soon, possibly by the January close.

Attached is a list of questions and other information that you should 
assemble and bring with you to the meeting so that we can make 
better-informed decisions.  We will collect your completed information sheets 
to use for further analysis and follow-up after the meeting.  If you have 
questions in completing the pre-work items, please contact Jan Johnson at 
x33260. 

A preliminary agenda is also attached.   Please plan to attend the entire 
day, as individual segments of the agenda will not make sense without full 
participation

Please RSVP to Dortha Gray (x35903) by tomorrow at 2pm.  A continental 
breakfast and buffet lunch will be provided.  If you are unable to attend, 
let me know who will represent you.  Thanks for your help.

I'll be there, and look forward to the event.

Is there an agenda, I wonder when it all starts on the Sunday. I plan to fly 
out on the Sunday, and go back on Thursday morning, so I can spend a few days 
at the office as well.

completes the pay practices survery by Mid-November in order to accurately

retention without market data.

Hi, Sally--am sure you are glad to be back from cold, dark, cruel Oklahoma!

We will need to drive over early Saturday.  Brigeda has an art lesson at 4pm
on Fridays so we wouldn't be able to hit the road until pretty late.

Found out this morning she has pneumonia--has had a cough I decided I should
check out--although she is not contagious and is staying in school...

Brigeda went shopping with your Gap card this weekend--she thought it was
just too cool.  She is very conservative with money so she shopped the sale
racks.  I stayed out of the selection process totally--certainly a sign of
things to come!  She picked out two jean skirts and two shirts--no doubt she
will wear them to your house--I believe that she is trying to look/dress
like Amanda.  (I did, however, dissuade her from buying the leather
pants--told her that would be way too sweaty!)

Looking forward to seeing you all on Saturday.  We'll plan to hit the road
by 9.

Cindy

Subject: Re: September Status Report  

Good.  It is nice to get a recap of what's going on.

A few comments....

1) Can I see the OPM vision document?

2) MKM Phase I - what's included?  what's the business benefit?

3) MKM - Decommisioning of Phoenix.  I think you might be getting a little 
ahead of yourself here.  First you will need to integrate MKM with EnPower, 
Unify, and Sitara.  What are the plans for that?  I also think the delay in 
the Calculation component could be a problem.  For instance, we currently use 
spreadsheets to calculate the average prices and then key them into Unify 
(maybe Phoenix).  We do this because we don't have the ability to key 
anything into either Phoenix or MKM.  How will we do this if Phoenix goes 
away?  I want to make sure the process is thoroughly thought through here.

4) MKM - Support of both Phoenix and LIM is a duplication of efforts and 
costly.....   The plans here need to go back to the vision.  Where is the 
step by step plan of getting to the vision?

5) GRS Support - The most important interim priority is not reflected here 
which concerns me.  Because Reuters accuracy is so poor, the most critical 
thing we need is the ability to select an alternate source for pricing, such 
as CQG, for the downloads!

6) GRS Support - OPIS validation.  This is a business issue and I'm not sure 
this should be reflected in your status report, but you do need to make sure 
Steve gets on this.


Clearly from this, I think good coordination and project management is still 
lacking in the Rates/MKM world.  Is Stuart calling the shots (Phoenix 
decommisioning) or are we?

I hate to sound like a broken record, but our lack of IT support has now 
reached a critical point.  We need to begin work immediately on legacy system 
integration--basically modifying our existing systems (Unify, Sitara, 
Enpower,...) to generate first columnar and then (hopefully) XML data 
output.  This work is most appropriately done by the people who best know 
these systems, our IT group.

The development of the three modules is proceeding well.  We have designed 
the architecture to allow limited-capability versions of all three by the end 
of this year.  The key critical path item remains legacy system integration.  
The key step towards integration is the appointment of a senior IT person on 
our team.  Please let me know what I can do to help in this regard.

All the best,

office), I wanted to close the loop on some of the discussions we've all been 
having on Doorstep.  After talking with Rick Carson,  Shona and I see several 
alternatives:

Our Needs:
1) Database Management
2) Staff to do the deal test and write the report

No matter what, we want to use Rick Carson's group to maintain the Doorstep 
database.  

Our Goals:
The one open question we need to resolve is whether or not Rick Buy does in 
fact want Rick Carson's group to develop trading expertise with the goal of 
being able to do Doorstep visits alone without the involvement of Market Risk 
Management (MRM) or Sally's (Ops) group.  Rick Carson indicated that was his 
understanding from talking to Rick Buy.  If that is the case, we should 
select alternative #1 below, despite the inefficiencies.

If we are simply trying to carry out the Doorstep initiative in the most 
efficient manner possible, it seems Carson's involvement is not actually the 
way to get there.

Alternatives:
1)  Include Rick Carson's group to staff the deal test while including them 
in planning, interviews, etc. 
  - RC does not have low level people to do deal test only; his people are 
experienced managers/directors who would only
  be interested in participating if they were learning the trading business; 
it is also a management problem for his staff to be
  under someone else's direction so he wants their more active involvement

  Pros: - inclusion in interviews might shorten turn around time for them 
documenting the findings in the report
   - training of a RC's group - is this in fact a goal?
   
  Cons: - no real need for a 3rd level of ""brains"" - we just need brawn
   -involvement by 3 or more people in interviews might be intimidating to 
target personnel, may be inefficient, etc.
   - planning and oversight with 3 groups ""in charge"" is inefficient and 
could cause accountability question

2) Don't use Rick Carson's group except for database management: Instead, 
consider one of the following:
 A) Have the MRM and Ops people assigned to the Doorstep do the deal test and 
write the report; bring a staff level person from MRM or Ops to
  do the deal test
   
  Pros: Efficient, keeps expertise and training within our two groups who can 
benefit most directly as trading is our focus (vs. Carson's group), no
   issue with managing staff, etc.; 

  Issue: Do our two groups (MRM and Ops) have resources necessary to devote? 

 B) Outsource to AA

  Cons: Little leverage on timeliness of report, not developing in house 
expertise, expensive, 


 C) See if there are other internal resources like the Business Risk 
Management / Energy Assurance Services group (Internal Audit), or 
accountants   from Causey's other groups, etc.


Assuming Buy does  not actually plan to transfer responsbility for Doorstep 
to Carson's group, I think Shona and I are leaning toward 2A  - it depends on 
what you two think about it - I think our staff level people would welcome 
the opportunity to participate and see other offices - the question is can we 
afford time wise for them to do so.  But if we want to train Carson's group 
with the idea of them eventually becoming the primary RAC Doorstep interface, 
we can do that instead.

Let us know what you think so we can finalize our staffing plans.

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about, 
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of 
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being 
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary 
issue to your attention.  

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which 
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will 
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time 
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for 
consistency amongst the program participants.  

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could 
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the 
blow"".

I look forward to your response.

I have completed internal feedback forms through the PEP system for Brent 
Price, Bob Hall and Peggy Hedstrom.  Those appeared to be the only names that 
you included for which you wanted my input.  Somehow, from Andrea's voice 
mail message last week, I had anticipated responding to more requests - I 
thought perhaps input in working with Wes within ENA or Melissa on SAP.  
Those weren't  on my list within the PEP system, so I just wanted you to know 
that I have responded to the three that were there.  If there was intent for 
me to respond to any others, they weren't accessible in the system. (Believe 
me, I am not asking for more - just wanted to be sure that what I saw in PEP 
as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response).  --Sally

Subject: Re: RAC Feeds 29-Sep  

Debbie,

For UK Power, this was not officialised because we had a curve shift for 25+ 
years which was made in error. For the DPR we put a 'top side' adjustment 
through but because of the time it would take to re calc no re calc was 
performed. This should have been covered in the daily conference call. Was it 
?

For UK Gas, I thought this issue was closed on the conference call. We used 
the 30th as our month end as a result of the way the month end fell. The guys 
have now clicked the 'officialised' button for the 29th if it helps you, but 
we did not use that data (there shouldn't be anything materially wrong with 
it though).

What I think this highlights is that we will have days where we do not 
officialise and do not re run. In these circumstances we will put a top side 
through. We therefore need a mechanism to communicate this top side and I 
would request we get this in place as soon as possible (this has been 
requested a few times before).

Does this answer your questions ?

James

Just received a note fron Steve Price that UK power was never approved for 
close of business 02-Oct. Can you or someone in your group respond to that as 
well as to my query as to the lack of approval for UK Gas for close of 
business on 29-Sep?( See below)

We are making a real effort here to understand why the Risk Controls groups

There is an MTM for the 29-Sep but is has not been approved. However, there

25128,beck-s/all_documents/1296.,<22124937.1075855775668.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Dear all,

If you recall, several months ago we held a meeting to discuss the bonus 
planning needs for Commercial and Commercial Support Analysts now that they 
have been combined into one program under the A/A Program umbrella.

I was asked to put together some information on how bonuses in 1999 compared 
between Merchant Service Analysts, Commercial Analysts and Commercial Support 
Sr. Specialists (and possibly even Managers) so that we could determine if 
there would be a 2000 bonus compression problem in Analysts being placed in 
Commercial Support positions and then having lower bonuses.  Attached below 
you will find the results of that research.

In short the conclusions are these:
The 2000 system allows a difference between Commercial and Commercial Support 
Analyst bonus matrices preventing the compression problem.
In 1999, Commercial Analyst and Commercial Support Sr. Specialist bonus 
matrices were comparable - and this can still occur in 2000.
Bonus structures can easily be planned for 2000 so that no compression 
problem occurs.



The data above is being sent to help you understand the concepts we discussed 
and put closure to the meeting.  The 2000 bonus planning system allows for a 
variation within Analyst categories (commercial and commercial support) and 
will meet the business needs.  Please let me know if you want to discuss 
further or would like to see the raw data used in the research.

Thanks for sending the excelr article--thought it was great--brought it in to

Pictures of the girls were much appreciated--can't really believe how old
they look.  Brigeda's has taken possession of them and put them on her
bulletin board--although she wanted BIGGER ones like Grandmom--told her
Grandmoms always got bigger ones....Brigeda gets her picture taken next week
and will send you one--last year's was so dorky we didn't circulate them
much...

Dad actually seemed better yesterday.  He was making jokes and his voice was
a little stronger--he's on pain medication for his tongue--I think giving
him something to make him relax really does help--he wasn't loopy just not
quite so tense.   He seemed very ""up"" for the dr's appt in Houston.  I told
him you asked Fabe for the best ENT in Houston and that this guy was in your
church and did Meagan's tonsils.  He liked all of that information a
lot...thanks again for arranging this.  Mom and I decided if anyone could
get him to a doctor on short notice you would be able to do it--now the
pressure is on!

Hope you have a great weekend--Brigeda and I are looking forward to see you
guys next weekend.

Thanks for the e-mail regarding summer interns.  I apologize that Lexi and=

that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin=

=20
available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any=
=20
member of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to=
=20
explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set =
it.

You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20
permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As=
=20
you are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting=
=20
firm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark=
et=20
research projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20
required much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20
shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10=
=20
years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm=
s,=20
begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20
actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns=
=20
until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,=
=20
Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first=
=20
year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui=
t=20
in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for=
=20
""spring"" internships.

The recruiting strategy at excelr is no different this year than it was last=
=20
year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &=
=20
February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that=
=20
did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope=
. =20
We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20
because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.

Utilizing this strategy did not impair excelr=01,s ability to hire quality s=
ummer=20
interns.  This past summer excelr had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and=
=20
40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20
summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20
assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20
offers to join excelr.  =20

The reason excelr has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20
summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20
undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20
particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms=
=20
that Jeff Skilling identifies as excelr's competitors.  Because the=20
undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20
continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the=
re=20
were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).

With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about=
=20
which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y=
ou=20
indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve=
r,=20
provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken=
=20
therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.

While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained=
=20
from UT.

o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20
o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on=
=20
campus conduct interviews in the fall for ""summer"" internships.  Cindy=20
attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring=
,=20
or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct=
=20
all interviews  at one time. =20
o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting =
on=20
campus recruit in the spring for summer internships.

We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t=
he=20
statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such=
=20
information. =20

It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20
different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20
individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for=
=20
the discrepancies.

While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20
different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie=
ve=20
that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20
supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20
already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview=

Thanks for the update.  I appreciate your input as I do not know what your 
discussions with Rick Buy have been.  To address your points below:

1)  I agree that your team should be involved in the planning of each 
individual review although I am under the impression that Ted & Sally (by 
proxy Cassandra and I) would set the scope & timing of the reviews while your 
group would be looped in to the planning for each individual process.  If my 
understanding is incorrect, please let me know.  

2) I agree that it would be useful for everyone to attend all meetings.  
However, due to the limited time we have from arriving at the doorstep to 
delivery of the report to Ted and Sally, your group really has to be focused 
on completing the deal test.    We don't need three different people 
obtaining the same information at the same meetings.  If there has been a 
change in your group's role from what I originally understood (we need lower 
level people from your team who would be able to execute a deal test) , we 
may have to add additional resources to do the actual deal test to ensure it 
is done on time (by the time we leave the site). 

3)  Agreed - I'd like to hear what Donna and Mike Neeves have resolved as far 
as the database is concerned before we meet again.

Best regards

Shona

Shona:  Thank you for your memo.  I think it is a good idea to define roles 
and responsibilities and I appreciate the fact  that you have taken the 
initiative to do so.  However, I do have the following comments:

1) I have some accountability to Rick Buy for the success of this effort, 
therefore I (or my designee) need to be involved in Doorstep pre- planning 
and post-mortem.  I will be involved in reviewing the final report before 
presentation and will attend  the meeting when the report is presented to Buy 
and Causey.

2) I realize that  in the interest of getting a review done timely it is 
sometimes necessary to ""divide and conquer"".  However, where logistically 
possible, I believe that it makes sense for my people to be involved in 
meetings held with Commercial personnel.  This facilitates understanding 
operations, document flow, points of contact, report writing as well as 
furthering our goal of educating ""multi-functional"" people so that we can 
continue to reduce the resources necessary to perform these reviews.

3) There are still some detailed issues that need to be clarified regarding 
the database.  Let's schedule another meeting with Cassandra and Donna.

Thanks for the e-mail regarding summer interns.  I apologize that Lexi and=
=20
Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking.  I wis=
h=20
that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin=
g=20
difficulty.  I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was=
=20
available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any=
=20
member of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to=
=20
explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set =
it.

You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20
permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As=
=20
you are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting=
=20
firm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark=
et=20
research projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20
required much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20
shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10=
=20
years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm=
s,=20
begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20
actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns=
=20
until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,=
=20
Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first=
=20
year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui=
t=20
in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for=
=20
""spring"" internships.

The recruiting strategy at excelr is no different this year than it was last=
=20
year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &=
=20
February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that=
=20
did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope=
. =20
We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20
because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.

Utilizing this strategy did not impair excelr=01,s ability to hire quality s=
ummer=20
interns.  This past summer excelr had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and=
=20
40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20
summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20
assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20
offers to join excelr.  =20

The reason excelr has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20
summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20
undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20
particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms=
=20
that Jeff Skilling identifies as excelr's competitors.  Because the=20
undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20
continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the=
re=20
were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).

With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about=
=20
which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y=
ou=20
indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve=
r,=20
provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken=
=20
therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.

While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained=
=20
from UT.

o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20
o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on=
=20
campus conduct interviews in the fall for ""summer"" internships.  Cindy=20
attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring=
,=20
or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct=
=20
all interviews  at one time. =20
o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting =
on=20
campus recruit in the spring for summer internships.

We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t=
he=20
statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such=
=20
information. =20

It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20
different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20
individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for=
=20
the discrepancies.

While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20
different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie=
ve=20
that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20
supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20
already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview=
=20
process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in=

Inja,

Per the conference call today I am confident that we can add value to the
Commodity Logic Project. I base this on the success of excelr Online and
Valtech's role of supporting that effort. Currently, We have the Architect
(David Jayakaran) that designed the presentation framework for EOL available
as part of the team. I mention this because of the obvious synergy between
the EOL framework and Commodity Logic. As discussed David will meet with you
on Wednesday. The action items I owe you are the excelr negotiated rate
structure and profiles for consultants that could start immediately. The
daily rates are senior consultants at $2,000 and consultants at $1,750.  The
profiles are attached for your review. Please contact me if you have any
questions.

So, of course, we responded immediately and met with them for about an hour 
on what they want to do.  I knew we were going to start trading steel, but 
had not heard from Dave that we were going to do this online.  So, I sent 
Andy and Dave the message below detailing the discussion and asked for 
thoughts/concerns going forward.  This will not require any technical 
changes, enhancements, etc., and should be very easy for us to handle....  I 
received the responses below from Dave, and sent him my response.  I am not 
sure if he is upset that they called me instead of him, but there is no

And the intention was to inform them both in case they did have concerns.

I am on vacation beginning this afternoon, and will return on Monday (I am

I would appreciate being privy to some of this information in the future so 
that I do not get blindsided going forward.  Greg called me directly 
yesterday and wanted to discuss this immediately.  EIM will be offering the 
products and we did discuss the metals effort and coordination of such.  

fyi - Amita gave Greg my name as the contact.

Jayshree approached me on behalf of Greg, Jason and Sean about two weeks ago 
to set up a meeting. I informed her at that time that we were in the throes 
of Phase 2 launch and that we were focussed on their LME products and that we 
should meet after Phase 2.

I have also exchanged voice mails on same with Sean and have had recent 
discussions with Bruce Garner on Steel, excelr Network Partners and excelr 
Metals and the relationship between them.

As you know, Amita has worldwide responsibility for metals on excelrOnline. 
Although the Steel group is under separate ownership from Aluminum and 
Copper, there is obviously a degree of overlap.

It is important that the Steel launch is coordinated with our other metals 
activities and that all the usual bases are covered (Marketing launch 
processes, commercial review of contracts, products and structure, regulatory 
compliance, application training, etc.).

I am planning to meet Greg and Sean next week in Houston to discuss the 
above, their launch timetable and coordination with an expressed desire to 
create an excelr Steel vertical.

Please do not do anything further until I have had an opportunity to meet 
Greg and Sean and have assigned someone to take responsibility for 
coordinating all of the launch elements and to act as a central point of 
contact.

Thanks,

Dave

Andy-

We (Jennifer, Rob and I) just met with Greg Hermans who will be heading up 
the steel trading group here in the U.S (Jason Seigal and Sean Keenan were 
also present).  They want to start trading asap - we gathered all the initial 
information we would need to get the product type set up.  Here are the facts:

Financial products only (but he wants to offer physical products in the near 
future.  The issue is that back office logistics systems to physically move 
the product do not exist  - the same challenge the paper guys have).
We are not trading this product OTC yet
The GTC's and long descriptions are in draft format.  Harry Collins (Legal) 
is working on - Rob Cass has already talked to Harry and I think we are close 
on this
The key customer list consists of approx. 50 customers (450 additional) - we 
requested this by Friday so that Credit can get started.  I will send a note 
to Debbie Brackett tonight.  As you can imagine, most of these are customers 
we are not currently doing business with, and the steel industry has not been 
the most profitable the last few years, so I am not sure how many of these 
will even get approved.
Back office systems - they have not decided what they are going to use yet -  
Sitara, TAGG or some other system (really irrelevant for you, but we will 
bridge to whatever system they choose if the number of transactions warrant 
this)
They have not determined which index/publication they will use (most likely 
something called Metal Bulletin)
The first two product types will be Hot Rolled and Cold Rolled
All products will be offered in USD
We need to determine if the products will be offered by EIM or ENA - I am 
fairly sure it will be ENA, but we are discussing with legal.  Greg was not 
sure...


This may not be news to you, but just in case, I wanted to make sure you were 
in the loop.   Please let me know if you have any thoughts/concerns.

Thanks
Sheri

Dan and Tom,
As we discussed, I am aggressively seeking well qualified top talent 
permanent and contract personnel for both Commodity Logic and Deal Bench.  We 
have specified our requirement for specialized technical experience 
(WebLogic, Java, JSP, HTML) and we are receiving many promising resumes in 
response.  We talked with Andersen Consulting, PriceWarterhouse, Enform, 
Valtech, Common Vision, Delinea, etc. and we made it clear that we want them 
to augment our permanent staff rather than doing a turn-key operation to 
which they have all agreed.

Attached are some of the preliminary resumes and fee schedules from EnFORM, 
we expect many others to be in approximately same range of rates.  If you 
have any questions, please let me know.
      Thanks,

Again, it was a pleasure meeting with you yesterday.  As promised, I am
sending the resumes of candidate architects and developers along with a
short proposal for your review.   I also included the resumes of a few very
capable Junior Developers in case you see a need for additional horsepower
at a very low rate.   If possible, I would like to stop by for a short 10-15
minute meeting with you on Monday so I can deliver a hard copy and then walk
you through our proposal.

individuals very aggressively.  I look forward to working with you in the
near future.

Hello, 

Thank you in advance for taking the time to review Zach's resume for 
potential opportunities at excelr.? I appreciate your offer to identify if 
there are areas within excelr that could utilize his technical, business and 
project implementation skills.

Zach has worked the past 4 years as a technical consultant in our Customer 
Relationship Management practice of Deloitte Consulting.? His experience 
demonstrates a broad range of technical and business expertise working for 
clients such as the State of California, Puget Sound Energy and Kaiser 
Permanente.? Zach also played an integral role in the international 
e-commerce project based in Switzerland.

Zach is interested in finding a position which will enable him to leverage 
his technical skills in a business role for a company.? His contact 
information is listed on his resume if you feel as though his skills would 
meet the needs of a division within excelr.

Thank you again for your time,

Sally,

Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly 
to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as 
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very 
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that 
you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you 
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that 
momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most 
don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I 
have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we 
wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to 
accomplish with their guidelines.

Please keep me up informed on this matter.

Thanks and good luck with the students.

Subject: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns


While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with excelr, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on excelr's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
excelr by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that excelr is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which excelr recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the excelr message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for excelr extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many excelr participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.

Hope you are well, and enjoyed the weekend.  It was much too short for us!!  

I was wondering what the next steps are in terms of formalizing the role that 
you and I discussed in San Antonio.

As Fernley gets closer and closer to nailing my replacement, I am feeling 
more and more exposed.

As much as Rick and others have told me not to worry, it would be nice to 
nail it down.

I really do think that I would benefit greatly from more of a middle office 
focus, and have the management skills to supervise a large team of people.  I 
know I would bring a new perspective to the role, coming from more of a back 
office focus, and after my European experience know how to focus on key 
controls.



Do I need to do anything?    I have discussed February departure timing with 
Fernley and he is fine with it.  Depending upon my replacement, it could be 
sooner.

I would need a few weeks to get things wrapped up in London like moving and 
packing etc.  and re-established in Houston  -- need to buy cars etc.

but otherwise there shouldn't be too much downtime between places.

Glad to discuss at any time  x830 6639

Subject: Phoenix Rate Server Problems

All,

It appears that the Phoenix Rate Server was down for the time period in 
question.  Apparently some new Unix folks decided to clean up some files on 
the Phoenix box and deleted some Phoenix system files.  Phoenix only has 1 
support person and he is out on vacation.  Someone from the Sitara production 
support team was able to restart the system today and the extract was rerun.  
We are currently re-running the mass draft to pick up the new rates.  We 
should be good to go for Tuesday 6:00 am.

Subject: Phoenix Rate Server Problems

All,

It appears that we have not been picking up rates from Phoenix since December 
24th (the job was finishing, just not picking up any rates).  At first glance 
the problem may be related to our losing access to the Phoenix server.  We 
plan on the following action:

1) Run the mass drafts as planned tonight.
2) Determine and fix the cause of the problem with the rate server load on 
Monday, January 1st.  The rate server load process will then be rerun for the 
missing time periods. 
3) Rerun the current month mass drafts for all gas entities on Monday, 
January 1st.  Prior months should not be affected.
4) Put better detective controls in place to make sure any problems in the 
future get identified as they occur.

excelr Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by excelr during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of excelr attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.
